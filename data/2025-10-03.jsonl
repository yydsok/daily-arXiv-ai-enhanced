These limitations can be sensitive to\nunmodelled disturbances acting on the robot. Inspired by a factor-graph\noptimization paradigm, this work introduces a continuous-time stochastic state\nestimation framework for continuum robots. We introduce factors based on\ncontinuous-time kinematics that are corrupted by a white noise Gaussian process\n(GP). By using a simple robot model paired with high-rate sensing, we show\nadaptability to unmodelled external forces and data dropout. The result\ncontains an estimate of the mean and covariance for the robot's pose, velocity,\nand strain, each of which can be interpolated continuously in time or space.\nThis same interpolation scheme can be used during estimation, allowing for\ninclusion of measurements on states that are not explicitly estimated.

In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space.

The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints.

While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario.

Both\nframeworks autonomously handle data preprocessing, neural network development,\ntraining, hyperparameter optimization, and uncertainty quantification (UQ). We\nvalidate our approach using a critical heat flux (CHF) prediction benchmark,\ninvolving approximately 25,000 experimental data points from the OECD/NEA\nbenchmark dataset. Results indicate that our LLM-agent-developed model\nsurpasses traditional CHF lookup tables and delivers predictive accuracy and UQ\non par with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimized deep neural network models\ndeveloped by human experts. These outcomes underscore the significant potential\nof LLM-based agents to automate complex engineering modeling tasks, greatly\nreducing human workload while meeting or exceeding existing standards of\npredictive performance."}

To address these\nlimitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based\nconnected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection\nand convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar\nregions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and\naccurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a\nresolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time\nfor locomotion tasks.

Although state-of-the-art VLAs achieve\nstrong performance in downstream robotic applications, supported by large-scale\ncrowd-sourced robot training data, they still inevitably encounter failures\nduring execution. Enabling robots to reason about and recover from\nunpredictable and abrupt failures remains a critical challenge. Existing\nrobotic manipulation datasets, collected in either simulation or the real\nworld, primarily provide only ground-truth trajectories, leaving robots unable\nto recover once failures occur. Moreover, the few datasets that address failure\ndetection typically offer only textual explanations, which are difficult to\nutilize directly in VLA models. To address this gap, we introduce FailSafe, a\nnovel failure generation and recovery system that automatically produces\ndiverse failure cases paired with executable recovery actions. FailSafe can be\nseamlessly applied to any manipulation task in any simulator, enabling scalable\ncreation of failure-action data. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we fine-tune\nLLaVa-OneVision-7B (LLaVa-OV-7B) to build FailSafe-VLM. Experimental results\nshow that FailSafe-VLM successfully helps robotic arm detect and recover from\npotential failures, improving the performance of three state-of-the-art VLA\nmodels pi0-FAST, OpenVLA, OpenVLA-OFT) by up to 22.6% on average across several\ntasks in Maniskill.

We study when it\nhelps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting\nfailure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We\nfocus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and\ncritic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of\nstrong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work\nshows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites\ninvolve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to\nsharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing\nin cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This\nreveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into\nalgorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues\nbehind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that\ninduce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy\ncoevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model\nvariance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes\nenables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to\noutperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance\npreviously reported in OpenAI Gym.

Knowledge graphs address these challenges\nby structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their\nrelationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective\nuse of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and\nits query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system\nutilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL\nsemantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013).\nWe demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products\nKnowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural\nproducts (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for\nhandling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent\n(Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and\nLangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external\ntools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process\nfollows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the\nquestion is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are\nforwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to\nthe knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent,\nwhich identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized\nidentifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph\nAgent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or\ntaxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent\nresponsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the\nknowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the\nsystem executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph\nand returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance\nof MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected\nanswers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a\nbaseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that\nincorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity\nIDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%,\nunderscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving\nentities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising\nperformance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling\nresearchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language\nqueries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it\nremoves technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge\ngraphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while\nmaintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs\nremain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This\napproach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between\ncomplex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning\n(Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified\nclean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary\ndiscriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective\nto prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding\ncorrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We\nestablish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy\nwith finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from\ndomain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive\nand hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a\nsmaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive\nEstimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our\napproach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to\nout-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather\nthan inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong\nreranking capabilities."}

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions.

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free\ncross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are\ncompletely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the\nissue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant\nanalysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification\nis performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the\nrandom kernel method. Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of\nour approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples\nwith significant margins."}

Based on the practical implementation of the Kant\nsystem, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI\nclusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate\n(SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution\n(JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a\nfoundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from\nhundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such\nas Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves\nresource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing\nresource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training.

Recent studies\nsuggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve\nthe execution accuracy.

This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps,\nwhich in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may\nunknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss\nor trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to\ndiagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment\n(GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the\nground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM)\nmetric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy.\nThis joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i)\nExecution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action\nbut execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but\nreasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results\nacross a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution\ngaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than\nreasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap,\nsizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models.

Agents in TUMIX iteratively\nshare and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In\nexperiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art\ntool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy\nimprovement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and\nGemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference\ncosts. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced\nby using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt\nrefinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only\n49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance,\nalbeit at a greater cost."}

In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically,\nwe question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and\nhence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that\ndraws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then\nboth models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena\ndatasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative\nincrease in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all\nfour rating systems studied.

However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a\npractical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge\nbetween information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing\nefficient deep learning."}

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens.

Here we show the pervasiveness\nand harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First,\nacross 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly\nsycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so\neven in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other\nrelational harms.

Subsequently, we propose a mutual information\n(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific\nvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on\nmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of\ntwo macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies\nneural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual\nfeatures, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and\nintra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of\nstructured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our\nunderstanding of its encoding principles."}

Iran is one of the largest\ncountries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest\ncountry in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy\nconsumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in\ncold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption,\nespecially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This\nstudy aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in\nZanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and\na hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and\nmeteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were\ntrained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption\npatterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model\noutperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean\nSquared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean\nPercentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust\nperformance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest\nthat machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be\neffectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to\nmore efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study\nhighlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in\npredictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across\ndifferent regions."}

This paper\ninvestigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological\ncounseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a\npsychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the\nqualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S.\nNational Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human\ncounselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate\nsufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a\nrole. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in\nU.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional\ncounselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises\napproximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to\nrequire deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of\npsychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's\nability to function as a counselor.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular\nframework for question answering that is powered by two large language models\n(LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database\nthat are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the\nretrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and\ngenerator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on\na new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and\nbenefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning\nstrategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our\nexperiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal\nimprovement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have\nsignificantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal\nfine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes\ncontext labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the\nembedding and generator models is required."}

Training\non such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**,\nwhere models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically\nuninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed\nfailure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the\nturn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that\nour approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical\npre-consultation."}

Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their\nknowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial\nfor factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure\nthis ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by\nrefusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different\nrefusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are\nproxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes\nrather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the\nRefusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs\nrefuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation\nbetween refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically\nmeasurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently\nestimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs.\nExtensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI\naccurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in\nfactual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and\nprovides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy\nand refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but\npreviously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high\naccuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and\nfragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy\nmetrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation."}

To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model.

This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model.

We conduct\nmultiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to\nhurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to\ncompare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random\nforest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24\nto 120 hours).

We also show that allocating more test-time compute to\ngenerating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more\nsolutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in\nguiding meaningful exploration."}

This preclinical\nbenchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with\ninertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a\ntotal of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both\ncommodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy\nsubjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological\ncohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks\n(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA\nBodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using\nOpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17\nkeypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,\nachieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\\deg \\pm 4.80\\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\\deg\n\\pm 4.18\\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \\pm 0.15$)\nand the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \\pm 0.28$). The\nresults reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic\nassessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and\nsensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This\nstudy clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically\npromising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based\nestimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians\nseeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for\ntelehealth and remote patient monitoring."}

In addition to accurate classification, it is essential\nthat detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency\nfor regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce\nVidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a\nmulti-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and\ninsightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and\nAI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully\ndesigning the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then\nfine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target\ntemporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing\nbenchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies\nfurther show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales\nbehind its predictions. The code is publicly available at\nhttps://VidGuard-R1.github.io."}

Beyond their\ncreative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for\nrobotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,\ncurrent approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object\ninteractions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method\ngenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We\npropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion\nsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,\nKineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual\nconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support\nfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that\nKineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.\nAblation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and\nhigh-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made\npublicly available."}

To this end, we make\nthe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each\nphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well\nas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in\na generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though\nbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other\nmodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting."}

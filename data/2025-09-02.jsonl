From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context\nand temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside\nthe simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the\ncommon ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The\nanalysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an\nexact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus\nsampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline\na controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection\nto loop-like, hallucination-style behavior. We make no claims about training\ndynamics or internal representations; those are deferred to future work."}

We introduce\nHealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining\napplications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive\nwrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address\nunfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and\nreport generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that\ndiverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis\nprogression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five\nstate-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its\nfunctionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four\nproof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its\ncapability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation\nusing five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model\nstrengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency\nscores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors.

Attribution patching offers a\nfaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced\nreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse.

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples.

To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding\nGenerative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired\nby the biological wake-sleep cycle.

We employ a dual approach: first, we measure the\n\"steerability\" of two well-known open-source LLMs using instruction prompting\nand activation steering. We find that while some models can easily switch\nbetween liberal and conservative viewpoints, others exhibit resistance or an\nincreased rate of refusal, suggesting a more entrenched ideological structure.\nSecond, we probe the internal mechanisms of these models using Sparse\nAutoencoders (SAEs). Preliminary analysis reveals that models with lower\nsteerability possess more distinct and abstract ideological features. Our\nevaluations reveal that one model can contain 7.3x more political features than\nanother model of similar size.

We propose a latent\ndiffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,\nincluding the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.\nCompleting the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the\nambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem\npartially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,\nreconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the\ninput views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a\ndistribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single\ninput image.

Motivated by two key empirical observations - the\ninherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient\ndescent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in\nwhich curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy\nTailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects\nheavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to\nenhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as\nsharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss\nlandscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide\nbasins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise\ninto an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD\nconsistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like\nMNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It\nultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves\ngeneralization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning\nrate choices."}

In particular, a series of\nremarkable yet often counterintuitive phenomena have been reported in LLMs,\nexhibiting patterns not typically observed in traditional RL settings. For\nexample, notable claims include that a single training example can match the\nperformance achieved with an entire dataset, that the reward signal does not\nneed to be very accurate, and that training solely with negative samples can\nmatch or even surpass sophisticated reward-based methods. However, the precise\nconditions under which these observations hold - and, critically, when they\nfail - remain unclear. In this work, we identify a key factor that\ndifferentiates RL observations: whether the pretrained model already exhibits\nstrong Model-Task Alignment, as measured by pass@k accuracy on the evaluated\ntask. Through a systematic and comprehensive examination of a series of\ncounterintuitive claims, supported by rigorous experimental validation across\ndifferent model architectures and task domains, our findings show that while\nstandard RL training remains consistently robust across settings, many of these\ncounterintuitive results arise only when the model and task already exhibit\nstrong model-task alignment.

The Leibovich\nscore remains widely used for stratifying distant recurrence risk but offers\nlimited patient-level resolution and excludes imaging information. This study\nevaluates multimodal recurrence prediction by integrating preoperative computed\ntomography (CT) and postoperative histopathology whole-slide images (WSIs). A\nmodular deep learning framework with pretrained encoders and Cox-based survival\nmodeling was tested across unimodal, late fusion, and intermediate fusion\nsetups. In a real-world ccRCC cohort, WSI-based models consistently\noutperformed CT-only models, underscoring the prognostic strength of pathology.\nIntermediate fusion further improved performance, with the best model\n(TITAN-CONCH with ResNet-18) approaching the adjusted Leibovich score. Random\ntie-breaking narrowed the gap between the clinical baseline and learned models,\nsuggesting discretization may overstate individualized performance. Using\nsimple embedding concatenation, radiology added value primarily through fusion.\nThese findings demonstrate the feasibility of foundation model-based multimodal\nintegration for personalized ccRCC risk prediction. Future work should explore\nmore expressive fusion strategies, larger multimodal datasets, and\ngeneral-purpose CT encoders to better match pathology modeling capacity."}

Operationalizing this\nprinciple for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data,\nremains a significant challenge.

We propose a\nnovel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and\ninvestigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that\nsubstantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without\nsignificant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically\ndetermined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets,\nchoice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference\ncomplexity).

While forecasting mental health scores alone offers\nlimited insights into the impact of events on community well-being,\nquasi-experimental designs like the Longitudinal Regression Discontinuity\nDesign (LRDD) from econometrics help researchers derive more effects that are\nmore likely to be causal from observational data. LRDDs aim to extrapolate the\nsize of changes in an outcome (e.g. a discontinuity in running scores for\nanxiety) due to a time-specific event.

Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the\nnormal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense\nof the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two\nways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather\nthan exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test\nrequires building machines that \"make mistakes\" and display imperfect behavior\njust like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a\nstatistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a\nsingle \"average\" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As\nsuch, the notion of \"average human interrogator\" that Turing talks about in his\noriginal paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical\nabstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of\nmultiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of\nnormal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average\njudgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First,\nit argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the\nTuring test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than\nnormal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it\nproposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per\nse. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can\ncontribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether\nthe human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which\nlargely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual\nunderpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to."}

While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups.

We draw connections between adjustment and identification\nwith discrete-time versus continuous-time models.

On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D\ncontroller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by\n70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance\nbaselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one\nsampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings,\nrapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding\nexisting benchmarks."}

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach\nachieves more than 3\\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on\ntraditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics."}

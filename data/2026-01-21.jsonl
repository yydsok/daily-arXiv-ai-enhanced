Therefore, the design process often relies heavily on domain expertise and significant human effort. The majority of current methods are rule-based, requiring the specification of a grammar or a set of primitive components and modules that can be composed to create a design. We propose a novel automated robot design framework, RobotDesignGPT, that leverages the general knowledge and reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained vision-language models to automate the robot design synthesis process. Our framework synthesizes an initial robot design from a simple user prompt and a reference image. Our novel visual feedback approach allows us to greatly improve the design quality and reduce unnecessary manual feedback. We demonstrate that our framework can design visually appealing and kinematically valid robots inspired by nature, ranging from legged animals to flying creatures. We justify the proposed framework by conducting an ablation study and a user study."}

A common approach for active orbit control involves the use of multiple thrusters, which, when properly arranged, can also generate the required torque for attitude control. Starting from a 24-thruster configuration, this paper presents a set of thruster configurations (referred to as a viable configuration group) that enable full six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) control. Further, configuration group that requires minimum total thrust to achieve 6-DOF commands are found among the viable configuration group. One configuration from each of these groups is further evaluated for its attitude control performance through a representative rendezvous-docking mission, demonstrating that even with a reduced thruster count, sufficient maneuverability can be achieved."}

When moving obstacles enter a UAV's sensing region, they are modeled as three dimensional doublets or ellipsoids that generate local velocity fields, guiding nearby UAVs to execute smooth, collision-free maneuvers without trajectory discontinuities or explicit trajectory replanning. This flow-based approach enables real-time operation and interpretable behavior by leveraging the nature of fluid flow around obstacles via the harmonic properties of Laplace's equation, inherently avoiding local minima common in traditional potential field methods. To establish and maintain coordination among the UAVs, a Virtual Rigid Body (VRB) formation strategy is integrated, ensuring that formation geometry and trajectory tracking are preserved. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of the method for both individual and multi-UAV scenarios with multiple formation geometries encountering moving obstacles. The proposed approach achieves safe, smooth, and computationally efficient avoidance maneuvers suitable for real-time and practical applications."}

Traditional approaches to vocalisation analysis, relying on manual annotation and predefined categories, introduce biases, limit scalability, and fail to capture the full complexity of vocal repertoires. We introduce a computational framework for the automated detection, acoustic feature extraction, and unsupervised learning of chick vocalisations. Applying this framework to a dataset of newly hatched chicks, we identified two primary vocal clusters. We then tested our computational framework on an independent dataset of chicks exposed during embryonic development to vehicle or Valproic Acid (VPA), a compound that disrupts neural development and is linked to autistic-like symptoms. Clustering analysis on the experimental dataset confirmed two primary vocal clusters and revealed systematic differences between groups. VPA-exposed chicks showed an altered repertoire, with a relative increase in softer calls. VPA differentially affected call clusters, modulating temporal, frequency, and energy domain features. Overall, VPA-exposed chicks produced vocalisations with shorter duration, reduced pitch variability, and modified energy profiles, with the strongest alterations observed in louder calls. This study provides a computational framework for analysing animal vocalisations, advancing knowledge of early-life communication in typical and atypical vocal development."}

Due to their impressive recall abilities, large language models (LLMs) have been recently explored for differential diagnosis. Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score.

Most deployed artificial systems realise their functions via sequential or time-multiplexed updates. Conscious experience appears unified and simultaneous. I show that this difference matters formally. I augment Stack Theory with algebraic laws relating within time-window constraint satisfaction to conjunction. I introduce a precise temporal semantics over windowed trajectories $τ^{Δ,s}$ and prove that existential temporal realisation $\\Diamond_Δ$ does not preserve conjunction. A system can realise all the ingredients of experience across time without ever instantiating the experienced conjunction itself. I then distinguish two postulates. StrongSync requires objective co-instantiation of the grounded conjunction within the window, while WeakSync permits temporal ``smearing''. I formalise concurrency-capacity to measure what is needed to satisfy StrongSync. Finally, I review neurophysiological evidence suggesting that consciousness depends on phase synchrony and effective connectivity, and that loss of consciousness is often associated with its breakdown. This evidence makes WeakSync less plausible. Under StrongSync, software consciousness on strictly sequential substrates is impossible for contents whose grounding requires two or more simultaneous contributors. The more parts from which simultaneous contribution required, the more concurrency capacity is required. The hardware matters. Consciousness attribution therefore requires architectural inspection, not just functional performance."}

T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice."}

Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality. We combine robustness-driven large-batch training with spherical model merging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, and optimize inference via vLLM and FP8 quantization.

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

However, GSE models are prone to hallucination errors, such as phoneme omissions and speaker inconsistency, which conventional error filtering based on non-intrusive speech quality metrics often fails to detect. To address this issue, we propose a non-intrusive method for filtering hallucination errors from discrete token-based GSE models. Our method leverages the log-probabilities of generated tokens as confidence scores to detect potential errors. Experimental results show that the confidence scores strongly correlate with a suite of intrusive SE metrics, and that our method effectively identifies hallucination errors missed by conventional filtering methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our method: curating an in-the-wild TTS dataset with our confidence-based filtering improves the performance of subsequently trained TTS models."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

In stochastic settings, we evaluate output variability and investigate the relationship between consistency and correctness. HuatuoGPT-o1-8B achieved the highest performance. The results show that high consistency across the model response is not an indicator of correctness, although HuatuoGPT-o1-8B showed the highest consistency rate. When tasked with selecting correct reasoning, both HuatuoGPT-o1-8B and Diabetica-o1 exhibit self-assessment bias and dependency on the order of the candidate explanations. Expert review of incorrect reasoning rationales identified a mix of clinically acceptable responses and clinical oversight. We further show that system-level perturbations, such as differences in CUDA builds, can yield statistically significant shifts in model output despite stable accuracy. This work demonstrates that small, semantically negligible prompt perturbations lead to divergent outputs, raising concerns about reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations and highlights the output variability under different stochastic regimes, emphasizing the need of a broader diagnostic framework to understand potential pitfalls in real-world clinical decision support scenarios."}

We demonstrate that the L2 normalization constraint, a characteristic of many LLM architectures, results in a structured embedding space suitable for analysis using a Hamiltonian formalism. We derive relationships between cosine similarity and perturbations of embedding vectors, and explore direct and indirect semantic transitions. Furthermore, we explore a quantum-inspired perspective, deriving an analogue of zero-point energy and discussing potential connections to Koopman-von Neumann mechanics.

SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems."}

To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss.

They excel in performing simple and repetitive unimanual tasks but still face challenges with bimanual manipulation. This difficulty arises from the complexities of coordinating dual arms and handling multi-stage processes. Recent integration of generative models into imitation learning (IL) has made progress in tackling specific challenges. However, few approaches explicitly consider the multi-stage nature of bimanual tasks while also emphasizing the importance of inference speed. In multi-stage tasks, failures or delays at any stage can cascade over time, impacting the success and efficiency of subsequent sub-stages and ultimately hindering overall task performance. In this paper, we propose a novel keypose-conditioned coordination-aware consistency policy tailored for bimanual manipulation. Our framework instantiates hierarchical imitation learning with a high-level keypose predictor and a low-level trajectory generator. The predicted keyposes serve as sub-goals for trajectory generation, indicating targets for individual sub-stages. The trajectory generator is formulated as a consistency model, generating action sequences based on historical observations and predicted keyposes in a single inference step. In particular, we devise an innovative approach for identifying bimanual keyposes, considering both robot-centric action features and task-centric operation styles. Simulation and real-world experiments illustrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of success rates and operational efficiency.

Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others.

We define explanation driftas the epoch-to-epoch change in normalized token attributions on a fixed probe set, and introduce the Reasoning Stabilization Point(RSP), the earliest epoch after which drift remains consistently low. RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

Ten artist-specific verifiers are trained using authenticated sketches from the Metropolitan Museum of Art open-access collection, the Ashmolean Collections Catalogue, the Morgan Library and Museum, the Royal Collection Trust (UK), the Victoria and Albert Museum Collections, and an online catalogue of the Casa Buonarroti collection and evaluated under a biometric-style protocol with genuine and impostor trials.

Across 900 verification decisions (90 genuine and 810 impostor trials), the pooled system achieves a True Acceptance Rate of 83.3% with a False Acceptance Rate of 9.5% at the chosen operating point. Performance varies substantially by artist, with near-zero false acceptance for some verifiers and elevated confusability for others. A pairwise attribution of false accepts indicates structured error pathways consistent with stylistic proximity and shared drawing conventions, whilst also motivating tighter control of digitisation artefacts and threshold calibration. The proposed methodology is designed to complement, rather than replace, connoisseurship by providing reproducible, quantitative evidence suitable for data-scarce settings common in historical sketch attribution."}

We introduce GRADE (Gumbel-softmax Relaxation for Alignment via Differentiable Estimation), a method that replaces high-variance policy gradient estimation with direct backpropagation through a differentiable relaxation of the discrete token sampling process. Using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization with straight-through estimation (GRADE-STE), we enable end-to-end gradient flow from reward signals through generated tokens to model parameters. On sentiment-controlled text generation using the IMDB dataset, GRADE-STE achieves a test reward of 0.763 +- 0.344 compared to PPO's 0.510 +- 0.313 and REINFORCE's 0.617 +- 0.378, representing a 50% relative improvement over PPO.

Our rigorous evaluation with proper train/validation/test splits demonstrates that these improvements generalize to held-out data, with GRADE-STE showing the best generalization characteristics among all methods tested.

Understanding music structure helps both perception and aesthetic education. Music structure incorporates a range of information, the coordination of which forms the melody, just as different military actions cooperate to produce a military strategy. However, there are a few ways for assessing music perception from the perspectives of system operation and information management. In this paper, we explore the similarities between music structure and military strategy while creating the Music Clips Correlation Network (MCCN) based on Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). The inspiration comes from the comparison between a concert conductor's musical score and a military war commander's sand table exercise. Specifically, we create MCCNs for various kinds of war movie soundtracks, then relate military tactics (Sun Tzu's Art of War, etc.) and political institutions to military operations networks. Our primary findings suggest a few similarities, implying that music perception and aesthetic education can be approached from a military strategy and management perspective through this interdisciplinary research.

We address this problem of stylistically improving designs based on natural language instructions. While VLMs have shown initial success in graphic design, their pretrained knowledge on styles is often too general and misaligned with specific domain data. For example, VLMs may associate minimalism with abstract designs, whereas designers emphasize shape and color choices. Our key insight is to leverage design data -- a collection of real-world designs that implicitly capture designer's principles -- to learn design knowledge and guide stylistic improvement. We propose PRISM (PRior-Informed Stylistic Modification) that constructs and applies a design knowledge base through three stages: (1) clustering high-variance designs to capture diversity within a style, (2) summarizing each cluster into actionable design knowledge, and (3) retrieving relevant knowledge during inference to enable style-aware improvement. Experiments on the Crello dataset show that PRISM achieves the highest average rank of 1.49 (closer to 1 is better) over baselines in style alignment.

We observe that the 28-layer Transformer architecture of FreeFlow can be characterized as an Euler discretization scheme for an ODE along the depth axis, where the layer index serves as the discrete time step. Therefore, we distill the number of layers of the FreeFlow model, following the same derivation logic as FreeFlow, and propose SLT (Single-Layer Transformer), which uses a single shared DiT block to approximate the depth-wise feature evolution of the 28-layer teacher. During training, it matches the teacher's intermediate features at several depth patches, fuses those patch-level representations, and simultaneously aligns the teacher's final velocity prediction. Through distillation training, we compress the 28 independent Transformer Blocks of the teacher model DiT-XL/2 into a single Transformer Block, reducing the parameter count from 675M to 4.3M. Furthermore, leveraging its minimal parameters and rapid sampling speed, SLT can screen more candidate points in the noise space within the same timeframe, thereby selecting higher-quality initial points for the teacher model FreeFlow and ultimately enhancing the quality of generated images. Experimental results demonstrate that within a time budget comparable to two random samplings of the teacher model, our method performs over 100 noise screenings and produces a high-quality sample through the teacher model using the selected points. Quality fluctuations caused by low-quality initial noise under a limited number of FreeFlow sampling calls are effectively avoided, substantially improving the stability and average generation quality of one-step generation."}

We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six.

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies.

Resisting screen-shooting attacks typically requires high-strength watermark embedding, inevitably degrading the cover image. To resolve the robustness-fidelity conflict, non-intrusive watermarking has emerged as a solution by constructing logical verification keys without altering the original content. However, existing non-intrusive schemes lack the capacity to withstand screen-shooting noise. While deep learning offers a potential remedy, we observe that directly applying it leads to a previously underexplored failure mode, the Structural Shortcut: networks tend to learn trivial identity mappings and neglect the image-watermark binding. Furthermore, even when logical binding is enforced, standard training strategies cannot fully bridge the noise gap, yielding suboptimal robustness against physical distortions. In this paper, we propose NiMark, an end-to-end framework addressing these challenges. First, to eliminate the structural shortcut, we introduce the Sigmoid-Gated XOR (SG-XOR) estimator to enable gradient propagation for the logical operation, effectively enforcing rigid image-watermark binding. Second, to overcome the robustness bottleneck, we devise a two-stage training strategy integrating a restorer to bridge the domain gap caused by screen-shooting noise. Experiments demonstrate that NiMark consistently outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods against both digital attacks and screen-shooting noise, while maintaining zero visual distortion."}

Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints. This CBF formulation is fully compatible with the learned AttNP controller and generalizes across a wide range of racing scenarios, providing a lightweight and certifiable safety layer. Our results demonstrate competitive closed-loop performance while ensuring real-time constraint satisfaction."}

RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines.

CCPO introduces Coordinate-Aware Spatial Compression (CASC), which aggregates coordinates from multiple rollouts to capture target-relevant regions and progressively narrow historical attention around key visual areas. From interactions across rollouts, CASC adaptively constructs attention boundaries that concentrate computation on the most informative regions of the scene. We further design a Distance-Based Advantage that provides fine-grained learning signals based on distance rather than binary correctness, improving both grounding accuracy and compression quality.

However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance.

As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech."}

Moore", "Easop Lee", "Boyuan Chen"], "title": "Learning Legged MPC with Smooth Neural Surrogates", "categories": ["cs.RO"], "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning and model predictive control (MPC) can play complementary roles in legged robotics. However, integrating learned models with online planning remains challenging. When dynamics are learned with neural networks, three key difficulties arise: (1) stiff transitions from contact events may be inherited from the data; (2) additional non-physical local nonsmoothness can occur; and (3) training datasets can induce non-Gaussian model errors due to rapid state changes. We address (1) and (2) by introducing the smooth neural surrogate, a neural network with tunable smoothness designed to provide informative predictions and derivatives for trajectory optimization through contact. To address (3), we train these models using a heavy-tailed likelihood that better matches the empirical error distributions observed in legged-robot dynamics. Together, these design choices substantially improve the reliability, scalability, and generalizability of learned legged MPC. Across zero-shot locomotion tasks of increasing difficulty, smooth neural surrogates with robust learning yield consistent reductions in cumulative cost on simple, well-conditioned behaviors (typically 10-50%), while providing substantially larger gains in regimes where standard neural dynamics often fail outright. In these regimes, smoothing enables reliable execution (from 0/5 to 5/5 success) and produces about 2-50x lower cumulative cost, reflecting orders-of-magnitude absolute improvements in robustness rather than incremental performance gains."}

To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization.

Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances.

In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation.

Contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) has emerged as a key technique for generalisable emotion recognition. However, as conventional CLAP enforces a strict one-to-one alignment between paired audio-text samples, it overlooks intra-modal similarity and treats all non-matching pairs as equally negative. This conflicts with the fuzzy boundaries between different emotions. To address this limitation, we propose SmoothCLAP, which introduces softened targets derived from intra-modal similarity and paralinguistic features. By combining these softened targets with conventional contrastive supervision, SmoothCLAP learns embeddings that respect graded emotional relationships, while retaining the same inference pipeline as CLAP. Experiments on eight affective computing tasks across English and German demonstrate that SmoothCLAP is consistently achieving superior performance. Our results highlight that leveraging soft supervision is a promising strategy for building emotion-aware audio-text models."}

However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment."}

Existing benchmarks mainly rely on outcome-oriented accuracy, lacking the capability to assess whether models can accurately leverage fine-grained visual cues for multi-step reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose ViEBench, a process-verifiable benchmark designed to evaluate faithful visual reasoning. Comprising 200 multi-scenario high-resolution images with expert-annotated visual evidence, ViEBench uniquely categorizes tasks by difficulty into perception and reasoning dimensions, where reasoning tasks require utilizing localized visual details with prior knowledge. To establish comprehensive evaluation criteria, we introduce a dual-axis matrix that provides fine-grained metrics through four diagnostic quadrants, enabling transparent diagnosis of model behavior across varying task complexities. Our experiments yield several interesting observations: (1) VLMs can sometimes produce correct final answers despite grounding on irrelevant regions, and (2) they may successfully locate the correct evidence but still fail to utilize it to reach accurate conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that ViEBench can serve as a more explainable and practical benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness agentic VLMs. The codes will be released at: https://github.com/Xuchen-Li/ViEBench."}

Using ubiquitous sensors such as Passive InfraRed sensors (PIR) and door sensors is drawing increasing interest for monitoring daily activities and facilitating preventative healthcare interventions for the elderly. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from passive sensors mostly relies on traditional machine learning and includes data segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. While techniques like Sensor Weighting Mutual Information (SWMI) capture spatial context in a feature vector, effectively leveraging temporal information remains a challenge. We tackle this by clustering activities into morning, afternoon, and night, and encoding them into the feature weighting method calculating distinct mutual information matrices. We further propose to extend the feature vector by incorporating time of day and day of week as cyclical temporal features, as well as adding a feature to track the user's location. The experiments show improved accuracy and F1-score over existing state-of-the-art methods in three out of four real-world datasets, with highest gains in a low-data regime. These results highlight the potential of our approach for developing effective smart home solutions to support ageing in place."}

This paper proposes a song-oriented aesthetics evaluation framework, featuring two novel modules: 1) Multi-Stem Attention Fusion (MSAF) builds bidirectional cross-attention between mixture-vocal and mixture-accompaniment pairs, fusing them to capture complex musical features; 2) Hierarchical Granularity-Aware Interval Aggregation (HiGIA) learns multi-granularity score probability distributions, aggregates them into a score interval, and applies a regression within the interval to produce the final score.

While the current trend is to use learning-based approaches to replace traditional geometry-based methods, existing end-to-end learning-based policies often struggle with 3D spatial reasoning and lack a comprehensive understanding of physical world dynamics. Integrating world models-which predict future observations conditioned on given actions-with iterative optimization planning offers a promising solution due to their capacity for imagination and flexibility. However, current navigation world models, typically built on pure transformer architectures, often rely on multi-step diffusion processes and autoregressive frame-by-frame generation. These mechanisms result in prohibitive computational latency, rendering real-time deployment impossible. To address this bottleneck, we propose a lightweight navigation world model that adopts a one-step generation paradigm and a 3D U-Net backbone equipped with efficient spatial-temporal attention. This design drastically reduces inference latency, enabling high-frequency control while achieving superior predictive performance. We also integrate this model into an optimization-based planning framework utilizing anchor-based initialization to handle multi-modal goal navigation tasks.

However, traditional human-driven discovery of emerging issues is too slow, which leads to delayed updates of annotation policies and poses a major challenge for effective content governance. In this work, we propose an automatic issue discovery method based on multimodal LLM agents. Our approach automatically recalls short videos containing potential new issues and applies a two-stage clustering strategy to group them, with each cluster corresponding to a newly discovered issue. The agent then generates updated annotation policies from these clusters, thereby extending coverage to these emerging issues. Our agent has been deployed in the real system. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate that this agent-based method significantly improves the effectiveness of emerging-issue discovery (with an F1 score improvement of over 20%) and enhances the performance of subsequent issue governance (reducing the view count of problematic videos by approximately 15%). More importantly, compared to manual issue discovery, it greatly reduces time costs and substantially accelerates the iteration of annotation policies."}

Machine learning (ML) models can improve diabetes management by predicting hypoglycemia and providing optimal prevention methods. ML models are classified into regression and classification based, that forecast glucose levels and identify events based on defined labels, respectively. This review investigates state-of-the-art models trained on data of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices from patients with T1D.

As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents."}

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD. Experiments show that ATOD-Eval enables comprehensive assessment across task completion, agentic capability, and response quality, and that the proposed evaluator offers a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to existing memory- and LLM-based approaches under this evaluation setting."}

Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices. This separates invariant structure from modeling choice, enabling principled comparison and extension of attention mechanisms, and attention-based architectures."}

Specifically, we develop the underlying theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms, for finite- and infinite-horizon objectives in both zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings, the latter based on (social-welfare optimal) Nash equilibria. We build an implementation in the PRISM-games model checker and demonstrate the feasibility of robust verification of ICSGs across a selection of large benchmarks."}

In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance.

VoxelMap and its variants typically fit and check planes using all points in a voxel, which may lead to plane parameter deviation caused by outliers, over segmentation of large planes, and incorrect merging across different physical planes. To address these issues, R-VoxelMap utilizes a geometry-driven recursive construction strategy based on an outlier detect-and-reuse pipeline. Specifically, for each voxel, accurate planes are first fitted while separating outliers using random sample consensus (RANSAC). The remaining outliers are then propagated to deeper octree levels for recursive processing, ensuring a detailed representation of the environment. In addition, a point distribution-based validity check algorithm is devised to prevent erroneous plane merging. Extensive experiments on diverse open-source LiDAR(-inertial) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) datasets validate that our method achieves higher accuracy than other state-of-the-art approaches, with comparable efficiency and memory usage.

This increased training/inference cost paved the way for efficient model size reduction/parametric reduction deploying Sparse Attention techniques. In this paper, we start analyzing one of the techniques of Sparse Attention called Symmetric Dot-Product Attention (referred to as Symmetric Attention) and propose a novel unified model architecture called Noise Diffused Symmetric Attention Transformer to enhance the model's performance.

The participant sees an expressive virtual robot that interacts face-to-face in a shared virtual environment. In real time, the robot's upper-body gestures, head and gaze behaviors, and facial expressions are mapped from the operator's tracked motion and face signals. Because the operator is physically co-present and calibrated into the same coordinate frame, the operator can also physically touch the participant, enabling the participant to perceive robot touch aligned with the robot's hands; finger and hand motion are mapped to the robot using inverse kinematics to support precise contact. Beyond faithful motion retargeting for limb teleoperation, our VR2VR system supports experimental control by retargeting or selectively enabling nonverbal channels (e.g., head only vs. head+eyes vs. head+eyes+facial expressions) while keeping physical interaction constant.

Second, an online block masking strategy dynamically applies these predicted masks while maintaining historical sparsity information, eliminating the need for repetitive sampling operations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate consistent acceleration and quality improvements across multiple benchmarks and model architectures, validating MOD-DiT's effectiveness for efficient, high-quality video generation while overcoming the computational limitations of traditional sparse attention approaches."}

However, rigorously quantifying how well a PINN captures the complete dynamical behavior of the system, beyond simple trajectory prediction, remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel experimental framework to address this by employing Fisher information for differentiable dynamical systems, denoted $g_F^C$. This Fisher information, distinct from its statistical counterpart, measures inherent uncertainties in deterministic systems, such as sensitivity to initial conditions, and is related to the phase space curvature and the net stretching action of the state space evolution. We hypothesize that if a PINN accurately learns the underlying dynamics of a physical system, then the Fisher information landscape derived from the PINN's learned equations of motion will closely match that of the original analytical model. This match would signify that the PINN has achieved comprehensive fidelity capturing not only the state evolution but also crucial geometric and stability properties. We outline an experimental methodology using the dynamical model of a car to compute and compare $g_F^C$ for both the analytical model and a trained PINN. The comparison, based on the Jacobians of the respective system dynamics, provides a quantitative measure of the PINN's fidelity in representing the system's intricate dynamical characteristics."}

This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate.

In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia.

While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives."}

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $Σ_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items."}

For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts.

Their success hinges on directly manipulating the angle between features and class prototypes. However, this manipulation relies on the arccos function to recover the angle, introducing a significant yet overlooked source of training instability. The derivative of arccos explodes at its boundaries, causing gradient peaks during optimisation. Furthermore, the formulation fails to generate a sufficiently sharp gradient for hard-to-classify examples. We address these issues by proposing ChebyAAM, a loss that replaces the arccos operation with its Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This substitution eliminates gradient explosion and applies a stronger corrective signal to hard examples, leading to more effective optimisation. Experiments on three benchmarks (VoxCeleb, SITW, and CN-Celeb) demonstrate that our method resolves the instability and consistently improves performance.

Previous version with human-AI collaboration: arXiv:2410.14640", "summary": "We introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates algorithmic recourse, contextual bandits, and large language models (LLMs) to support sequential decision-making in high-stakes settings such as personalized medicine. We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms. Experiments on synthetic environments and a real hypertension-management case study confirm that GLRB and LIBRA improve regret, treatment quality, and sample efficiency compared with standard contextual bandits and LLM-only benchmarks. Our results highlight the promise of recourse-aware, LLM-assisted bandit algorithms for trustworthy LLM-bandits collaboration in personalized high-stakes decision-making."}

Across Burgers' equation, Navier-Stokes, and reactive flows, D-PARC achieves superior fidelity compared to substantially larger architectures. Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics. This demonstrates that physically intuitive architectural design can outperform parameter scaling, establishing that strategic learning in lean networks offers a more effective path forward for PADL than indiscriminate network expansion."}

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

FutureOmni is constructed via a scalable LLM-assisted, human-in-the-loop pipeline and contains 919 videos and 1,034 multiple-choice QA pairs across 8 primary domains. Evaluations on 13 omni-modal and 7 video-only models show that current systems struggle with audio-visual future prediction, particularly in speech-heavy scenarios, with the best accuracy of 64.8% achieved by Gemini 3 Flash. To mitigate this limitation, we curate a 7K-sample instruction-tuning dataset and propose an Omni-Modal Future Forecasting (OFF) training strategy. Evaluations on FutureOmni and popular audio-visual and video-only benchmarks demonstrate that OFF enhances future forecasting and generalization. We publicly release all code (https://github.com/OpenMOSS/FutureOmni) and datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenMOSS-Team/FutureOmni)."}

By lifting measurements into a feature space where they are linear in the state, KILO-EKF enables flexible modeling of complex or poorly calibrated sensors while retaining the structure and efficiency of recursive filtering. The resulting linear-Gaussian measurement model is learned in closed form from groundtruth training data, without iterative optimization or reliance on an explicit parametric sensor model. At inference, KILO-EKF performs a standard EKF update using Jacobians obtained via the learned lifting. We validate the approach on a real-world quadrotor localization task using an IMU, ultra-wideband (UWB) sensors, and a downward-facing laser. We compare against multiple EKF baselines with varying levels of sensor calibration. KILO-EKF achieves better accuracy and consistency compared to data-calibrated baselines, and significantly outperforms EKFs that rely on imperfect geometric models, while maintaining real-time inference and fast training. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Koopman-inspired measurement learning as a scalable alternative to traditional model-based calibration."}

We propose a learning-free, physics-informed inpainting frontend based on reverse time migration (RTM). In this approach, observed multichannel spectrograms are first back-propagated on a 3D grid using an analytic Green's function to form a scene-consistent image, and then forward-projected to reconstruct inpainted signals before log-mel feature extraction and Transformer-based classification. We evaluate the method on ESC-50 with 50 sensors and three layouts (circular, linear, right-angle), where per-channel SNRs are sampled from -30 to 0 dB. Compared with an AST baseline, scaling-sparsemax channel selection, and channel-swap augmentation, the proposed RTM frontend achieves the best or competitive accuracy across all layouts, improving accuracy by 13.1 points on the right-angle layout (from 9.7% to 22.8%). Correlation analyses show that spatial weights align more strongly with SNR than with channel--source distance, and that higher SNR--weight correlation corresponds to higher SEC accuracy.

On a curated subset of DAPO-MATH, 89\\% of failures exhibit such traps. To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix.

However, it is significantly impeded by challenges such as the coexistence of densely packed and sparsely distributed cells, complex overlapping morphologies, and severe class imbalance. Conventional deep learning models often fail to preserve fine topological details or accurately delineate boundaries under these conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, IMSAHLO (Integrating Multi-Scale Attention and Hybrid Loss Optimization), for robust and adaptive neuronal segmentation. The core of our model features Multi-Scale Dense Blocks (MSDBs) to capture features at various receptive fields, effectively handling variations in cell density, and a Hierarchical Attention (HA) mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient morphological features to preserve Region of Interest (ROI) boundary details. Furthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid loss function synergistically combining Tversky and Focal loss to combat class imbalance, alongside a topology-aware Centerline Dice (clDice) loss and a Contour-Weighted Boundary loss to ensure topological continuity and precise separation of adjacent cells. Large-scale experiments on the public Fluorescent Neuronal Cells (FNC) dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art architectures, achieving precision of 81.4%, macro F1 score of 82.7%, micro F1 score of 83.3%, and balanced accuracy of 99.5% on difficult dense and sparse cases. Ablation studies validate the synergistic benefits of multi-scale attention and hybrid loss terms.

In this study, we present a machine learning (ML) framework capable of accurately predicting the wettability of laser-textured metal alloys using experimentally derived morphological and chemical features. Superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic surfaces were fabricated on AA6061 and AISI 4130 alloys via nanosecond laser texturing followed by chemical immersion treatments. Surface morphology was quantified using the Laws texture energy method and profilometry, while surface chemistry was characterized through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), extracting features such as functional group polarity, molecular volume, and peak area fraction. These features were used to train an ensemble neural network model incorporating residual connections, batch normalization, and dropout regularization. The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.942, RMSE = 13.896), outperforming previous approaches. Feature importance analysis revealed that surface chemistry had the strongest influence on contact angle prediction, with topographical features also contributing significantly. This work demonstrates the potential of artificial intelligence to model and predict wetting behavior by capturing the complex interplay of surface characteristics, offering a data-driven pathway for designing tailored functional surfaces."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on opaque visual embeddings -- high-dimensional feature vectors extracted from images -- the proposed method uses human-readable language to represent observations. Each robot locally detects and describes individuals using a vision-language model (VLM), producing textual descriptions of appearance instead of feature vectors. These descriptions are compared and clustered across the swarm without centralized coordination, allowing robots to collaboratively group observations of the same individual. Each cluster is distilled into a representative description by a language model, providing an interpretable, concise summary of the swarm's collective perception. This approach enables natural-language querying, enhances transparency, and supports explainable swarm behavior. Preliminary experiments demonstrate competitive performance in identity consistency and interpretability compared to embedding-based methods, despite current limitations in text similarity and computational load. Ongoing work explores refined similarity metrics, semantic navigation, and the extension of language-based perception to environmental elements. This work prioritizes decentralized perception and communication, while active navigation remains an open direction for future study."}

To address this, we propose Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement (MARS), a framework that achieves efficient self-evolution within a single recurrence cycle. Inspired by educational psychology, MARS mimics human learning by integrating principle-based reflection (abstracting normative rules to avoid errors) and procedural reflection (deriving step-by-step strategies for success). By synthesizing these insights into optimized instructions, MARS allows agents to systematically refine their reasoning logic without continuous online feedback. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MARS outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving systems while significantly reducing computational overhead."}

Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism.

However, current detoxification techniques rarely exploit these built-in abilities; instead, they rely on external modules, labor-intensive data annotation, or human intervention --factors that hinder scalability and consistency. In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart. This iterative procedure yields a contrastive detoxification dataset used to fine-tune the model, enhancing its ability for safe and coherent text generation. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as DetoxLLM and ParaDetox show that our method achieves better detoxification performance than state-of-the-art methods while preserving semantic fidelity. By obviating the need for human intervention or external components, this paper reveals the intrinsic self-detoxification ability of LLMs, offering a consistent and effective approach for mitigating harmful content generation. Ultimately, our findings underscore the potential for truly self-regulated language models, paving the way for more responsible and ethically guided text generation systems."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

This state, implemented as a structured system-prompt summary, is updated at each timestep via feedback-driven text rewrites, enabling learning without parameter updates. Under a fixed token budget, LLM-as-RNN corrects errors and retains task-relevant patterns, effectively performing online learning through language. We evaluate the method on three sequential benchmarks in healthcare, meteorology, and finance across Llama, Gemma, and GPT model families.

However, achieving reliable navigation remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on artificial muscles integrated into the robot body or active tip-steering mechanisms. While effective, these additions introduce structural complexity and compromise the defining advantages of eversion robots: their inherent softness and compliance. In this paper, we propose a passive approach to reduce bending stiffness by purposefully introducing buckling points along the robot's outer wall. We achieve this by integrating inextensible diameter-reducing circumferential bands at regular intervals along the robot body facilitating forward motion through tortuous, obstacle cluttered paths. Rather than relying on active steering, our approach leverages the robot's natural interaction with the environment, allowing for smooth, compliant navigation. We present a Cosserat rod-based mathematical model to quantify this behavior, capturing the local stiffness reductions caused by the constricting bands and their impact on global bending mechanics. Experimental results demonstrate that these bands reduce the robot's stiffness when bent at the tip by up to 91 percent, enabling consistent traversal of 180 degree bends with a bending radius of as low as 25 mm-notably lower than the 35 mm achievable by standard eversion robots under identical conditions. The feasibility of the proposed method is further demonstrated through a case study in a colon phantom. By significantly improving maneuverability without sacrificing softness or increasing mechanical complexity, this approach expands the applicability of eversion robots in highly curved pathways, whether in relation to pipe inspection or medical procedures such as colonoscopy."}

These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs, sensitivity to user interactions, and degraded performance when the foreground and background share similar color distributions.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pixel Segment Similarity Index (PSSI), which leverages the harmonic mean of inter-channel similarities by incorporating both pixel intensity and spatial smoothness features. The harmonic mean effectively penalizes dissimilarities in any individual channel, enhancing robustness. The computational complexity of PSSI is $\\mathcal{O}(B)$, where $B$ denotes the number of histogram bins. Our segmentation framework begins with low-level segmentation using MeanShift, which effectively captures color, texture, and segment shape. Based on the resulting pixel segments, we construct a pixel-segment graph with edge weights determined by PSSI. For partitioning, we employ the Maximum Spanning Tree (MaxST), which captures strongly connected local neighborhoods beneficial for precise segmentation. The integration of the proposed PSSI, MeanShift, and MaxST allows our method to jointly capture color similarity, smoothness, texture, shape, and strong local connectivity. Experimental evaluations on the GrabCut and Images250 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms current graph-based interactive segmentation methods such as AMOE, OneCut, and SSNCut in terms of segmentation quality, as measured by Jaccard Index (IoU), $F_1$ score, execution time and Mean Error (ME).

We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87).

Translation quality, thus emerges as a strong, inexpensive first-pass proxy of multilingual performance, enabling a translation-first screening with targeted follow-up for specific tasks."}

Linear attention mechanisms offer linear or near-linear scaling yet often incur performance degradation. Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures Large Language Models (LLMs) not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

This paper studies a variant, HPP with Probabilistic Terminals (HPP-PT), where each vertex has a probability representing the likelihood that the robot's path terminates there, and the objective is to minimize the expected path cost. HPP-PT arises in target object search, where a mobile robot must visit all candidate locations to find an object, and prior knowledge of the object's location is expressed as vertex probabilities. While routing problems have been studied for decades, few of them consider uncertainty as required in this work. The challenge lies not only in optimally ordering the vertices, as in standard HPP, but also in handling history dependency: the expected path cost depends on the order in which vertices were previously visited. This makes many existing methods inefficient or inapplicable. To address the challenge, we propose a search-based approach RPT* with solution optimality guarantees, which leverages dynamic programming in a new state space to bypass the history dependency and novel heuristics to speed up the computation. Building on RPT*, we design a Hierarchical Autonomous Target Search (HATS) system that combines RPT* with either Bayesian filtering for lifelong target search with noisy sensors, or autonomous exploration to find targets in unknown environments. Experiments in both simulation and real robot show that our approach can naturally balance between exploitation and exploration, thereby finding targets more quickly on average than baseline methods."}

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net."}

However, NTP operates at the \\textit{token} level, treating deviations from a single reference continuation as errors even when alternative continuations are equally plausible or semantically equivalent (e.g., ``mom'' vs. ``mother''). As a result, token-level loss can penalize valid abstractions, paraphrases, or conceptually correct reasoning paths, biasing models toward surface form rather than underlying meaning. This mismatch between the training signal and semantic correctness motivates learning objectives that operate over higher-level representations. We propose a shift from token-level to concept-level prediction, where concepts group multiple surface forms of the same idea (e.g., ``mom,'' ``mommy,'' ``mother'' $\\rightarrow$ \\textit{MOTHER}). We introduce various methods for integrating conceptual supervision into LLM training and show that concept-aware models achieve lower perplexity, improved robustness under domain shift, and stronger performance than NTP-based models on diverse NLP benchmarks.

IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol. Extensive empirical results validate the superior performance of our proposed method across multiple few-shot classification tasks."}

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

They also lack a unified mechanism to balance semantic guidance with motion efficiency in large-scale environments. To address these challenges, we present AirHunt, an aerial object navigation system that efficiently locates open-set objects with zero-shot generalization in outdoor environments by seamlessly fusing VLM semantic reasoning with continuous path planning. AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments further validate AirHunt's practical capability in complex and challenging environments. Code and dataset will be made publicly available before publication."}

While recent benchmarks have focused on evaluating the structural correctness of such outputs, the environmental impact of inference for different output formats has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we argue that structured output formats should be assessed not only in terms of correctness, but also with respect to their environmental efficiency. To this end, we introduce a sustainability-aware evaluation framework for structured generation that measures token usage, generation time, and estimated carbon emissions. Within this framework, we propose the Environment-Aware Generation Correctness Score (GCS_env), a unified metric that integrates structural correctness with carbon-aware efficiency. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark the novel TOON format against established representations (JSON, XML, YAML) across multiple LLMs spanning different architectures and parameter scales.\n  Our results reveal a consistent trade-off: TOON yields markedly more compact outputs and lower emissions, but lower structural correctness when models lack native support. We show that increased model capacity reduces this gap and that environment-aware scoring can shift format rankings depending on deployment priorities. highlighting the need for sustainability-inclusive benchmarking and provides empirical evidence that compact representations such as TOON can offer practical advantages in large-scale, carbon-conscious LLM deployments."}

This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults).

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove.

We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%).

Explicit system identification, which tunes explicit simulator parameters, is often insufficient to align the intricate, high-dimensional, and state-dependent dynamics of the real world. To overcome this, we propose an implicit sim-to-real alignment framework that learns to directly align the simulator's dynamics with contact information. Our method treats the off-the-shelf simulator as a base prior and learns a contact-aware neural dynamics model to refine simulated states using real-world observations. We show that using tactile contact information from robotic hands can effectively model the non-smooth discontinuities inherent in contact-rich tasks, resulting in a neural dynamics model grounded by real-world data. We demonstrate that this learned forward dynamics model improves state prediction accuracy and can be effectively used to predict policy performance and refine policies trained purely in standard simulators, offering a scalable, data-driven approach to sim-to-real alignment."}

Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that SNR and its variants are not always highly correlated with human perception, prompting us to raise the questions: Why does SNR fail in measuring audio quality? And how to improve its reliability as an objective metric? In this paper, we identify the inadequate measurement of phase distance as a pivotal factor and propose to reformulate SNR with specially designed phase-distance terms, yielding an improved metric named GOMPSNR. We further extend the newly proposed formulation to derive two novel categories of loss function, corresponding to magnitude-guided phase refinement and joint magnitude-phase optimization, respectively. Besides, extensive experiments are conducted for an optimal combination of different loss functions. Experimental results on advanced neural vocoders demonstrate that our proposed GOMPSNR exhibits more reliable error measurement than SNR.

Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct."}

We observe that pre-training on unlabeled jets leads to emergent semantic class clustering in the representation space.

To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots. Results demonstrate superior performance on the HumanML3D-X benchmark for human whole-body motion generation, and our introduced reinforcement learning fine-tuning consistently improves both motion tracking accuracy and task success rates of these humanoid robots.

To address these issues, we propose EAI-ADD, which treats cross level emotion acoustic inconsistency as the primary detection signal. We first project emotional and acoustic representations into a comparable space. Then we progressively integrate frame level and utterance level emotion features with acoustic features to capture cross level emotion acoustic inconsistencies across different temporal granularities. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019LA and 2021LA datasets demonstrate that the proposed EAI-ADD outperforms baselines, providing a more effective solution for audio anti spoofing detection."}

While this level of abstraction has enabled a rich body of results, it limits the ability to represent structural dependencies that are central in many structured argumentation formalisms, in particular subargument relations. Existing extensions, including bipolar argumentation frameworks, introduce support relations, but these do not capture the asymmetric and constitutive nature of subarguments or their interaction with attacks. In this paper, we study abstract argumentation frameworks enriched with an explicit subargument relation, treated alongside attack as a basic relation. We analyse how subargument relations interact with attacks and examine their impact on fundamental semantic properties. This framework provides a principled abstraction of structural information and clarifies the role of subarguments in abstract acceptability reasoning."}

In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. \"foveated\") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a \"same\" or \"different\" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions."}

The incompatibility of tokenization schemes between teacher and student models has largely prevented fine-grained, white-box distillation of preference information. To address this gap, we propose Cross-Tokenizer Preference Distillation (CTPD), the first unified framework for transferring human-aligned behavior between models with heterogeneous tokenizers. CTPD introduces three key innovations: (1) Aligned Span Projection, which maps teacher and student tokens to shared character-level spans for precise supervision transfer; (2) a cross-tokenizer adaptation of Token-level Importance Sampling (TIS-DPO) for improved credit assignment; and (3) a Teacher-Anchored Reference, allowing the student to directly leverage the teacher's preferences in a DPO-style objective. Our theoretical analysis grounds CTPD in importance sampling, and experiments across multiple benchmarks confirm its effectiveness, with significant performance gains over existing methods. These results establish CTPD as a practical and general solution for preference distillation across diverse tokenization schemes, opening the door to more accessible and efficient alignment of language models."}

This phenomenon describes the behavior of gradient alignment in SGD updates. Specifically, during the initial phase of SGD updates, the alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace tends to decrease. Subsequently, it enters a rising phase and eventually stabilizes in a high-alignment phase. The alignment is considered ``suspicious'' because, paradoxically, the projected gradient update along this highly-aligned dominant subspace proves ineffective at reducing the loss. The focus of this work is to give a fine-grained analysis in a high-dimensional quadratic setup about how step size selection produces this phenomenon. Our main contribution can be summarized as follows: We propose a step-size condition revealing that in low-alignment regimes, an adaptive critical step size $η_t^*$ separates alignment-decreasing ($η_t < η_t^*$) from alignment-increasing ($η_t > η_t^*$) regimes, whereas in high-alignment regimes, the alignment is self-correcting and decreases regardless of the step size. We further show that under sufficient ill-conditioning, a step size interval exists where projecting the SGD updates to the bulk space decreases the loss while projecting them to the dominant space increases the loss, which explains a recent empirical observation that projecting gradient updates to the dominant subspace is ineffective. Finally, based on this adaptive step-size theory, we prove that for a constant step size and large initialization, SGD exhibits this distinct two-phase behavior: an initial alignment-decreasing phase, followed by stabilization at high alignment."}

Furthermore, SAG introduces a one-for-all reusing strategy that reuses activations across both timesteps and blocks in a zig-zag manner, minimizing the global redundancy.

Recent works incorporate reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance the robustness of diffusion planners through reward-oriented optimization in a generation-evaluation loop. However, they struggle to generate multi-modal, scenario-adaptive trajectories, hindering the exploitation efficiency of informative rewards during fine-tuning. To resolve this, we propose PlannerRFT, a sample-efficient reinforcement fine-tuning framework for diffusion-based planners. PlannerRFT adopts a dual-branch optimization that simultaneously refines the trajectory distribution and adaptively guides the denoising process toward more promising exploration, without altering the original inference pipeline. To support parallel learning at scale, we develop nuMax, an optimized simulator that achieves 10 times faster rollout compared to native nuPlan. Extensive experiments shows that PlannerRFT yields state-of-the-art performance with distinct behaviors emerging during the learning process."}

Yet most existing models learn topics in disjoint, language-specific spaces and rely on alignment mechanisms (e.g., bilingual dictionaries) that often fail to capture deep cross-lingual semantics, resulting in loosely connected topic spaces. Moreover, these approaches often overlook the rich semantic signals embedded in multilingual pretrained representations, further limiting their ability to capture fine-grained alignment. We introduce GloCTM (Global Context Space for Cross-Lingual Topic Model), a novel framework that enforces cross-lingual topic alignment through a unified semantic space spanning the entire model pipeline. GloCTM constructs enriched input representations by expanding bag-of-words with cross-lingual lexical neighborhoods, and infers topic proportions using both local and global encoders, with their latent representations aligned through internal regularization. At the output level, the global topic-word distribution, defined over the combined vocabulary, structurally synchronizes topic meanings across languages. To further ground topics in deep semantic space, GloCTM incorporates a Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) loss that aligns the latent topic space with multilingual contextual embeddings. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GloCTM significantly improves topic coherence and cross-lingual alignment, outperforming strong baselines."}

In this paper, we propose a selective forecasting framework to identify these critical segments of time series using shapelets. We learn shapelets using shift-invariant dictionary learning on the validation split of the target domain dataset. Utilizing distance-based similarity to these shapelets, we facilitate the user to selectively discard unreliable predictions and be informed of the model's realistic capabilities.

But what happens if the context does not align with model priors or safety protocols? In this paper, we investigate how LLMs behave and reason when presented with counterfactual or even adversarial medical evidence. We first construct MedCounterFact, a counterfactual medical QA dataset that requires the models to answer clinical comparison questions (i.e., judge the efficacy of certain treatments, with evidence consisting of randomized controlled trials provided as context). In MedCounterFact, real-world medical interventions within the questions and evidence are systematically replaced with four types of counterfactual stimuli, ranging from unknown words to toxic substances. Our evaluation across multiple frontier LLMs on MedCounterFact reveals that in the presence of counterfactual evidence, existing models overwhelmingly accept such \"evidence\" at face value even when it is dangerous or implausible, and provide confident and uncaveated answers. While it may be prudent to draw a boundary between faithfulness and safety, our findings reveal that there exists no such boundary yet."}

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks."}

Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf ) provides a robust formalism for encoding these temporal goals. Traditional LTLf task planning approaches often transform the temporal planning problem into a classical planning problem with reachability goals, which are then solved using off-the-shelf planners. However, these methods often lack informed heuristics to provide a guided search for temporal goals. We introduce TIDE (Trace-Informed Depth-first Exploration), a novel approach that addresses this limitation by decomposing a temporal problem into a sequence of smaller, manageable reach-avoid sub-problems, each solvable using an off-the-shelf planner. TIDE identifies and prioritizes promising automaton traces within the domain graph, using cost-driven heuristics to guide exploration. Its adaptive backtracking mechanism systematically recovers from failed plans by recalculating costs and penalizing infeasible transitions, ensuring completeness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that TIDE achieves promising performance and is a valuable addition to the portfolio of planning methods for temporally extended goals."}

To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models."}

To address this limitation, we propose PPA-Plan, a proactive planning strategy for long-context reasoning that focuses on preventing such failures before plan generation. PPA-Plan identifies potential logical pitfalls and false assumptions, formulates them as negative constraints, and conditions plan generation on explicitly avoiding these constraints. Experiments on long-context QA benchmarks show that executing plans generated by PPA-Plan consistently outperforms existing plan-and-execute methods and direct prompting."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

To overcome the evaluation bottleneck, we propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that assesses nuanced visual similarity and category relevance for query-result pairs in a zero-shot manner, removing dependence on human annotations or noise-prone catalog data. Deployed at scale on a global home goods platform, our system improves retrieval quality and yields a measurable uplift in customer engagement, while our offline evaluation metrics strongly correlate with real-world outcomes."}

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method. Compared with the previous best multi-agent approach, CoA, our model achieves improvements of 40.93%, 43.70%,121.57% and 33.12%, on NarrativeQA, Qasper, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, respectively."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

To address this issue, this paper proposes an Imitation Learning-based spacecraft rendezvous and docking control framework (IL-SRD) that directly learns control policies from expert demonstrations, thereby reducing dependence on accurate modeling. We propose an anchored decoder target mechanism, which conditions the decoder queries on state-related anchors to explicitly constrain the control generation process. This mechanism enforces physically consistent control evolution and effectively suppresses implausible action deviations in sequential prediction, enabling reliable six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) rendezvous and docking control. To further enhance stability, a temporal aggregation mechanism is incorporated to mitigate error accumulation caused by the sequential prediction nature of Transformer-based models, where small inaccuracies at each time step can propagate and amplify over long horizons. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IL-SRD framework achieves accurate and energy-efficient model-free rendezvous and docking control. Robustness evaluations further confirm its capability to maintain competitive performance under significant unknown disturbances.

Inspired by their success, recent works in the molecular domain have led to the development of large molecular language models (LMLMs) that integrate 1D molecular strings or 2D molecular graphs into the language models. However, existing LMLMs often suffer from hallucination and limited robustness, largely due to inadequate integration of diverse molecular modalities such as 1D sequences, 2D molecular graphs, and 3D conformations. To address these limitations, we propose CoLLaMo, a large language model-based molecular assistant equipped with a multi-level molecular modality-collaborative projector. The relation-aware modality-collaborative attention mechanism in the projector facilitates fine-grained and relation-guided information exchange between atoms by incorporating 2D structural and 3D spatial relations. Furthermore, we present a molecule-centric new automatic measurement, including a hallucination assessment metric and GPT-based caption quality evaluation to address the limitations of token-based generic evaluation metrics (i.e., BLEU) widely used in assessing molecular comprehension of LMLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our CoLLaMo enhances the molecular modality generalization capabilities of LMLMs, achieving the best performance on multiple tasks, including molecule captioning, computed property QA, descriptive property QA, motif counting, and IUPAC name prediction."}

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization."}

In this work, we study the constrained k-center clustering problem, where instance-level cannot-link (CL) and must-link (ML) constraints are incorporated as background knowledge. Although general CL constraints significantly increase the hardness of approximation, previous work has shown that disjoint CL sets permit constant-factor approximations. However, whether local search can achieve such a guarantee in this setting remains an open question. To this end, we propose a novel local search framework based on a transformation to a dominating matching set problem, achieving the best possible approximation ratio of 2.

Here we conduct a large-scale analysis of 69,745 publications (2000 - 2025), emerging a cyclical evolution defined by coordinated expansion and contraction in publication output, international collaboration, and funding commitments that mirrors a define-ideate-test pattern. Using a theme modeling workflow designed to determine a stable thematic structure of the field, we identify five dominant thematic axes - cancer types, supportive care, clinical endpoints, mechanisms, and methodology - that signal a focus on patient well-being, scientific rigor and mechanistic exploration. Cross-theme integration of TCM is patient-centered and systems-oriented. Together with the emergent cycles of evolution, the thematic structure demonstrates progressive specialization and potential defragmentation of the field or saturation of existing research agenda.

More precisely, different state-action pairs exhibit different degree of importance or difficulty which must be actively and explicitly built into a controlled exploration strategy. To this end, we propose a weighted and parameterized family of concave coverage objectives, denoted by $U_ρ$, defined directly over state--action occupancy measures. This family unifies several widely studied objectives within a single framework, including divergence-based marginal matching, weighted average coverage, and worst-case (minimax) coverage. While the concavity of $U_ρ$ captures the diminishing return associated with over-exploration, the simple closed form of the gradient of $U_ρ$ enables an explicit control to prioritize under-explored state--action pairs. Leveraging this structure, we develop a gradient-based algorithm that actively steers the induced occupancy toward a desired coverage pattern.

We assess success rate, task duration, cumulative success, alongside NASA-TLX, SUS, and open-ended feedback. Results show statistically significant advantages for VR: higher success rates, particularly on dynamic tasks, shorter successful execution times across tasks, and earlier successes across attempts, with significantly lower workload and higher usability.

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong zero-shot abilities, they still suffer from hallucination and limited domain grounding. In contrast, discriminative Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLPMs) provide reliable grounding but require costly annotations to cover new domains.

Docs2Synth automatically processes raw document collections, generates and verifies diverse QA pairs via an agent-based system, and trains a lightweight visual retriever to extract domain-relevant evidence. During inference, the retriever collaborates with an MLLM through an iterative retrieval--generation loop, reducing hallucination and improving response consistency.

Facial dynamics are represented using landmark based features and modeled with a Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies. Speech signals are converted into mel spectrograms and processed using an Audio Spectrogram Transformer, while upper-body pose sequences are analyzed with an MLP-Mixer network to model spatiotemporal motion patterns. The extracted modality specific representations are combined through an attention-based fusion mechanism to effectively learn cross modal interactions.

Instead, we focus on Macro-F1 as a more representative measure of a model's ability across the long-tail of event types. Our experiments demonstrate that models enhanced with sentence context achieve superior performance over canonical decoder-only baselines. Using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) during finetuning provides a substantial boost in Macro-F1 scores in particular, especially for the decoder-only models, showing that LoRA can be an effective tool to enhance LLMs' performance on long-tailed event classes."}

Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) drones offer an energy-efficient alternative: they use a helium envelope to provide buoyancy, which enables near-zero-power drain during hovering and much longer operation. LTAs are promising, but their design is complex, and they lack integrated solutions to enable sustained autonomous operations and navigation with simple, low-infrastructure.\n  We propose a compact, self-sustaining LTA drone that uses light for both energy harvesting and navigation. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a high-fidelity simulation framework to analyze LTA aerodynamics and select a stable, efficient configuration; (ii) a framework to integrate solar cells on the envelope to provide net-positive energy; and (iii) a point-and-go navigation system with three light-seeking algorithms operating on a single light beacon.\n  Our LTA-analysis, together with the integrated solar panels, not only saves energy while flying, but also enables sustainable operation: providing 1 minute of flying time for every 4 minutes of energy harvesting, under illuminations of 80klux. We also demonstrate robust single-beacon navigation towards a light source that can be up to 7m away, in indoor and outdoor environments, even with moderate winds. The resulting system indicates a plausible path toward persistent, autonomous operation for indoor and outdoor monitoring. More broadly, this work provides a practical pathway for translating the promise of LTA drones into a persistent, self-sustaining aerial system."}

While the first approach objectively evaluates a singer's performance through computational metrics ranging from real-time visual feedback and acoustical biofeedback to sophisticated pitch tracking and spectral analysis, the latter method compares a predictor vocal signal with a target reference to capture nuanced data embedded in the singing voice. Notable advancements include the development of interactive systems that have significantly improved real-time visual feedback, and the integration of machine learning and deep neural network architectures that enhance the precision of vocal signal processing. This survey critically examines the literature to map the historical evolution of these technologies, while identifying and discussing key gaps. The analysis reveals persistent challenges, such as the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks, difficulties in reliably separating vocal signals from various noise sources, and the underutilization of advanced digital signal processing and artificial intelligence methodologies for capturing artistic expressivity. By detailing these limitations and the corresponding technological advances, this review demonstrates how addressing these issues can bridge the gap between objective computational assessments and subjective human-like evaluations of singing performance, ultimately enhancing both the technical accuracy and pedagogical relevance of automated singing evaluation systems."}

ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench.

For fair supervised learning, particularly in pre-processing, there have been two main categories: data fairness and task-tailored fairness. The former directly finds an intermediate distribution among the groups, independent of the type of the downstream model, so a learned downstream classification/regression model returns similar predictive scores to individuals inputting the same covariates irrespective of their sensitive attributes. The latter explicitly takes the supervised learning task into account when constructing the pre-processing map. In this work, we study algorithmic fairness for supervised learning and argue that the data fairness approaches impose overly strong regularization from the perspective of the HGR correlation. This motivates us to devise a novel pre-processing approach tailored to supervised learning. We account for the trade-off between fairness and utility in obtaining the pre-processing map. Then we study the behavior of arbitrary downstream supervised models learned on the transformed data to find sufficient conditions to guarantee their fairness improvement and utility preservation. To our knowledge, no prior work in the branch of task-tailored methods has theoretically investigated downstream guarantees when using pre-processed data. We further evaluate our framework through comparison studies based on tabular and image data sets, showing the superiority of our framework which preserves consistent trade-offs among multiple downstream models compared to recent competing models. Particularly for computer vision data, we see our method alters only necessary semantic features related to the central machine learning task to achieve fairness."}

The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination.

This paper provides a proof-of-concept system architecture for stable self-training under sparse external feedback and bounded memory, and empirically characterises its learning dynamics and failure modes.\n  We introduce a self-training architecture in which learning is mediated exclusively by environmental viability, rather than by reward, objective functions, or externally defined fitness criteria. Candidate behaviours are executed under real resource constraints, and only those whose environmental effects both persist and preserve the possibility of future interaction are propagated. The environment does not provide semantic feedback, dense rewards, or task-specific supervision; selection operates solely through differential survival of behaviours as world-altering events, making proxy optimisation impossible and rendering reward-hacking evolutionarily unstable.\n  Analysis of semantic dynamics shows that improvement arises primarily through the persistence of effective and repeatable strategies under a regime of consolidation and pruning, a paradigm we refer to as negative-space learning (NSL), and that models develop meta-learning strategies (such as deliberate experimental failure in order to elicit informative error messages) without explicit instruction. This work establishes that environment-grounded selection enables sustainable open-ended self-improvement, offering a viable path toward more robust and generalisable autonomous systems without reliance on human-curated data or complex reward shaping."}

Our experiments show that current LLM agents perform poorly with high error rates, e.g., Qwen-3-30B-Think has 35% average error rate. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a reinforcement-learning framework that augments language agent with an external memory module and optimized round-wise reward design, enabling agent to progressively infer and adapt to user preferences on-the-fly. Experiments on CalConflictBench shows that PEARL achieves 0.76 error reduction rate, and 55% improvement in average error rate compared to the strongest baseline."}

In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $Γ$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $φ$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $Γ$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $Γ$ to $NΓ$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(Γ)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $Ω(Γ)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $Γ=Θ(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $ν$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $Γ$."}

This poses significant challenges with the current standard of manual steering. In this study, we present a static modeling approach for the ExoNav, a steerable robotic tool designed to facilitate precise navigation to the ventral and lateral epidural space. Cosserat rod framework is employed to establish the relationship between tendon actuation forces and the robot's overall shape. The effects of gravity, as an example of an external load, are investigated and implemented in the model and simulation. The experimental results indicate RMSE values of 1.76mm, 2.33mm, 2.18mm, and 1.33mm across four tested prototypes. Based on the helical shape of the ExoNav upon actuation, it is capable of performing follow-the-leader (FTL) motion by adding insertion and rotation DoFs to this robotic system, which is shown in simulation and experimentally. The proposed simulation has the capability to calculate optimum tendon tensions to follow the desired FTL paths while gravity-induced robot deformations are present. Three FTL experimental trials are conducted and the end-effector position showed repeatable alignments with the desired path with maximum RMSE value of 3.75mm.

We evaluate the approach on PDE-informed regression benchmarks and standard regression datasets under a fixed training budget in a simulator setting.

While traditional methods rely on rigid, pre-defined flight paths and intensive offline processing, informative path planning (IPP) offers a way to collect data adaptively where it is most needed. Gaussian process (GP) mapping provides a continuous model of weed distribution with built-in uncertainty. However, GPs must be discretised for practical use in autonomous planning. Many discretisation techniques exist, but the impact of discrete representation choice remains poorly understood. This paper investigates how different discrete GP representations influence both mapping quality and mission-level performance in UAV-based weed mapping. Considering a UAV equipped with a downward-facing camera, we implement a receding-horizon IPP strategy that selects sampling locations based on the map uncertainty, travel cost, and coverage penalties. We investigate multiple discretisation strategies for representing the GP posterior and use their induced map partitions to generate candidate viewpoints for planning. Experiments on real-world weed distributions show that representation choice significantly affects exploration behaviour and efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that discretisation is not only a representational detail but a key design choice that shapes planning dynamics, coverage efficiency, and computational load in online UAV weed mapping."}

Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

However, existing large language model training methods primarily allow models to learn from existing textual content or solve predetermined problems, lacking experience in real scenarios involving interaction, negotiation, and competition with others. To address this, this paper proposes Multi-Agent Reward Optimization (MARO), a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire stronger reasoning abilities by learning and practicing in multi-agent social environments. Specifically, MARO first addresses the sparse learning signal problem by decomposing final success or failure outcomes into each specific behavior during the interaction process; second, it handles the uneven role distribution problem by balancing the training sample weights of different roles; finally, it addresses environmental instability issues by directly evaluating the utility of each behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that MARO not only achieves significant improvements in social reasoning capabilities, but also that the abilities acquired through social simulation learning can effectively transfer to other tasks such as mathematical reasoning and instruction following. This reveals the tremendous potential of multi-agent social learning in enhancing the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs."}

Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of \"guess what\". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines."}

However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines."}

For applicability in dynamic acoustic conditions with moving speakers, we propose to automate this rotary steering using an interleaved tracking algorithm conditioned on the target's initial direction. However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset. Real-world recordings complement these findings in complex scenarios with multiple speaker crossings and varying speaker-to-array distances."}

To enable specialization without expensive full fine-tuning, we adapt the Advice model using a mixture of LoRA experts strategy: multiple low-rank adapters are trained and a lightweight gating mechanism performs token-level expert mixing at inference, combining complementary expertise across issue types. We construct synthetic review-issue-advice triples from Yelp reviews (airlines and restaurants) to supervise training, and evaluate recommendations using an eight dimension operational rubric spanning actionability, specificity, feasibility, expected impact, novelty, non-redundancy, bias, and clarity.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how static and dynamic quantization methods impact fairness and safety across benchmarks measuring intrinsic and extrinsic bias and safety alignment. For fairness, we evaluate English, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish; for safety, we focus on English, Korean, and Arabic. Our findings reveal that quantization consistently degrades fairness and safety, with dynamic methods demonstrating greater stability than static ones. Moreover, fairness degradation varies across languages, while safety deterioration is especially pronounced in non-English settings. To address these risks, we introduce Critical Weight Protection, a novel technique that identifies and preserves fairness- and safety-critical weights during quantization. This approach effectively mitigates bias and safety deterioration without costly retraining or alignment, maintaining trustworthiness while retaining efficiency."}

Traditional approaches typically pre-train models using dynamic link prediction and directly apply the resulting node temporal embeddings to specific downstream tasks. However, the significant differences among downstream tasks often lead to performance degradation, especially under few-shot settings. Prompt tuning has emerged as an effective solution to this problem. Existing prompting methods are often strongly coupled with specific model architectures or pretraining tasks, which makes it difficult to adapt to recent or future model designs. Moreover, their exclusive focus on modifying node or temporal features while neglecting spatial structural information leads to limited expressiveness and degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose DDGPrompt, a data-centric prompting framework designed to effectively refine pre-trained node embeddings at the input data level, enabling better adaptability to diverse downstream tasks. We first define a unified node expression feature matrix that aggregates all relevant temporal and structural information of each node, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of dynamic graph models. Then, we introduce three prompt matrices (temporal bias, edge weight, and feature mask) to adjust the feature matrix completely, achieving task-specific adaptation of node embeddings. We evaluate DDGPrompt under a strict few-shot setting on four public dynamic graph datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms traditional methods and prompting approaches in scenarios with limited labels and cold-start conditions."}

However, efficiently leveraging tactile data for estimation remains a challenge due to partial observability, with single observations corresponding to multiple possible contact configurations. This limits conventional estimation approaches largely tailored to vision. We propose to address these challenges by learning an inverse tactile sensor model using denoising diffusion. The model is conditioned on tactile observations from a distributed tactile sensor and trained in simulation using a geometric sensor model based on signed distance fields. Contact constraints are enforced during inference through single-step projection using distance and gradient information from the signed distance field. For online pose estimation, we integrate the inverse model with a particle filter through a proposal scheme that combines generated hypotheses with particles from the prior belief. Our approach is validated in simulated and real-world planar pose estimation settings, without access to visual data or tight initial pose priors. We further evaluate robustness to unmodeled contact and sensor dynamics for pose tracking in a box-pushing scenario. Compared to local sampling baselines, the inverse sensor model improves sampling efficiency and estimation accuracy while preserving multimodal beliefs across objects with varying tactile discriminability."}

To bridge these gaps, we propose PsychēChat, which explicitly integrates emotion shift tracking and safety risk analysis for psychological counseling. Specifically, we employ interactive role-playing to synthesize counselor--seeker dialogues, incorporating two modules: Emotion Management Module, to capture seekers' current emotions and emotion shifts; and Risk Control Module, to anticipate seekers' subsequent reactions and identify potential risks. Furthermore, we introduce two modeling paradigms. The Agent Mode structures emotion management, risk control, and counselor responses into a collaborative multi-agent pipeline. The LLM Mode integrates these stages into a unified chain-of-thought for end-to-end inference, balancing efficiency and performance. Extensive experiments, including interactive scoring, dialogue-level evaluation, and human assessment, demonstrate that PsychēChat outperforms existing methods for emotional insight and safety control."}

Some researches have discovered that ``a backdoor path\" in the representations from forgery-irrelevant information to labels induces biased learning, thereby hindering the generalization. In this paper, these forgery-irrelevant information are collectively termed spurious correlations factors. Previous methods predominantly focused on identifying concrete, specific spurious correlation and designing corresponding solutions to address them. However, spurious correlations arise from unobservable confounding factors, making it impractical to identify and address each one individually. To address this, we propose an intervention paradigm for representation space. Instead of tracking and blocking various instance-level spurious correlation one by one, we uniformly model them as a low-rank subspace and intervene in them. Specifically, we decompose spurious correlation features into a low-rank subspace via orthogonal low-rank projection, subsequently removing this subspace from the original representation and training its orthogonal complement to capture forgery-related features. This low-rank projection removal effectively eliminates spurious correlation factors, ensuring that classification decision is based on authentic forgery cues. With only 0.43M trainable parameters, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across several benchmarks, demonstrating excellent robustness and generalization."}

The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance.

To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates.

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

To overcome this challenge, we propose decomposing each long separation filter into a bilinear form of two shorter filters, thereby reducing the number of parameters. Because the two filters are closely coupled, we design an alternating iterative projection algorithm to update them in turn. Simulation results show that, with far fewer parameters, the proposed method achieves improved performance and robustness."}

However, in this context, image retrieval typically focuses more on the image pairs of geometric matchability than on those of semantic similarity, a nuance that most existing deep learning-based methods guided by batched binaries (overlapping vs. non-overlapping pairs) fail to capture. In this paper, we introduce SupScene, a novel solution that learns global descriptors tailored for finding overlapping image pairs of similar geometric nature for SfM. First, to better underline co-visible regions, we employ a subgraph-based training strategy that moves beyond equally important isolated pairs, leveraging ground-truth geometric overlapping relationships with various weights to provide fine-grained supervision via a soft supervised contrastive loss. Second, we introduce DiVLAD, a DINO-inspired VLAD aggregator that leverages the inherent multi-head attention maps from the last block of ViT. And then, a learnable gating mechanism is designed to adaptively utilize these semantically salient cues with visual features, enabling a more discriminative global descriptor. Extensive experiments on the GL3D dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming NetVLAD while introducing a negligible number of additional trainable parameters. Furthermore, we show that the proposed training strategy brings consistent gains across different aggregation techniques.

Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines."}

These indicators are then applied to assess multiple eco-driving controllers through real-world vehicle experiments. The results reveal key tradeoffs between tracking accuracy and adaptability, showing that optimization-based controllers offer more consistent performance across varying disturbance levels, while analytical controllers may perform comparably under nominal conditions but exhibit greater sensitivity to execution and timing variability."}

Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features.

We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

The vector is computed as the residual-stream centroid difference between these regimes across 27 relations, and is injected as an additive intervention at selected layers and token spans to steer behavior in two directions: Copy$\\rightarrow$Recall (suppressing context use) and Recall$\\rightarrow$Copy (inducing the model to copy any token from the context). Experiments on two architectures (decoder-only and encoder/decoder) and two open-domain QA benchmarks show consistent behavior shifts under moderate scaling while monitoring accuracy and fluency. Mechanistic analyses of attention routing, MLP contributions, and layer-wise probability trajectories reveal an asymmetry: inducing copying is an easy ``reactivation'' process that can be triggered at different locations in the input, while restoring recall is a ``suppression'' process that is more fragile and strongly tied to object-token interventions."}

While it fails to alter the terminal learning phase in overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on high-dimensional datasets, empirical evidence consistently shows it offers significant benefits early in training. To transparently demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a small-scale model (SSM). This model is specifically designed to abstract the inherent complexities of both the DNN architecture and the input data, while maintaining key information about the structure of imbalance within its spectral components. On the one hand, the SSM reveals how vanilla empirical risk minimization preferentially learns to distinguish majority classes over minorities early in training, consequently delaying minority learning. In stark contrast, reweighting restores balanced learning dynamics, enabling the simultaneous learning of features associated with both majorities and minorities."}

In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics.

To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies.

To address this gap we propose MemeLens, a unified multilingual and multitask explanation-enhanced Vision Language Model (VLM) for meme understanding. We consolidate 38 public meme datasets, filter and map dataset-specific labels into a shared taxonomy of $20$ tasks spanning harm, targets, figurative/pragmatic intent, and affect. We present a comprehensive empirical analysis across modeling paradigms, task categories, and datasets. Our findings suggest that robust meme understanding requires multimodal training, exhibits substantial variation across semantic categories, and remains sensitive to over-specialization when models are fine-tuned on individual datasets rather than trained in a unified setting. We will make the experimental resources and datasets publicly available for the community."}

Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings."}

Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a \"Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences\" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness."}

However, existing environment generation methods often emphasize visual realism (e.g., object diversity and layout coherence), overlooking a crucial aspect: logical diversity from the testing perspective. This limits the comprehensive evaluation of agent adaptability and planning robustness in distinct simulated environments. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment. Notably, it employs constraint solving for physical plausibility. Furthermore, we introduce LogicEnvEval, a novel benchmark comprising four quantitative metrics for environment evaluation. Experimental results verify the lack of logical diversity in baselines and demonstrate that LogicEnvGen achieves 1.04-2.61x greater diversity, significantly improving the performance in revealing agent faults by 4.00%-68.00%."}

Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled framework for auditing these risks, yet existing methods achieve limited detection rates, particularly at the low false-positive thresholds required for practical privacy auditing. We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR). These results establish that privacy risks of fine-tuned language models are substantially greater than previously understood, with implications for both privacy auditing and deployment decisions.

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful solution that embeds physical laws in training by enforcing equation residuals. However, these struggle to model nonlinear dynamics, suffering from limited generalization across problems and long training times. To address these limitations, we propose a perturbation-guided transfer learning framework for PINNs (PTL-PINN), which integrates perturbation theory with transfer learning to efficiently solve nonlinear equations. Unlike gradient-based transfer learning, PTL-PINNs solve an approximate linear perturbative system using closed-form expressions, enabling rapid generalization with the time complexity of matrix-vector multiplication. We show that PTL-PINNs achieve accuracy comparable to various Runge-Kutta methods, with computational speeds up to one order of magnitude faster. To benchmark performance, we solve a broad set of problems, including nonlinear oscillators across various damping regimes, the equilibrium-centered Lotka-Volterra system, the KPP-Fisher and the Wave equation. Since perturbation theory sets the accuracy bound of PTL-PINNs, we systematically evaluate its practical applicability. This work connects long-standing perturbation methods with PINNs, demonstrating how perturbation theory can guide foundational models to solve nonlinear systems with speeds comparable to those of classical solvers."}

This limitation motivates the design of a proprioceptive membrane that conforms to the surface of interest and infers 3D geometry by reconstructing its own deformation. Conventional shape-aware membranes typically rely on resistive, capacitive, or magneto-sensitive mechanisms. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as structural complexity, limited compliance during large-scale deformation, and susceptibility to electromagnetic interference. This work presents a soft, flexible, and stretchable proprioceptive silicone membrane based on optical waveguide sensing. The membrane sensor integrates edge-mounted LEDs and centrally distributed photodiodes (PDs), interconnected via liquid-metal traces embedded within a multilayer elastomeric composite. Rich deformation-dependent light intensity signals are decoded by a data-driven model to recover the membrane geometry as a 3D point cloud. On a customized 140 mm square membrane, real-time reconstruction of large-scale out-of-plane deformation is achieved at 90 Hz with an average reconstruction error of 1.3 mm, measured by Chamfer distance, while maintaining accuracy for indentations up to 25 mm.

Clinicians interleave information gathering with irreversible actions, guided by regret, constraints and patient values. We argue that the dominant computational substrate of clinician reasoning is not cardinal optimization but ordinal, non-compensatory decision-making: Clinicians frequently rely on fast-and-frugal, lexicographic heuristics (e.g., fast-and-frugal trees) that stop early after checking a small, fixed sequence of cues. We provide a normative rationale for why such algorithms are not merely bounded rationality shortcuts, but can be epistemically preferred in medicine. First, many clinical trade-offs are constructed through human judgment and are only weakly measurable on absolute scales; without strong measurement axioms, only orderings are invariant, motivating an ordinal-by-default stance. Second, preference and signal elicitation are structurally crude: The mapping from truth $\\to$ perception $\\to$ inference $\\to$ recorded variables introduces layered noise, leaving a persistent uncertainty floor. When this 'crudeness' overwhelms the decision margin, plug-in expected-utility optimization becomes brittle (high flip probability under small perturbations), whereas robust dominance/filtering rules ($ε$-dominance, maximin) stabilize decisions.Finally, we outline a clinician-aligned AI blueprint: Use rich models for beliefs and trajectories, but choose actions through robust ordinal rules; treat heuristics as the low-dimensional special case; and deploy AI as 'selective complexity' -- invoked mainly for tie-breaking when decisions are fragile and information has positive expected impact."}

In this paper, we propose a general one-shot multimodal active perception framework for robotic manipulation. The framework enables direct inference of optimal viewpoints and comprises a data collection pipeline and an optimal viewpoint prediction network. Specifically, the framework decouples viewpoint quality evaluation from the overall architecture, supporting heterogeneous task requirements. Optimal viewpoints are defined through systematic sampling and evaluation of candidate viewpoints, after which large-scale training datasets are constructed via domain randomization. Moreover, a multimodal optimal viewpoint prediction network is developed, leveraging cross-attention to align and fuse multimodal features and directly predict camera pose adjustments. The proposed framework is instantiated in robotic grasping under viewpoint-constrained environments. Experimental results demonstrate that active perception guided by the framework significantly improves grasp success rates. Notably, real-world evaluations achieve nearly double the grasp success rate and enable seamless sim-to-real transfer without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework."}

Finally, our novel Target-Domain Aware Self-Training paradigm can generate informative pseudo-labels augmented by stable references, capturing varying and imbalanced category distributions in the target domain and enabling RADAR to adapt to the fast-changing label distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RADAR achieves superior performance for test-time FNVD, enabling strong on-the-fly adaptation to unseen fake news video topics."}

We analyze a collection of transcribed interviews with cancer patients (132,722 words in 13 interviews). We first evaluate BERTopic and Top2Vec for individual interview summarization by using similar preprocessing, chunking, and clustering configurations to ensure a fair comparison on Keyword Extraction. LLMs (GPT4) are then used for the next step topic labeling. Their outputs for a single interview (I0) are rated through a small-scale human evaluation, focusing on {coherence}, {clarity}, and {relevance}. Based on the preliminary results and evaluation, BERTopic shows stronger performance and is selected for further experimentation using three {clinically oriented embedding} models. We then analyzed the full interview collection with the best model setting. Results show that domain-specific embeddings improved topic \\textit{precision} and \\textit{interpretability}, with BioClinicalBERT producing the most consistent results across transcripts. The global analysis of the full dataset of 13 interviews, using the BioClinicalBERT embedding model, reveals the most dominant topics throughout all 13 interviews, namely ``Coordination and Communication in Cancer Care Management\" and ``Patient Decision-Making in Cancer Treatment Journey''. Although the interviews are machine translations from Dutch to English, and clinical professionals are not involved in this evaluation, the findings suggest that neural topic modeling, particularly BERTopic, can help provide useful feedback to clinicians from patient interviews. This pipeline could support more efficient document navigation and strengthen the role of patients' voices in healthcare workflows."}

A major challenge is the absence of accessible benchmark datasets for evaluating privacy risks, due to difficulties in acquiring sensitive data. To address this, we introduce SynQP, an open framework for benchmarking privacy in synthetic data generation (SDG) using simulated sensitive data, ensuring that original data remains confidential. We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches. Our work provides a critical tool for improving the transparency and reliability of privacy evaluations, enabling safer use of synthetic data in health-related applications. % In our quality evaluations, non-private models achieved near-perfect machine-learning efficacy \\(\\ge0.97\\).

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

To enable non-experts to translate intuitive design intent into manufacturable artifacts, recent large language models-based text-to-CAD efforts focus on command sequences or script-based formats like CadQuery. However, these formats are kernel-dependent and lack universality for manufacturing. In contrast, the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP, ISO 10303) file is a widely adopted, neutral boundary representation (B-rep) format directly compatible with manufacturing, but its graph-structured, cross-referenced nature poses unique challenges for auto-regressive LLMs. To address this, we curate a dataset of ~40K STEP-caption pairs and introduce novel preprocessing tailored for the graph-structured format of STEP, including a depth-first search-based reserialization that linearizes cross-references while preserving locality and chain-of-thought(CoT)-style structural annotations that guide global coherence. We integrate retrieval-augmented generation to ground predictions in relevant examples for supervised fine-tuning, and refine generation quality through reinforcement learning with a specific Chamfer Distance-based geometric reward. Experiments demonstrate consistent gains of our STEP-LLM in geometric fidelity over the Text2CAD baseline, with improvements arising from multiple stages of our framework: the RAG module substantially enhances completeness and renderability, the DFS-based reserialization strengthens overall accuracy, and the RL further reduces geometric discrepancy. Both metrics and visual comparisons confirm that STEP-LLM generates shapes with higher fidelity than Text2CAD. These results show the feasibility of LLM-driven STEP model generation from natural language, showing its potential to democratize CAD design for manufacturing."}

Yang's (2016) Tolerance Principle defines a precise threshold for how many exceptions a rule can tolerate and still be learnable. The present study explored the minimal amount and quality of training data necessary for rules to be generalized by a transformer-based language model to test the predictions of the Tolerance Principle.

This design enables the graph to act as an inductive bias for structured inference rather than a passive relational representation. The proposed model jointly supports node-level lesion-aware predictions and graph-level diagnostic reasoning, yielding intrinsic explainability through learned node importance scores without relying on post-hoc visualization techniques. We demonstrate the approach through a chest X-ray case study, illustrating how structural priors guide relational reasoning and improve interpretability.

Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space.

Providing health management for dozens of SPS and for thousands of SPS represents two fundamentally different paradigms. Therefore, to adapt the health management in the SMC era, this work proposes a principle of aligning underlying capabilities (AUC principle) and develops SpaceHMchat, an open-source Human-AI collaboration (HAIC) framework for all-in-loop health management (AIL HM). SpaceHMchat serves across the entire loop of work condition recognition, anomaly detection, fault localization, and maintenance decision making, achieving goals such as conversational task completion, adaptive human-in-the-loop learning, personnel structure optimization, knowledge sharing, efficiency enhancement, as well as transparent reasoning and improved interpretability. Meanwhile, to validate this exploration, a hardware-realistic fault injection experimental platform is established, and its simulation model is built and open-sourced, both fully replicating the real SPS. The corresponding experimental results demonstrate that SpaceHMchat achieves excellent performance across 23 quantitative metrics, such as 100% conclusion accuracy in logical reasoning of work condition recognition, over 99% success rate in anomaly detection tool invocation, over 90% precision in fault localization, and knowledge base search time under 3 minutes in maintenance decision-making.

To tell these actions apart, human often rely on the objects the driver is using, such as holding a phone compared with gripping the steering wheel. However, most existing driver-monitoring datasets lack accurate object-location annotations or do not link objects to their associated actions, leaving a critical gap for reliable action recognition. To address this, we introduce the Driver Action with Object Synergy (DAOS) dataset, comprising 9,787 video clips annotated with 36 fine-grained driver actions and 15 object classes, totaling more than 2.5 million corresponding object instances. DAOS offers multi-modal, multi-view data (RGB, IR, and depth) from front, face, left, and right perspectives. Although DAOS captures a wide range of cabin objects, only a few are directly relevant to each action for prediction, so focusing on task-specific human-object relations is essential. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Action-Object-Relation Network (AOR-Net). AOR-Net comprehends complex driver actions through multi-level reasoning and a chain-of-action prompting mechanism that models the logical relationships among actions, objects, and their relations. Additionally, the Mixture of Thoughts module is introduced to dynamically select essential knowledge at each stage, enhancing robustness in object-rich and object-scarce conditions.

To address this, we introduce CoReflect (Conversational Evaluation via Co-Evolutionary Simulation and Reflective Rubric Refinement), which unifies dialogue simulation and evaluation into an adaptive, iterative process. CoReflect employs a conversation planner that generates structured templates to guide a user simulator through diverse, goal-directed dialogues. Subsequently, a reflective analyzer processes these dialogues to identify systematic behavioral patterns and automatically refine the evaluation rubrics. Crucially, the insights from the conversation analysis are fed back into the planner to update conversation templates for subsequent iterations. This co-evolution loop ensures that the complexity of test cases and the diagnostic precision of rubrics improve in tandem. By minimizing human intervention, CoReflect provides a scalable and self-refining methodology that allows evaluation protocols to adapt alongside the rapidly advancing capabilities of dialogue models."}

TDA applies row-wise extreme-value thresholding with a length-dependent gate, retaining only exceedances. Inspired by the differential transformer, TDA also subtracts an inhibitory view to enhance expressivity. Theoretically, we prove that TDA controls the expected number of spurious survivors per row to $O(1)$ and that consensus spurious matches across independent views vanish as context grows.

We compared four modeling approaches in terms of their ability to predict body velocity from shape change within the same gait, across gaits, and across speeds. Our results show a trade-off between simpler methods which are superior on small training datasets, and more sophisticated methods, which are superior when more training data is available."}

Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories.

The model uses SegNet and DeepLabV3+ integrated with an attention-based feature fusion mechanism to achieve better boundary precision as well as improved contextual understanding. Results obtained on SAR oil spill datasets, including ALOS PALSAR imagery, confirm that the proposed DeepSegFusion model achieves an accuracy of 94.85%, an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.5685, and a ROC-AUC score of 0.9330.

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes.

This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene.

To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations."}

In this paper, we identify and address the problem of superficial reflection in LRMs. We first propose Self-Critique Fine-Tuning (SCFT), a training framework that enhances the model's reflective reasoning ability using only self-generated critiques. SCFT prompts models to critique their own outputs, filters high-quality critiques through rejection sampling, and fine-tunes the model using a critique-based objective. Building on this strong foundation, we further introduce Reinforcement Learning with Effective Reflection Rewards (RLERR). RLERR leverages the high-quality reflections initialized by SCFT to construct reward signals, guiding the model to internalize the self-correction process via reinforcement learning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, AIME2024 and AIME2025, show that SCFT and RLERR significantly improve both reasoning accuracy and reflection quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan & Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models. We further find that incorporating annealing, where the tempered distribution is gradually shifted from high to low temperature, substantially improves ToM performance over fixed-temperature power sampling.

This setting is motivated by applications involving large, sparse panel datasets, where the number of rows far exceeds the number of columns.

Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data.

We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss. Overall, ANCHOR turns ad-hoc integration glue into explicit contracts, enabling controlled degradation under load and self-healing recovery for scalable deployment of closed-loop AI systems."}

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution."}

It has been revealed that the gradient of Position Embeddings (PEs) in Transformer contains sufficient information, which can be used to reconstruct the input data. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a Masked Jigsaw Puzzle (MJP) framework. MJP starts with random token shuffling to break the token order, and then a learnable \\textit{unknown (unk)} position embedding is used to mask out the PEs of the shuffled tokens. In this manner, the local spatial information which is encoded in the position embeddings is disrupted, and the models are forced to learn feature representations that are less reliant on the local spatial information. Notably, with the careful use of MJP, we can not only improve models' robustness against gradient attacks, but also boost their performance in both vision and text application scenarios, such as classification for images (\\textit{e.g.,} ImageNet-1K) and sentiment analysis for text (\\textit{e.g.,} Yelp and Amazon). Experimental results suggest that MJP is a unified framework for different Transformer-based models in both vision and language tasks.

The model uses modality specific encoders and a shared temporal backbone pretrained with self supervised and cross modal objectives.

The visual pipeline exploits SAM for instance segmentation and Florence for semantic refinement, followed by skeletonization, endpoint detection, and point-cloud extraction. Occluded cable segments are autonomously identified and explored with a tactile sensor, which provides local point clouds that are merged with the visual data through Euclidean clustering and topology-preserving fusion. A B-spline interpolation driven by endpoint-guided point sorting yields a smooth and complete reconstruction of the cable shape. Experimental validation using a robotic manipulator equipped with an RGB-D camera and a tactile pad demonstrates that the proposed framework accurately reconstructs both simple and highly curved single or multiple cable configurations, even when large portions are occluded.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

To bridge this gap, we propose TDP-CR, a task-driven multimodal framework that jointly performs cloud removal and land-cover segmentation. Central to our approach is a Prompt-Guided Fusion (PGF) mechanism, which utilizes a learnable degradation prompt to encode cloud thickness and spatial uncertainty.

We further introduce a parameter-efficient two-phase training strategy that decouples reconstruction and semantic representation learning.

We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences.

Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies.

Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline."}

In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR.

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

Recent research tends to use modality-shared language prompts generated by CLIP to guide the learning of modal-invariant representations. Despite achieving optimal performance, such methods still face limitations in efficient spatial-temporal modeling, sufficient cross-modal interaction, and explicit modality-level loss guidance. To address these issues, we propose the language-driven sequence-level modal-invariant representation learning (LSMRL) method, which includes spatial-temporal feature learning (STFL) module, semantic diffusion (SD) module and cross-modal interaction (CMI) module. To enable parameter- and computation-efficient spatial-temporal modeling, the STFL module is built upon CLIP with minimal modifications. To achieve sufficient cross-modal interaction and enhance the learning of modal-invariant features, the SD module is proposed to diffuse modality-shared language prompts into visible and infrared features to establish preliminary modal consistency. The CMI module is further developed to leverage bidirectional cross-modal self-attention to eliminate residual modality gaps and refine modal-invariant representations. To explicitly enhance the learning of modal-invariant representations, two modality-level losses are introduced to improve the features' discriminative ability and their generalization to unseen categories.

While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent.

A large degree of distribution shift can lead to better performance even under ERM. Specifically, we derive several theoretical and empirical findings demonstrating that distribution shift plays a crucial role in model learning and benefits learning invariant prediction. Firstly, the proposed upper bounds indicate that the degree of distribution shift directly affects the prediction ability of the learned models. If it is large, the models' ability can increase, approximating invariant prediction models that make stable predictions under arbitrary known or unseen domains; and vice versa. We also prove that, under certain data conditions, ERM solutions can achieve performance comparable to that of invariant prediction models.

To make accessible earlier, authors would like to put it on arxiv before the conference", "summary": "Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

This approach discards the rich structural and contextual priors present in the original input video. Consequently, such methods often lack sufficient guidance, leading to incomplete object erasure or the synthesis of implausible content that conflicts with the scene's physical logic. In this paper, we reformulate video object removal as a video-to-video translation task via a stochastic bridge model. Unlike noise-initialized methods, our framework establishes a direct stochastic path from the source video (with objects) to the target video (objects removed). This bridge formulation effectively leverages the input video as a strong structural prior, guiding the model to perform precise removal while ensuring that the filled regions are logically consistent with the surrounding environment. To address the trade-off where strong bridge priors hinder the removal of large objects, we propose a novel adaptive mask modulation strategy. This mechanism dynamically modulates input embeddings based on mask characteristics, balancing background fidelity with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and temporal consistency."}

Among these, we employ two rationale extraction methods, which justify outcomes with human-interpretable and concise text fragments (i.e., rationales) from the given input text. We conduct comparison by evaluating faithfulness-via normalized sufficiency and comprehensiveness metrics along with plausibility-by asking legal experts to evaluate extracted rationales. We further assess the feasibility of LLM-as-a-Judge using legal expert evaluation results. We show that the model's \"reasons\" for predicting a violation differ substantially from those of legal experts, despite highly promising quantitative analysis results and reasonable downstream classification performance.

However, existing mitigation strategies tend towards an image-centric interpretation of these imbalances, often prioritising increased image attention while giving less consideration to the roles of the other modalities. In this study, we evaluate a more holistic, system-mediated account, which attributes these imbalances to functionally redundant system weights that reduce attention to image and textual inputs. We show that this framework offers a useful empirical perspective on the yes-bias, a common form of hallucination in which VLMs indiscriminately respond 'yes'. Causally redistributing attention from the system modality to image and textual inputs substantially suppresses this bias, often outperforming existing approaches. We further present evidence suggesting that system-mediated attention imbalances contribute to the yes-bias by encouraging a default reliance on coarse input representations, which are effective for some tasks but ill-suited to others. Taken together, these findings firmly establish system attention as a key factor in VLM hallucination and highlight its potential as a lever for mitigation."}

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation. Extensive experiments on RS-RVOS Bench demonstrate that MQC-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance."}

We identify the \"almost-there\" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from \"almost-there\" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters. Further analysis confirms the effectiveness of our methods in strengthening long-context reasoning while maintaining stable RL training."}

TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

We review various risks and vulnerabilities of modern general-purpose AI along eight widely accepted responsible AI (RAI) principles (fairness, privacy, explainability, robustness, safety, truthfulness, governance, and sustainability) and compare how they are non-existent or less severe and easily mitigable in traditional task-specific counterparts.

Following this, we derive C2V2 (Control, Consistency, Value, Veracity) desiderata to meet the RAI requirements for future general-purpose AI systems, and discuss how recent efforts in AI alignment, retrieval-augmented generation, reasoning enhancements, etc. fare along one or more of the desiderata. We believe that the goal of developing responsible general-purpose AI can be achieved by formally modeling application- or domain-dependent RAI requirements along C2V2 dimensions, and taking a system design approach to suitably combine various techniques to meet the desiderata."}

Most existing methods focus on salient, single foreground objects. While interactive methods allow for target adjustment, their class-agnostic design restricts generalization across different categories. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality annotation has led to a reliance on inharmonious synthetic data, resulting in poor generalization to real-world scenarios. To this end, we propose a Foreground Consistent Learning model, dubbed as FCLM, to address the aforementioned issues. Specifically, we first introduce a Depth-Aware Distillation strategy where we transfer the depth-related knowledge for better foreground representation. Considering the data dilemma, we term the processing of synthetic data as domain adaptation problem where we propose a domain-invariant learning strategy to focus on foreground learning. To support interactive prediction, we contribute an Object-Oriented Decoder that can receive both visual and language prompts to predict the referring target.

Key innovations include path optimization, thermal integration, and advanced machine learning (ML) models such as YOLO and Faster R-CNN for anomaly detection. UAVs have demonstrated value in structural health monitoring (SHM), disaster response, urban infrastructure management, energy efficiency evaluations, and cultural heritage preservation.

A proposed workflow framework, informed by literature and a case study, integrates RGB imagery, LiDAR, and thermal sensing with transformer-based architectures to improve accuracy and reliability in detecting structural defects, thermal anomalies, and geometric inconsistencies. The proposed framework ensures precise and actionable insights by fusing multimodal data and dynamically adapting path planning for complex environments, presented as a comprehensive step-by-step guide to address these challenges effectively.

The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments."}

Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties. The architecture employs hierarchical decoder heads for Black Carbon, Gas, and CO$_2$ sensor families, with two variants: PC$^2$DAE-Lean (21k parameters) for edge deployment and PC$^2$DAE-Wide (204k parameters) for offline processing.

We use simulated negotiations between paired agents under strict deadlines to investigate how LLMs adjust their behavior in time-sensitive settings. In a control condition, agents know only the global time limit. In a time-aware condition, they receive remaining-time updates at each turn. Deal closure rates are substantially higher (32\\% vs. 4\\% for GPT-5.1) and offer acceptances are sixfold higher in the time-aware condition than in the control, suggesting LLMs struggle to internally track elapsed time.

We propose a novel method for 6DoF pose estimation focused specifically on bins used in industrial settings. We exploit the cuboid geometry of bins by first detecting intermediate 3D line segments corresponding to their top edges. Our approach extends the 2D line segment detection network LeTR to operate on structured point cloud data. The detected 3D line segments are then processed using a simple geometric procedure to robustly determine the bin's 6DoF pose. To evaluate our method, we extend an existing dataset with a newly collected and annotated dataset, which we make publicly available. We show that incorporating synthetic training data significantly improves pose estimation accuracy on real scans. Moreover, we show that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art 6DoF pose estimation methods in terms of the pose accuracy (3 cm translation error, 8.2$^\\circ$ rotation error) while not requiring instance-specific CAD models during inference."}

Three deep learning models were developed and compared: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a hybrid CNN with a Support Vector Machine (CNN-SVM), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. To train these models, a data-driven labeling method based on slope ratio analysis was applied to a real oil and gas refinery dataset. The LSTM model achieved the highest accuracy and was able to predict stiction up to four hours in advance. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate ML based early prediction of control valve stiction from real industry data. The proposed framework can be integrated into existing control systems to support predictive maintenance, reduce downtime, and avoid unnecessary hardware replacement."}

Most existing design methods focus on vector-valued responses (e.g., Young's modulus and bandgap width), while the inverse design of functional responses remains challenging due to their high-dimensionality, the complexity of accommodating design requirements in inverse-design frameworks, and non-existence or non-uniqueness of feasible solutions. Although generative design approaches have shown promise, they are often data-hungry, handle design requirements heuristically, and may generate infeasible designs without uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce a RAndom-forest-based Generative approach (RAG). By leveraging the small-data compatibility of random forests, RAG enables data-efficient predictions of high-dimensional functional responses. During the inverse design, the framework estimates the likelihood through the ensemble which quantifies the trustworthiness of generated designs while reflecting the relative difficulty across different requirements. The one-to-many mapping is addressed through single-shot design generation by sampling from the conditional likelihood. We demonstrate RAG on: 1) acoustic metamaterials with prescribed partial passbands/stopbands, and 2) mechanical metamaterials with targeted snap-through responses, using 500 and 1057 samples, respectively. Its data-efficiency is benchmarked against neural networks on a public mechanical metamaterial dataset with nonlinear stress-strain relations.

Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence.

Existing detection methods achieve near-perfect performance when training and testing are conducted within the same domain, yet their effectiveness deteriorates substantially in crossdomain scenarios. This limitation is problematic, as new forgery techniques continuously emerge and detectors must remain reliable against unseen manipulations. To address this challenge, we propose the Real-Centered Detection Network (RCDN), a frequency spatial convolutional neural networks(CNN) framework with an Xception backbone that anchors its representation space around authentic facial images. Instead of modeling the diverse and evolving patterns of forgeries, RCDN emphasizes the consistency of real images, leveraging a dual-branch architecture and a real centered loss design to enhance robustness under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the DiFF dataset, focusing on three representative forgery types (FE, I2I, T2I), demonstrate that RCDN achieves both state-of-the-art in-domain accuracy and significantly stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, RCDN reduces the generalization gap compared to leading baselines and achieves the highest cross/in-domain stability ratio, highlighting its potential as a practical solution for defending against evolving and unseen image forgery techniques."}

However, existing factual recall evaluations primarily assess fact retrieval in isolation, where the queried entity is explicitly named and the fact is requested directly. In natural language use, facts are often accessed through context, where the relevant entity is introduced only indirectly. In this work, we study contextually mediated factual recall, asking whether LLMs can reliably retrieve factual knowledge when the target entity is embedded in a naturalistic context rather than queried explicitly, across languages. We construct controlled prompts that preserve the underlying fact while introducing referential mediation through contextual sentences. To disentangle contextual effects from name-specific associations, we further compare performance using synthetic names and real names across languages. Evaluating multiple model families in five languages, we find that contextual mediation consistently degrades factual recall, with substantial variation across relations. Larger models are more robust to contextual mediation, exhibiting a reduced performance gap relative to direct queries, while the effect of real names and name origin is mixed and unsystematic. These findings highlight a gap between isolated factual recall and context-dependent language understanding in multilingual LLMs."}

Developing accurate prediction algorithms relies on reliable, multimodal, and realistic datasets; however, such datasets for roundabout scenarios are scarce, as real-world data collection is often limited by incomplete observations and entangled factors that are difficult to isolate. We present CARLA-Round, a systematically designed simulation dataset for roundabout trajectory prediction. The dataset varies weather conditions (five types) and traffic density levels (spanning Level-of-Service A-E) in a structured manner, resulting in 25 controlled scenarios. Each scenario incorporates realistic mixtures of driving behaviors and provides explicit annotations that are largely absent from existing datasets. Unlike randomly sampled simulation data, this structured design enables precise analysis of how different conditions influence trajectory prediction performance. Validation experiments using standard baselines (LSTM, GCN, GRU+GCN) reveal traffic density dominates prediction difficulty with strong monotonic effects, while weather shows non-linear impacts. The best model achieves 0.312m ADE on real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer.

LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system.

Although strong epidemiological evidence links oral health outcomes to socio-economic and demographic determinants, most artificial intelligence (AI) applications in dentistry rely on image-based diagnosis and black-box prediction models, limiting transparency and ethical applicability in pediatric populations.\n  Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an explainable machine learning framework for pediatric dental risk stratification that prioritizes interpretability, calibration, and ethical deployment over maximal predictive accuracy.\n  Methods: A supervised machine learning model was trained using population-level pediatric data including age, income-to-poverty ratio, race/ethnicity, gender, and medical history. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curves. Explainability was achieved using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide global and individual-level interpretation of predictions.\n  Results: The model achieved modest discrimination (AUC = 0.61) with conservative calibration, underestimating risk at higher probability levels.

As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception.

Peptide binder generation is critical in therapeutic and biochemical applications, yet many existing methods rely heavily on intermediate structure prediction, adding complexity and limiting sequence diversity. Our approach departs from this paradigm by generating binder sequences directly in a continuous latent space derived from a pretrained protein embedding model, without relying on predicted structures, thereby improving structural and sequence diversity. To encourage the model to capture binding-relevant features rather than memorizing known sequences, we perform latent-space exploration and diffusion-based sampling, enabling the generation of peptides beyond the limited distribution of known binders. This zero-shot generative strategy leverages the global protein embedding manifold as a semantic prior, allowing the model to propose novel peptide sequences in previously unseen regions of the protein space. We evaluate PepEDiff on TIGIT, a challenging target with a large, flat protein-protein interaction interface that lacks a druggable pocket. Despite its simplicity, our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across benchmark tests and in the TIGIT case study, demonstrating its potential as a general, structure-free framework for zero-shot peptide binder design.

Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously.

With the rise of generative AI, fully automated and human-AI workflows have emerged as promising methods for analysis. However, methodological standards to guide such workflows remain limited. In this study, we propose that reasoning traces generated by large language model (LLM) agents, especially within multi-agent systems, constitute a novel and rich form of process data to enhance interpretive practices in qualitative coding. We apply cosine similarity to LLM reasoning traces to systematically detect, quantify, and interpret disagreements among agents, reframing disagreement as a meaningful analytic signal. Analyzing nearly 10,000 instances of agent pairs coding human tutoring dialog segments, we show that LLM agents' semantic reasoning similarity robustly differentiates consensus from disagreement and correlates with human coding reliability. Qualitative analysis guided by this metric reveals nuanced instructional sub-functions within codes and opportunities for conceptual codebook refinement. By integrating quantitative similarity metrics with qualitative review, our method has the potential to improve and accelerate establishing inter-rater reliability during coding by surfacing interpretive ambiguity, especially when LLMs collaborate with humans. We discuss how reasoning-trace disagreements represent a valuable new class of analytic signals advancing methodological rigor and interpretive depth in educational research."}

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42). This geometry predicts learnability. We introduce Neural Reasoning Operators - learned mappings from initial to terminal hidden states. In crystalline legal reasoning, our operator achieves 63.6% accuracy on held-out tasks via probe decoding, predicting reasoning endpoints without traversing intermediate states. We further identify a universal oscillatory signature (coherence ~ -0.4) invariant across domains and scales, suggesting attention and feedforward layers drive reasoning through opposing dynamics.

To tackle this challenge, we propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based THz self-supervised denoising and deblurring network (THz-SSDD). The network employs a Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted self-supervised learning strategy to capture the intrinsic features of noise by exploiting invariance under repeated corruption. PCA decomposition and reconstruction are then applied to restore images across both low and high frequencies. The performance of the THz-SSDD network was evaluated on four types of samples. Training requires only a small set of unlabeled noisy images, and testing across samples with different material properties and measurement modes demonstrates effective denoising and deblurring. Quantitative analysis further validates the network feasibility, showing improvements in image quality while preserving the physical characteristics of the original signals."}

Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance."}

A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation."}

We present a controlled comparison of six fine-tuning objectives -- Supervised Fine-Tuning, Direct Preference Optimization, Conditional Fine-Tuning, Inoculation Prompting, Odds Ratio Preference Optimization, and KL-regularized fine-tuning -- holding data, domain, architecture, and optimization fixed. Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases."}

The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication. The environment is monitored via the digital twin through the shared messages which update the information of the spawned ego vehicle and detected objects based on the real-time localization and perception data.

This version corresponds to the initial public release of the CUA architecture and associated evaluation metrics", "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new forms of AI-assisted reasoning across scientific, technical, and organizational domains. However, prevailing modes of LLM use remain cognitively unstructured: problem framing, knowledge exploration, retrieval, methodological awareness, and explanation are typically collapsed into a single generative process. This cognitive collapse limits traceability, weakens epistemic control, and undermines reproducibility, particularly in high-responsibility settings.\n  We introduce Explicit Cognitive Allocation, a general principle for structuring AI-assisted inference through the explicit separation and orchestration of epistemic functions. We instantiate this principle in the Cognitive Universal Agent (CUA), an architecture that organizes inference into distinct stages of exploration and framing, epistemic anchoring, instrumental and methodological mapping, and interpretive synthesis. Central to this framework is the notion of Universal Cognitive Instruments (UCIs), which formalize heterogeneous means, including computational, experimental, organizational, regulatory, and educational instruments, through which abstract inquiries become investigable.\n  We evaluate the effects of explicit cognitive and instrumental allocation through controlled comparisons between CUA-orchestrated inference and baseline LLM inference under matched execution conditions. Across multiple prompts in the agricultural domain, CUA inference exhibits earlier and structurally governed epistemic convergence, higher epistemic alignment under semantic expansion, and systematic exposure of the instrumental landscape of inquiry. In contrast, baseline LLM inference shows greater variability in alignment and fails to explicitly surface instrumental structure."}

This paper introduces collaborative inverse rendering with persistent homology priors, a novel strategy that leverages topological constraints to resolve these ambiguities. By incorporating priors that capture critical features such as tunnel loops and handle loops, our approach directly addresses the difficulty of reconstructing high-genus surfaces. The collaboration between photometric consistency from multi-view images and homology-based guidance enables recovery of complex high-genus geometry while circumventing catastrophic failures such as collapsing tunnels or losing high-genus structure. Instead of neural networks, our method relies on gradient-based optimization within a mesh-based inverse rendering framework to highlight the role of topological priors. Experimental results show that incorporating persistent homology priors leads to lower Chamfer Distance (CD) and higher Volume IoU compared to state-of-the-art mesh-based methods, demonstrating improved geometric accuracy and robustness against topological failure."}

This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports. We evaluate multiple local and commercial LLMs under instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting to extract structured procedural information from 414 curated interventional radiology reports authored by nine residents between 2018 and 2024. Model performance is assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, alongside inference latency and token efficiency to estimate operational cost. Results show that both local and commercial models achieve strong extraction performance, with best F1-scores approaching 0.87, while exhibiting different trade-offs between speed and cost. Automation using LLMs has the potential to substantially reduce clerical burden for trainees and improve consistency in case logging. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI-assisted documentation in medical education and highlight the need for further validation across institutions and clinical workflows."}

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data. This work proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines. The results highlight the importance of structured temporal representations and show that decoupling local temporal encoding from global attention-based modelling yields more effective and stable time-series forecasting."}

While visual foundation models (VFMs) provide strong local features, most existing methods rely on a single model, overlooking the complementary cues offered by different VFMs. However, exploiting such complementary information inevitably alters token distributions, which challenges the stability of existing query-based global aggregation schemes. To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes."}

We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples.

We present VIRTUE, an MLLM-based versatile video retrieval framework that integrates corpus and moment-level retrieval capabilities while accommodating composed multimodal queries within a single architecture. We use contrastive alignment of visual and textual embeddings generated using a shared MLLM backbone to facilitate efficient embedding-based candidate search. Our embedding model, trained efficiently using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on 700K paired visual-text data samples, surpasses other MLLM-based methods on zero-shot video retrieval tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate that the same model can be adapted without further training to achieve competitive results on zero-shot moment retrieval, and state of the art results for zero-shot composed video retrieval. With additional training for reranking candidates identified in the embedding-based search, our model substantially outperforms existing MLLM-based retrieval systems and achieves retrieval performance comparable to state of the art specialized models which are trained on orders of magnitude larger data."}

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized."}

Moreover, most guardian models rely on rigid, predefined safety categories that fail to generalize across diverse linguistic and sociocultural contexts. Robust safety, therefore, requires flexible, runtime-enforceable policies and benchmarks that reflect local norms, harm scenarios, and cultural expectations. We introduce UbuntuGuard, the first African policy-based safety benchmark built from adversarial queries authored by 155 domain experts across sensitive fields, including healthcare. From these expert-crafted queries, we derive context-specific safety policies and reference responses that capture culturally grounded risk signals, enabling policy-aligned evaluation of guardian models. We evaluate 13 models, comprising six general-purpose LLMs and seven guardian models across three distinct variants: static, dynamic, and multilingual. Our findings reveal that existing English-centric benchmarks overestimate real-world multilingual safety, cross-lingual transfer provides partial but insufficient coverage, and dynamic models, while better equipped to leverage policies at inference time, still struggle to fully localize African-language contexts. These findings highlight the urgent need for multilingual, culturally grounded safety benchmarks to enable the development of reliable and equitable guardian models for low-resource languages.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum.

However, histopathology images often contain artifacts introduced during slide preparation and digitization. Detecting and excluding them is essential to ensure reliable downstream analysis. Traditional supervised models typically require large annotated datasets, which is resource-intensive and not generalizable to novel artifact types. To address this, we propose DiffusionQC, which detects artifacts as outliers among clean images using a diffusion model. It requires only a set of clean images for training rather than pixel-level artifact annotations and predefined artifact types. Furthermore, we introduce a contrastive learning module to explicitly enlarge the distribution separation between artifact and clean images, yielding an enhanced version of our method.

Although compiler optimizations and hand-written kernels can partially alleviate this issue, achieving near-hardware-limit performance still relies heavily on manual code refactoring and parameter tuning. Recent progress in LLM-agent-based kernel generation and optimization has been reported, yet many approaches primarily focus on direct code rewriting, where parameter choices are often implicit and hard to control, or require human intervention, leading to unstable performance gains. This paper introduces a template-based rewriting layer on top of an agent-driven iterative loop: kernels are semantically refactored into explicitly parameterizable templates, and template parameters are then optimized via search-based autotuning, yielding more stable and higher-quality speedups. Experiments on a set of real-world kernels demonstrate speedups exceeding 3x in the best case. We extract representative CUDA kernels from SGLang as evaluation targets; the proposed agentic tuner iteratively performs templating, testing, analysis, and planning, and leverages profiling feedback to execute constrained parameter search under hardware resource limits. Compared to agent-only direct rewriting, the template-plus-search design significantly reduces the randomness of iterative optimization, making the process more interpretable and enabling a more systematic approach toward high-performance configurations. The proposed method can be further extended to OpenCL, HIP, and other backends to deliver automated performance optimization for real production workloads."}

We propose several improvements that address these fundamental challenges, namely, a Hessian regularization scheme that penalizes unphysical signatures in the Lagrangian's second derivatives with respect to velocities, preventing the network from learning unstable dynamics, activation functions that are better suited to the problem of learning Lagrangians, and a physics-aware coordinate scaling that improves stability. We systematically evaluate these techniques alongside previously proposed methods for improving stability. Our improved architecture successfully trains on systems of unprecedented complexity, including triple pendulums, and achieved 96.6\\% lower validation loss value and 90.68\\% better stability than baseline LNNs in double pendulum systems. With the improved framework, we show that our LNNs can learn Lagrangians representing geodesic motion in both non-relativistic and general relativistic settings.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation.

PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%.

In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation."}

While the most common decision tree learning algorithms treat data as a batch, numerous algorithms have been proposed to construct decision trees from a data stream.

Here we typically maintain counters in each leaf which allow us to determine the optimal split, and whether the split should be done. In this paper we focus on how to speed up the search for the optimal split when dealing with sparse binary features and a binary class. We focus on finding splits that have the approximately optimal information gain or Gini index. In both cases finding the optimal split can be done in $O(d)$ time, where $d$ is the number of features. We propose an algorithm that yields $(1 + α)$ approximation when using conditional entropy in amortized $O(α^{-1}(1 + m\\log d) \\log \\log n)$ time, where $m$ is the number of 1s in a data point, and $n$ is the number of data points. Similarly, for Gini index, we achieve $(1 + α)$ approximation in amortized $O(α^{-1} + m \\log d)$ time. Our approach is beneficial for sparse data where $m \\ll d$.

To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

We design heuristic policies, train learning agents with expert demonstrations, and improve them using Dataset Aggregation (DAgger). From a theoretical standpoint, we show that gamification reduces model complexity and yields tighter generalization bounds than vector-based formulations. Experiments across multiple EV arrival patterns confirm that gamified learning enhances load balancing. In particular, the image-to-movement model trained with DAgger consistently outperforms heuristic baselines, vector-based approaches, and supervised learning agents, while also demonstrating robustness in sensitivity analyses.

Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning.

In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations.

Based on these findings, we introduce the Entropy-Guided Latent Reasoning (EGLR) recommendation model, which has three core advantages. First, it abandons the \"reason first, recommend later\" paradigm to achieve \"reasoning while recommending\", specifically designed for the high-difficulty nature of list generation by enabling real-time reasoning during generation. Second, it implements entropy-guided variable-length reasoning using context-aware reasoning token alongside dynamic temperature adjustment, expanding exploration breadth in reasoning and boosting exploitation precision in recommending to achieve a more precisely adapted exploration-exploitation trade-off. Third, the model adopts a lightweight integration design with no complex independent modules or post-processing, enabling easy adaptation to existing models. Experimental results on two real-world datasets validate the model's effectiveness, and its notable advantage lies in being compatible with existing generative re-ranking models to enhance their performance.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum.

Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts.

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination."}

Nationality Prediction via Large Language Model Associative Memory", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive world knowledge, yet methods for effectively eliciting this knowledge remain underexplored. Nationality and region prediction tasks require understanding of not only linguistic features but also cultural and historical background, making LLM world knowledge particularly valuable. However, conventional LLM prompting methods rely on direct reasoning approaches, which have limitations in applying abstract linguistic rules. We propose LLM Associative Memory Agents (LAMA), a novel framework that leverages LLM world knowledge as associative memory. Rather than directly inferring nationality from names, LAMA recalls famous individuals with the same name and aggregates their nationalities through indirect reasoning. A dual-agent architecture comprising a Person Agent and a Media Agent, specialized in different knowledge domains, recalls famous individuals in parallel, generating Top-1 predictions through voting and Top-K predictions through conditional completion. On a 99-country nationality prediction task, LAMA achieved 0.817 accuracy, substantially outperforming conventional LLM prompting methods and neural models. Our experiments reveal that LLMs exhibit higher reliability in recalling concrete examples than in abstract reasoning, that recall-based approaches are robust to low-frequency nationalities independent of data frequency distributions, and that the dual-agent architecture functions complementarily to produce synergistic effects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of a new multi-agent system that retrieves and aggregates LLM knowledge rather than prompting reasoning."}

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

Our approach coordinates three specialized agents: a Profiling Agent that analyzes model architecture and MAC distributions, a Master Agent that orchestrates the workflow with divergence monitoring, and an Analysis Agent powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet that learns optimal strategies from historical attempts. Through in-context learning, the Analysis Agent improves convergence success rate from 48% to 71% compared to grid search.

Efforts based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have attempted to address these assumptions but continue to reinforce what we term the SPECIALISATION FALLACY-the belief that specialised medical LLMs are inherently superior for CQA. To address this assumption, we introduce MEDASSESS-X, a deployment-industry-oriented CQA framework that applies alignment at inference time rather than through SFT. MEDASSESS-X uses lightweight steering vectors to guide model activations toward medically consistent reasoning without updating model weights or requiring domain-specific retraining. This inference-time alignment layer stabilises CQA performance across both general-purpose and specialised medical LLMs, thereby resolving the SPECIALISATION FALLACY.

In particular, the widely used softmax parameterization can induce ill-conditioned optimization landscapes and lead to exponentially slow convergence. Although this can be mitigated by preconditioning, this solution is often computationally expensive. Instead, we propose replacing the softmax with an alternative family of policy parameterizations based on the generalized f-softargmax. We further advocate coupling this parameterization with a regularizer induced by the same f-divergence, which improves the optimization landscape and ensures that the resulting regularized objective satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality. Leveraging this structure, we establish the first explicit non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees for stochastic policy gradient methods for finite MDPs without any form of preconditioning. We also derive sample-complexity bounds for the unregularized problem and show that f-PG, with Tsallis divergences achieves polynomial sample complexity in contrast to the exponential complexity incurred by the standard softmax parameterization."}

An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes. Experimental results demonstrate that CytoCLIP outperforms existing methods. It achieves an F1 score of 0.87 for whole-region classification and 0.91 for high-resolution image tile classification."}

This requires $|λ- \\AM| < \\AM$ and diverges when $κ> 4$. We work instead with the moment-generating function $M(t) = \\E[X^t]$ for normalized eigenvalues $X = λ/\\AM$. Since $M'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$, the log-determinant becomes $\\log\\det(A) = n(\\log \\AM + M'(0))$ -- the problem reduces to estimating a derivative at $t = 0$. Trace powers give $M(k)$ at positive integers, but interpolating $M(t)$ directly is ill-conditioned due to exponential growth. The transform $K(t) = \\log M(t)$ compresses this range. Normalization by $\\AM$ ensures $K(0) = K(1) = 0$. With these anchors fixed, we interpolate $K$ through $m+1$ consecutive integers and differentiate to estimate $K'(0)$. However, this local interpolation cannot capture arbitrary spectral features.\n  We prove a fundamental limit: no continuous estimator using finitely many positive moments can be uniformly accurate over unbounded conditioning. Positive moments downweight the spectral tail; $K'(0) = \\E[\\log X]$ is tail-sensitive. This motivates guaranteed bounds. From the same traces we derive upper bounds on $(\\det A)^{1/n}$.

The project addresses a central methodological challenge in educational and interactional research: the analysis of verbal, paraverbal, and non-verbal data is currently carried out manually, making it extremely time-consuming and difficult to scale. TRAIMA explores how machine learning approaches could contribute to the categorisation and classification of such interactions. The project focuses specifically on explanatory and collaborative sequences occurring in classroom interactions, particularly in French as a Foreign Language (FLE) and French as a First Language (FLM) contexts. These sequences are analysed as inherently multimodal phenomena, combining spoken language with prosody, gestures, posture, gaze, and spatial positioning. A key theoretical contribution of the project is the precise linguistic and interactional definition of explanatory discourse as a tripartite sequence (opening, explanatory core, closure), drawing on discourse analysis and interactional linguistics. A substantial part of the research is devoted to the methodological foundations of transcription, which constitute a critical bottleneck for any form of automation. The report provides a detailed state of the art of existing transcription conventions (ICOR, Mondada, GARS, VALIBEL, Ferr{é}), highlighting their respective strengths and limitations when applied to multimodal classroom data. Through comparative analyses of manually transcribed sequences, the project demonstrates the inevitable variability and interpretative dimension of transcription practices, depending on theoretical positioning and analytical goals. Empirical work is based on several corpora, notably the INTER-EXPLIC corpus (approximately 30 hours of classroom interaction) and the EXPLIC-LEXIC corpus, which serve both as testing grounds for manual annotation and as reference datasets for future automation. Particular attention is paid to teacher gestures (kin{é}sic and proxemic resources), prosodic features, and their functional role in meaning construction and learner comprehension. The project also highlights the strategic role of the Techn{é}LAB platform, which provides advanced multimodal data capture (multi-camera video, synchronized audio, eye-tracking, digital interaction traces) and constitutes both a research infrastructure and a test environment for the development of automated tools. In conclusion, TRAIMA does not aim to deliver a fully operational automated system, but rather to establish a rigorous methodological framework for the automatic processing of multimodal pedagogical interactions. The project identifies transcription conventions, annotation categories, and analytical units that are compatible with machine learning approaches, while emphasizing the need for theoretical explicitness and researcher reflexivity. TRAIMA thus lays the groundwork for future interdisciplinary research at the intersection of didactics, discourse analysis, multimodality, and artificial intelligence in education."}

Our approach leverages continuous gene representations aligned with contemporary deep learning scales, incorporates dynamic evolutionary operators with adaptive scheduling, and utilizes a modular PyTorch implementation for seamless integration with modern architectures.

This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

Although some units encode sensitive or stereotype-related associations from pretraining, identical demographic cues can induce qualitatively different behaviors. Interventions suppressing such neurons reduce bias but leave substantial residual effects, suggesting behavioral rather than representational change and motivating more systematic mitigation."}

Yet most 3D molecular graph neural networks still rely on globally fixed neighborhood heuristics, typically defined by distance cutoffs and maximum neighbor limits, to define local message-passing neighborhoods, leading to rigid, data-agnostic interaction budgets. We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks. These results highlight topology-aware multiscale routing as an effective principle for 3D molecular graph learning."}

It comprises three components: the Crime Script Inference Task (CSIT) for scam reasoning, the Crime Script-Aware Inference Dataset (CSID) for fine-tuning small LLMs, and the Cognitive Simulation-based Evaluation of Social Engineering Defense (CSED) for assessing real-time cognitive impact. Using 571 Korean phone scam cases, we built 22,712 structured scammer-sequence training instances. Experimental results show that the 11B small LLM fine-tuned with ScriptMind outperformed GPT-4o by 13%, achieving superior performance over commercial models in detection accuracy, false-positive reduction, scammer utterance prediction, and rationale quality. Moreover, in phone scam simulation experiments, it significantly enhanced and sustained users' suspicion levels, improving their cognitive awareness of scams.

Concept-based interpretations aim to address this by explaining model reasoning through human-understandable concepts. However, existing post-hoc methods and ante-hoc concept bottleneck models (CBMs), suffer from limitations such as unreliable concept relevance, non-visual or labor-intensive concept definitions, and model or data-agnostic assumptions. This paper introduces Post-hoc Concept Bottleneck Model via Representation Decomposition (PCBM-ReD), a novel pipeline that retrofits interpretability onto pretrained opaque models. PCBM-ReD automatically extracts visual concepts from a pre-trained encoder, employs multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to label and filter concepts based on visual identifiability and task relevance, and selects an independent subset via reconstruction-guided optimization. Leveraging CLIP's visual-text alignment, it decomposes image representations into linear combination of concept embeddings to fit into the CBMs abstraction. Extensive experiments across 11 image classification tasks show PCBM-ReD achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, narrows the performance gap with end-to-end models, and exhibits better interpretability."}

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention."}

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

This study builds upon CurConMix, a spatial representation framework. At its core, a curriculum-guided contrastive learning strategy learns discriminative and progressively correlated features, further enhanced by structured hard-pair sampling and feature-level mixup.

We evaluated the framework on the Smart Logistics Dataset 2024, which contains real-world Internet of Things(IoT) sensor data. The experimental results show that the RADR algorithm significantly enhances the resilience of the supply chain.

Empirically, we apply this methodology to Pythia-14M, developing a conductance-based clustering algorithm that identifies 510 interpretable clusters ranging from grammatical patterns to code structure to mathematical notation. Comparing to sparse autoencoders, 50% of our clusters match SAE features, validating that both methods recover similar structure."}

We introduce SocialMindChange, a benchmark that moves from tracking minds to changing minds in social interaction. Each instance defines a social context with 4 characters and five connected scenes. The model plays one character and generates dialogue across the five scenes to reach the target while remaining consistent with the evolving states of all participants. SocialMindChange also includes selected higher-order states. Using a structured four-step framework, we construct 1,200 social contexts, covering 6000 scenarios and over 90,000 questions, each validated for realism and quality. Evaluations on ten state-of-the-art LLMs show that their average performance is 54.2% below human performance.

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

Evaluating Conversational Repair in Large Audio-Language Models", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated strong performance in spoken question answering (QA), with existing evaluations primarily focusing on answer accuracy and robustness to acoustic perturbations. However, such evaluations implicitly assume that spoken inputs remain semantically answerable, an assumption that often fails in real-world interaction when essential information is missing. In this work, we introduce a repair-aware evaluation setting that explicitly distinguishes between answerable and unanswerable audio inputs. We define answerability as a property of the input itself and construct paired evaluation conditions using a semantic-acoustic masking protocol. Based on this setting, we propose the Evaluability Awareness and Repair (EAR) score, a non-compensatory metric that jointly evaluates task competence under answerable conditions and repair behavior under unanswerable conditions. Experiments on two spoken QA benchmarks across diverse LALMs reveal a consistent gap between answer accuracy and conversational reliability: while many models perform well when inputs are answerable, most fail to recognize semantic unanswerability and initiate appropriate conversational repair. These findings expose a limitation of prevailing accuracy-centric evaluation practices and motivate reliability assessments that treat unanswerable inputs as cues for repair and continued interaction."}

A wide range of techniques (from classical statistical models to neural network-based approaches such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) have been employed to address time series forecasting challenges. In this paper, we reframe time series forecasting as a two-part task: (1) predicting the trend (directional movement) of the time series at the next time step, and (2) forecasting the quantitative value at the next time step. The trend can be predicted using a binary classifier, while quantitative values can be forecasted using models such as LSTM and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM). Building on this reframing, we propose the Trend-Adjusted Time Series (TATS) model, which adjusts the forecasted values based on the predicted trend provided by the binary classifier. We validate the proposed approach through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. The TATS model is applied to a volatile financial time series (the daily gold price) with the objective of forecasting the next days price. Experimental results demonstrate that TATS consistently outperforms standard LSTM and Bi-LSTM models by achieving significantly lower forecasting error. In addition, our results indicate that commonly used metrics such as MSE and MAE are insufficient for fully assessing time series model performance. Therefore, we also incorporate trend detection accuracy, which measures how effectively a model captures trends in a time series."}

In this work, we challenge this assumption by investigating whether these metrics truly capture inter-step causal dependencies necessary for valid reasoning. We introduce three classes of inter-step causality perturbations that systematically disrupt dependencies between reasoning steps while preserving local fluency. Surprisingly, across diverse model families and reasoning benchmarks, we find that selection accuracy degrades only marginally under these disruptions. Even severe interventions, such as applying hard attention masks that directly prevent the model from attending to prior reasoning steps, do not substantially reduce selection performance. These findings provide strong evidence that current probabilistic metrics are largely insensitive to logical structure, and primarily capture surface-level fluency or in-distribution priors instead. Motivated by this gap, we propose a contrastive causality metric that explicitly isolates inter-step causal dependencies, and demonstrate that it yields more faithful output selection than existing probability-based approaches."}

MSA-KG explicitly encode the causal chain among object-attribute-emotion, and as external knowledge to support chain of thought reasoning, guiding the multimodal large model to infer plausible emotion-related visual cues and generate coherent instructions.

To explore this boundary in dentistry, a domain where high-quality AI advice uniquely empowers patient-participatory decision-making, we present the Standardized Clinical Management & Performance Evaluation (SCMPE) benchmark, which comprehensively assesses performance from knowledge-oriented evaluations (static objective tasks) to workflow-based simulations (multi-turn simulated patient interactions). Our analysis reveals that while models demonstrate high proficiency in static objective tasks, their performance precipitates in dynamic clinical dialogues, identifying that the primary bottleneck lies not in knowledge retention, but in the critical challenges of active information gathering and dynamic state tracking. Mapping \"Guideline Adherence\" versus \"Decision Quality\" reveals a prevalent \"High Efficacy, Low Safety\" risk in general models. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While RAG mitigates hallucinations in static tasks, its efficacy in dynamic workflows is limited and heterogeneous, sometimes causing degradation. This underscores that external knowledge alone cannot bridge the reasoning gap without domain-adaptive pre-training. This study empirically charts the capability boundaries of dental LLMs, providing a roadmap for bridging the gap between standardized knowledge and safe, autonomous clinical practice."}

To tackle this problem, we develop a unified framework for reward function recovery in two-player zero-sum matrix games and Markov games with entropy regularization, where we aim to reconstruct the underlying reward functions given observed players' strategies and actions. This task is challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of inverse problems, the non-uniqueness of feasible rewards, and limited observational data coverage. To address these challenges, we establish the reward function's identifiability using the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) under linear assumptions. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we propose a novel algorithm to learn reward functions from observed actions. Our algorithm works in both static and dynamic settings and is adaptable to incorporate different methods, such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the reliability and sample efficiency of our algorithm. Further, we conduct extensive numerical studies to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed framework, offering new insights into decision-making in competitive environments."}

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior."}

However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a \"bitter lesson\": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks."}

With Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), training tends to be exploitation driven: entropy decreases monotonically, samples convergence, and exploration fades. Most existing fixes are \\textbf{sample-centric}: they seek or bonus rare samples, assuming exploration comes from novel trajectories and tokens. These heuristics depend on the \"luck\" of informative samples, lack principled control of the policy, and often yield limited or inconsistent gains. In this work, we are the first to introduce a \\textbf{distribution-centric} perspective for RL, in which exploration is always guided by a \"better\" target distribution, and reveal that a policy's ability to resist entropy collapse is governed by the distribution itself rather than individual samples. Building on this insight, we propose Distribution-Centric Policy Optimization (DCPO), which reformulates entropy regulation as distribution-level regularization. DCPO achieves controllable entropy fully on-policy without sampling from external distributions, enabling efficient exploration while maintaining training stability. Across multiple models and seven benchmarks, DCPO improves over GRPO by about 20\\% on average. Overall, DCPO replaces sample-level heuristics with distribution-level principles, offering a theoretically grounded and flexible framework for controllable exploration and a stronger EE trade-off.

Existing methods primarily relt on two prior assumption: low-rank background and sparse anomaly, along with additional spatial assumptions of the background. However, most methods only utilize the sparsity prior assumption for anomalies and rarely expand on this hypothesis. From observations of hyperspectral images, we find that anomalous pixels exhibit certain spatial distribution characteristics: they often manifest as small, clustered groups in space, which we refer to as cluster sparsity of anomalies. Then, we combined the cluster sparsity prior with the classical GoDec algorithm, incorporating the cluster sparsity prior into the S-step of GoDec. This resulted in a new hyperspectral anomaly detection method, which we called Turbo-GoDec. In this approach, we modeled the cluster sparsity prior of anomalies using a Markov random field and computed the marginal probabilities of anomalies through message passing on a factor graph. Locations with high anomalous probabilities were treated as the sparse component in the Turbo-GoDec. Experiments are conducted on three real hyperspectral image (HSI) datasets which demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Turbo-GoDec method in detecting small-size anomalies comparing with the vanilla GoDec (LSMAD) and state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods.

To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size.

However, a limitation of these approaches is their dependence on high-resolution input images to achieve optimal performance, which results in considerable computational overhead. In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark.

At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities. The experimental results on HateXplain data show a clear improvement in detection performance, explainability and a reduction in unintentional bias."}

The model employs an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and uses two spherical meshes with different resolutions to better capture the multi-scale nature of ocean dynamics.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

HSC emphasizes active participation both within the internal reasoning process and in interactions with the environment, where actions are used not only to achieve goals but also to automatically refine and improve internal reasoning mechanisms without external intervention. Furthermore, HSC incorporates commonly used human thinking strategies across all stages of the internal reasoning process, such as main-feature-oriented reasoning, scope expansion through action, and on-time learning driven by environmental feedback. Through theoretical analysis, we argue that human simulation strategies cannot be fully learned from language material alone, and that human-like reasoning processes and action-grounded reasoning methods are essential for robust adaptation and effective interaction with real-world environments."}

These models have demonstrated remarkable real world generalization due to significant model capacity and largescale datasets. However, current crop segmentation models mostly learn from limited data due to expensive pixel-level labelling cost, often performing well only under specific crop types or controlled environment. In this work, we follow the vein of our previous work DepthCropSeg, an almost unsupervised approach to crop segmentation, to scale up a cross-species and crossscene crop segmentation dataset, with 28,406 images across 30+ species and 15 environmental conditions. We also build upon a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation architecture ViT-Adapter architecture, enhance it with dynamic upsampling for improved detail awareness, and train the model with a two-stage selftraining pipeline. To systematically validate model performance, we conduct comprehensive experiments to justify the effectiveness and generalization capabilities across multiple crop datasets. Results demonstrate that DepthCropSeg++ achieves 93.11% mIoU on a comprehensive testing set, outperforming both supervised baselines and general-purpose vision foundation models like Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) by significant margins (+0.36% and +48.57% respectively).

While instruction tuning is the prevailing method for adapting pre-trained LLMs to graph learning tasks like node classification, it requires a substantial volume of annotated (INSTRUCTION, OUTPUT) pairs deriving from labeled nodes. This requirement is particularly prohibitive in the social domain, where obtaining expert labels for sensitive or evolving content is costly and slow. Furthermore, standard graph instruction tuning fails to exploit the vast amount of unlabeled nodes, which contain latent correlations due to edge connections that are beneficial for downstream predictions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Instruction Tuning pipeline for Graph Learning, named SIT-Graph. Notably, SIT-Graph is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into any graph instruction tuning method that utilizes LLMs as the predictor. SIT-Graph operates via an iterative self-training process. Initially, the model is fine-tuned using instruction pairs constructed solely from the labeled nodes. Then it generates confidence-filtered pseudo-responses for unlabeled nodes to strategically augment the dataset for the next round of fine-tuning. Finally, this iterative refinement progressively aligns the LLM with the underlying node correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when incorporated into state-of-the-art graph instruction tuning methods, SIT-Graph significantly enhances their performance on text-attributed graph benchmarks, achieving over 20% improvement under the low label ratio settings."}

To address these issues, we present PREFAB, a low-budget retrospective self-annotation method that targets affective inflection regions rather than full annotation. Grounded in the peak-end rule and ordinal representations of emotion, PREFAB employs a preference-learning model to detect relative affective changes, directing annotators to label only selected segments while interpolating the remainder of the stimulus. We further introduce a preview mechanism that provides brief contextual cues to assist annotation. We evaluate PREFAB through a technical performance study and a 25-participant user study.

This approach unifies natural gradient descent with orthogonal gradient methods within an information-geometric framework. The resulting update direction is invariant under reparameterization, guarantees descent in the Fisher metric, and helps preserve prior task outputs. We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100."}

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

As a type of real-world data, the high-dimensional spectra in hyperspectral images are actually determined by only a few factors, such as chemical composition and illumination. Thus, spectra in hyperspectral images are highly likely to satisfy the manifold hypothesis. Based on the hyperspectral manifold hypothesis, we propose a novel hyperspectral anomaly detection method (named ScoreAD) that leverages the time-dependent gradient field of the data distribution (i.e., the score), as learned by a score-based generative model (SGM). Our method first trains the SGM on the entire set of spectra from the hyperspectral image. At test time, each spectrum is passed through a perturbation kernel, and the resulting perturbed spectrum is fed into the trained SGM to obtain the estimated score. The manifold hypothesis of HSIs posits that background spectra reside on one or more low-dimensional manifolds. Conversely, anomalous spectra, owing to their unique spectral signatures, are considered outliers that do not conform to the background manifold. Based on this fundamental discrepancy in their manifold distributions, we leverage a generative SGM to achieve hyperspectral anomaly detection. Experiments on the four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jiahuisheng/ScoreAD."}

This paper introduces the Simplification Profiler, a diagnostic toolkit that generates a multidimensional, interpretable fingerprint of simplified texts. Multiple aggregated simplifications of a model result in a model's fingerprint. This novel evaluation paradigm is particularly vital for languages, where the data scarcity problem is magnified when creating flexible models for diverse target groups rather than a single, fixed simplification style. We propose that measuring a model's unique behavioral signature is more relevant in this context as an alternative to correlating metrics with human preferences. We operationalize this with a practical meta-evaluation of our fingerprints' descriptive power, which bypasses the need for large, human-rated datasets. This test measures if a simple linear classifier can reliably identify various model configurations by their created simplifications, confirming that our metrics are sensitive to a model's specific characteristics. The Profiler can distinguish high-level behavioral variations between prompting strategies and fine-grained changes from prompt engineering, including few-shot examples. Our complete feature set achieves classification F1-scores up to 71.9 %, improving upon simple baselines by over 48 percentage points. The Simplification Profiler thus offers developers a granular, actionable analysis to build more effective and truly adaptive text simplification systems."}

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they struggle to internalize multi hop, logic driven motifs such as fund dispersal and layering that characterize sophisticated money laundering, limiting their forensic accountability under regulations like the FATF Travel Rule. To address this limitation, we propose Relational Domain Logic Integration (RDLI), a framework that embeds expert derived heuristics as differentiable, logic aware latent signals within representation learning. Unlike static rule based approaches, RDLI enables the detection of complex transactional flows that evade standard message passing. To further account for market volatility, we incorporate a Retrieval Grounded Context (RGC) module that conditions anomaly scoring on regulatory and macroeconomic context, mitigating false positives caused by benign regime shifts. Under extreme label scarcity (0.01%), RDLI outperforms state of the art GNN baselines by 28.9% in F1 score. A micro expert user study further confirms that RDLI path level explanations significantly improve trustworthiness, perceived usefulness, and clarity compared to existing methods, highlighting the importance of integrating domain logic with contextual grounding for both accuracy and explainability."}

This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system.

However, current benchmarks in dermatology often reduce the complex diagnostic taxonomy to flat, binary classification tasks, such as distinguishing melanoma from benign nevi. This oversimplification obscures a model's ability to perform fine-grained differential diagnoses, which is critical for clinical workflow integration. This study evaluates the utility of embeddings derived from ten foundation models, spanning general computer vision, general medical imaging, and dermatology-specific domains, for hierarchical skin lesion classification. Using the DERM12345 dataset, which comprises 40 lesion subclasses, we calculated frozen embeddings and trained lightweight adapter models using a five-fold cross-validation. We introduce a hierarchical evaluation framework that assesses performance across four levels of clinical granularity: 40 Subclasses, 15 Main Classes, 2 and 4 Superclasses, and Binary Malignancy. Our results reveal a \"granularity gap\" in model capabilities: MedImageInsights achieved the strongest overall performance (97.52% weighted F1-Score on Binary Malignancy detection) but declined to 65.50% on fine-grained 40-class subtype classification. Conversely, MedSigLip (69.79%) and dermatology-specific models (Derm Foundation and MONET) excelled at fine-grained 40-class subtype discrimination while achieving lower overall performance than MedImageInsights on broader classification tasks. Our findings suggest that while general medical foundation models are highly effective for high-level screening, specialized modeling strategies are necessary for the granular distinctions required in diagnostic support systems."}

From subcellular chemical networks to swarms of organisms, and across evolved, engineered, and chimeric systems, it is hypothesized that scale-invariant principles of decision-making can be discovered. We propose that cognition in both natural and synthetic systems can be characterized and understood by the interplay between two equally important invariants: (1) the remapping of embedding spaces, and (2) the navigation within these spaces. Biological collectives, from single cells to entire organisms (and beyond), remap transcriptional, morphological, physiological, or 3D spaces to maintain homeostasis and regenerate structure, while navigating these spaces through distributed error correction. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, including transformers, diffusion models, and neural cellular automata enact analogous processes by remapping data into latent embeddings and refining them iteratively through contextualization. We argue that this dual principle - remapping and navigation of embedding spaces via iterative error minimization - constitutes a substrate-independent invariant of cognition. Recognizing this shared mechanism not only illuminates deep parallels between living systems and artificial models, but also provides a unifying framework for engineering adaptive intelligence across scales."}

Using object size or latent feature, they then retrieve objects from a predefined database. For complex scenes of varied, multi-categorical objects, diffusion-based latents cannot be effectively decoded by current autoencoders into the correct point cloud objects which agree with target classes. We introduce a Class-Partitioned Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CPVQ-VAE) that is trained to effectively decode object latent features, by employing a pioneering $\\textit{class-partitioned codebook}$ where codevectors are labeled by class. To address the problem of $\\textit{codebook collapse}$, we propose a $\\textit{class-aware}$ running average update which reinitializes dead codevectors within each partition. During inference, object features and class labels, both generated by a Latent-space Flow Matching Model (LFMM) designed specifically for scene generation, are consumed by the CPVQ-VAE. The CPVQ-VAE's class-aware inverse look-up then maps generated latents to codebook entries that are decoded to class-specific point cloud shapes. Thereby, we achieve pure point cloud generation without relying on an external objects database for retrieval. Extensive experiments reveal that our method reliably recovers plausible point cloud scenes, with up to 70.4% and 72.3% reduction in Chamfer and Point2Mesh errors on complex living room scenes."}

Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

In such systems, evaluating long-run performance measures typically relies on costly simulation.\n  This paper proposes a supervised learning framework via a neural network model for approximating stationary performance measures of (s,S) inventory systems with general distributions for the interarrival time between demands and lead times under lost sales. Simulations are first used to generate training labels, after which the neural network is trained. After training, the neural network provides almost instantaneous predictions of various metrics of the system, such as the stationary distribution of inventory levels, the expected cycle time, and the probability of lost sales. We find that using a small number of low-order moments of the distributions as input is sufficient to train the neural networks and to accurately capture the steady-state distribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate high accuracy over a wide range of system parameters. As such, it effectively replaces repeated and costly simulation runs. Our framework is easily extendable to other inventory models, offering an efficient and fast alternative for analyzing complex stochastic systems."}

This lack of transparency fosters blind trust, even as models produce unstable or repetitive outputs. We introduce an interactive demo that surfaces and mitigates cognitive fatigue, a failure mode where LLMs gradually lose coherence during auto-regressive generation. Our system, Chatsparent, instruments real-time, token-level signals of fatigue, including attention-to-prompt decay, embedding drift, and entropy collapse, and visualizes them as a unified fatigue index. When fatigue thresholds are crossed, the interface allows users to activate lightweight interventions such as attention resets, entropy-regularized decoding, and self-reflection checkpoints. The demo streams live text and fatigue signals, allowing users to observe when fatigue arises, how it affects output quality, and how interventions restore stability. By turning passive chatbot interaction into an interactive diagnostic experience, our system empowers users to better understand LLM behavior while improving reliability at inference time."}

Existing solutions use RGB cameras to annotate skeletal keypoints, but their performance declines in dark environments and raises privacy concerns, limiting their use in smart homes and hospitals. This paper explores non-invasive wireless sensors, i.e., LiDAR and mmWave, to mitigate these challenges as a feasible alternative. Two problems are addressed: (1) insufficient data on wireless sensor modality to train an accurate skeleton estimation model, and (2) skeletal keypoints derived from wireless sensors are noisier than RGB, causing great difficulties for subsequent action recognition models. Our work, SkeFi, overcomes these gaps through a novel cross-modal knowledge transfer method acquired from the data-rich RGB modality. We propose the enhanced Temporal Correlation Adaptive Graph Convolution (TC-AGC) with frame interactive enhancement to overcome the noise from missing or inconsecutive frames. Additionally, our research underscores the effectiveness of enhancing multiscale temporal modeling through dual temporal convolution. By integrating TC-AGC with temporal modeling for cross-modal transfer, our framework can extract accurate poses and actions from noisy wireless sensors.

These attacks could compromise model performance and system security in cross-modal tasks. To address this challenge, three main defense paradigms have been proposed: Training-time Defense, Test-time Adaptation Defense, and Training-free Defense. Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training. This survey reviews the latest advancements in adversarial defense strategies for VLMs, highlighting the strengths and limitations of such approaches and discussing ongoing challenges in enhancing the robustness of VLMs."}

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

We propose CooperLLM, a cloud-assisted edge-end cooperative federated fine-tuning framework that combines ZOO on mobile devices with cloud-guided gradient rectification. Mobile clients perform lightweight ZOO updates on private data, while the cloud fine-tunes on auxiliary public data using backpropagation and injects guided perturbations to rectify local updates, improving convergence and accuracy without violating privacy.

To address these limitations, we developed a large-scale, multi-source benchmark for multi-organelle instance segmentation, comprising over 100,000 2D EM images across variety cell types and five organelle classes that capture real-world variability. Dataset annotations were generated by our designed connectivity-aware Label Propagation Algorithm (3D LPA) with expert refinement.

Our results show several limitations: current models struggle to generalize across heterogeneous EM data and perform poorly on organelles with global, distributed morphologies (e.g., Endoplasmic Reticulum). These findings underscore the fundamental mismatch between local-context models and the challenge of modeling long-range structural continuity in the presence of real-world variability. The benchmark dataset and labeling tool will be publicly released soon."}

Our novel benchmark PMR-Bench contains 1569 unique messages and 2,000+ high-quality test pairs for pairwise medical urgency assessment alongside a scalable training data generation pipeline.

It has a high global prevalence and places a significant burden on healthcare systems, especially in resource-limited regions. Automated classification of sickle cells in blood images is crucial, allowing the specialist to reduce the effort required and avoid errors when quantifying the deformed cells and assessing the severity of a crisis. Recent studies have proposed various erythrocyte representation and classification methods. Since classification depends solely on cell shape, a suitable approach models erythrocytes as closed planar curves in shape space. This approach employs elastic distances between shapes, which are invariant under rotations, translations, scaling, and reparameterizations, ensuring consistent distance measurements regardless of the curves' position, starting point, or traversal speed. While previous methods exploiting shape space distances had achieved high accuracy, we refined the model by considering the geometric characteristics of healthy and sickled erythrocytes. Our method proposes (1) to employ a fixed parameterization based on the major axis of each cell to compute distances and (2) to align each cell with two templates using this parameterization before computing distances. Aligning shapes to templates before distance computation, a concept successfully applied in areas such as molecular dynamics, and using a fixed parameterization, instead of minimizing distances across all possible parameterizations, simplifies calculations. This strategy achieves 96.03\\% accuracy rate in both supervised classification and unsupervised clustering.

To address this, we introduce OpenExempt, a framework and benchmark for diagnostic evaluation of legal reasoning. The OpenExempt Framework uses expert-crafted symbolic representations of U.S. Bankruptcy Code statutes to dynamically generate a large space of natural language reasoning tasks and their machine-computable solutions on demand. This gives users fine-grained control over task complexity and scope, allowing individual reasoning skills to be probed in isolation.

Building on recent work that applies OCL to OTSF, this paper aims to strengthen the theoretical and practical connections between time series methods and OCL. First, we reframe neural network optimization as a parameter filtering problem, showing that natural gradient descent is a score-driven method and proving its information-theoretic optimality. Then, we show that using a Student's t likelihood in addition to natural gradient induces a bounded update, which improves robustness to outliers.

In contrast to human hairstyle reconstruction, there are also no datasets that can be leveraged to learn a fur prior for different animals. In this work, we present a first multi-view-based method for high-fidelity 3D fur modeling of animals using a strand-based representation, leveraging the general knowledge of a vision language model. Given multi-view RGB images, we first reconstruct a coarse surface geometry using traditional multi-view stereo techniques. We then use a vision language model (VLM) system to retrieve information about the realistic length structure of the fur for each part of the body. We use this knowledge to construct the animal's furless geometry and grow strands atop it. The fur reconstruction is supervised with both geometric and photometric losses computed from multi-view images. To mitigate orientation ambiguities stemming from the Gabor filters that are applied to the input images, we additionally utilize the VLM to guide the strands' growth direction and their relation to the gravity vector that we incorporate as a loss. With this new schema of using a VLM to guide 3D reconstruction from multi-view inputs, we show generalization across a variety of animals with different fur types.

This structure limits the model's ability to represent a more general relationship between the spatial variable and the noise, indicating that it cannot fully learn the correct score. Despite this limitation, the models perform well in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by studying the deterministic dynamics of the associated differential equations, offering insight into how the model operates."}

To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding. This work offers a unified approach for a flexible, efficient, and novel language modeling paradigm."}

In this work, we study PINN training from a unified architecture-optimization perspective. We first propose a layer-wise dynamic attention mechanism to enhance representational flexibility, resulting in the Layer-wise Dynamic Attention PINN (LDA-PINN). We then reformulate PINN training as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a conflict-resolved gradient update strategy to alleviate gradient interference, leading to the Gradient-Conflict-Resolved PINN (GC-PINN). By integrating these two components, we develop the Architecture-Conflict-Resolved PINN (ACR-PINN), which combines attentive representations with conflict-aware optimization while preserving the standard PINN loss formulation. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs, including the Burgers, Helmholtz, Klein-Gordon, and lid-driven cavity flow problems, demonstrate that ACR-PINN achieves faster convergence and significantly lower relative $L_2$ and $L_\\infty$ errors than standard PINNs. These results highlight the effectiveness of architecture-optimization co-design for improving the robustness and accuracy of PINN-based solvers."}

To address this limitation, we propose a flexible solution using moving drones to capture videos and perform video-level crowd counting and tracking of unique pedestrians across entire scenes. We introduce MovingDroneCrowd++, the largest video-level dataset for dense crowd counting and tracking captured by moving drones, covering diverse and complex conditions with varying flight altitudes, camera angles, and illumination. Existing methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. To this end, we propose GD3A (Global Density Map Decomposition via Descriptor Association), a density map-based video individual counting method that avoids explicit localization. GD3A establishes pixel-level correspondences between pedestrian descriptors across consecutive frames via optimal transport with an adaptive dustbin score, enabling the decomposition of global density maps into shared, inflow, and outflow components. Building on this framework, we further introduce DVTrack, which converts descriptor-level matching into instance-level associations through a descriptor voting mechanism for pedestrian tracking. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform existing approaches under dense crowds and complex motion, reducing counting error by 47.4 percent and improving tracking performance by 39.2 percent."}

Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability."}

Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models."}

Twenty-four students completed two brief cognitive-behavioural role-plays (counterbalanced), one with each tool, and provided both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on perceived usefulness, skill application, responsiveness and engagement, and perceived skill improvement. Both AI tools were evaluated positively across dimensions.

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts.

We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

Classic techniques offer precise and rapid deformation control. However, they solve an optimization problem with constraints defined by control handle placement, requiring a user to know apriori the ideal distribution of handles on the shape to accomplish the desired edit. The mapping from handle set to deformation behavior is often unintuitive and, importantly, non-semantic. Modern data-driven methods, on the other hand, leverage a data prior to obtain semantic edits, but are slow and imprecise. We propose a technique that fuses the semantic prior of data with the precise control and speed of traditional frameworks. Our approach is surprisingly simple yet effective: deep feature proximity makes for smooth and semantic deformation weights, with no need for additional regularization. The weights can be computed in real-time for any surface point, whereas prior methods require optimization for new handles. Moreover, the semantic prior from deep features enables co-deformation of semantic parts. We introduce an improved feature distillation pipeline, barycentric feature distillation, which efficiently uses the visual signal from shape renders to minimize distillation cost. This allows our weights to be computed for high resolution meshes in under a minute, in contrast to potentially hours for both classical and neural methods. We preserve and extend properties of classical methods through feature space constraints and locality weighting. Our field representation allows for automatic detection of semantic symmetries, which we use to produce symmetry-preserving deformations. We show a proof-of-concept application which can produce deformations for meshes up to 1 million faces in real-time on a consumer-grade machine."}

This study investigates the quality of feedback generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), compared with human feedback, in three computer science course with technical writing components: an introductory computer science course (CS2), a third-year advanced systems course (operating systems), and a third-year writing course (a topics course on artificial intelligence). Using a mixed-methods approach which integrates quantitative Likert-scale questions with qualitative commentary, we analyze the student perspective on feedback quality, evaluated based on multiple criteria, including readability, detail, specificity, actionability, helpfulness, and overall quality. The analysis reveals that in the larger upper-year operating systems course ($N=80$), SLMs and LLMs are perceived to deliver clear, actionable, and well-structured feedback, while humans provide more contextually nuanced guidance. As for the high-enrollment CS2 course ($N=176$) showed the same preference for the AI tools' clarity and breadth, but students noted that AI feedback sometimes lacked the concise, straight-to-the-point, guidance offered by humans. Conversely, in the smaller upper-year technical writing course on AI topics ($N=7$), all students preferred feedback from the course instructor, who was able to provide clear, specific, and personalized feedback, compared to the more general and less targeted AI-based feedback. We also highlight the scalability of AI-based feedback by focusing on its effectiveness at large scale. Our findings underscore the potential of hybrid approaches that combine AI and human feedback to achieve efficient and high-quality feedback at scale."}

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system."}

We frame classification as representation selection over the full token-layer hidden-state tensor, rather than committing to a fixed token or fixed layer (e.g., first-token logits or final-layer pooling). To implement this, we introduce a two-stage aggregator that (i) summarizes tokens within each layer and (ii) aggregates across layer summaries to form a single representation for classification. We instantiate this template with direct pooling, a 100K-parameter scoring-attention gate, and a downcast multi-head self-attention (MHA) probe with up to 35M trainable parameters. Across safety and sentiment benchmarks our probes improve over logit-only reuse (e.g., MULI) and are competitive with substantially larger task-specific baselines, while preserving near-serving latency and avoiding the VRAM and latency costs of a separate guard-model pipeline."}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry."}

We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis.

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments."}

However, the mathematical behavior of recursive or multi-generation distillation remains poorly understood, with prior approaches relying primarily on empirical heuristics. In this work, we introduce an axiomatic and operator-theoretic framework for recursive meta-distillation, formalizing iterative knowledge distillation as a sequence of probability-distribution operators with explicit anchoring to base teachers.\n  We define structural axioms for valid meta-teacher construction and prove the existence of non-trivial operator families satisfying these axioms without specifying particular algorithms or loss functions. Under mild realizability and convexity assumptions, we show that anchored recursive distillation induces contraction in KL divergence, yielding geometric convergence to base teacher distributions and a unique, globally attractive fixed point.\n  The contribution is foundational rather than algorithmic: the framework characterizes when recursive distillation is mathematically well-posed and convergent rather than error-accumulating, independent of model architecture, optimization details, or specific operator instantiations. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding stability, bias-variance behavior, and failure modes in iterative and multi-teacher distillation under capacity constraints."}

While token pruning has been actively explored in standard large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (LVLMs), its application to AV-LLMs has received little attention, even though multimodal integration substantially increases their token demands. To address this gap, we introduce a pruning strategy that utilizes attention weights to identify tokens emphasized at different stages and estimates their importance. Building on this analysis, FastAV applies a two-stage pruning strategy: (1) global pruning in intermediate layers to remove broadly less influential tokens, and (2) fine pruning in later layers considering the impact on next token generation. Notably, our method does not rely on full attention maps, which makes it fully compatible with efficient attention mechanisms such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastAV reduces FLOPs by more than 40% on two representative AV-LLMs, while preserving or even improving model performance."}

Compass-Embedding v4 addresses three core challenges. First, large-batch contrastive training under mixed task supervision introduces systematic false negatives that degrade semantic alignment. We propose Class-Aware Masking (CAM), a lightweight modification to the InfoNCE objective that suppresses invalid in-batch negatives and improves semantic discrimination without altering training efficiency. Second, low-resource SEA languages suffer from limited and uneven data coverage. We construct a diversified training corpus through context-grounded synthetic data generation, cross-lingual translation, and structured e-commerce data construction, enabling robust multilingual and domain-specific learning. Third, production deployment requires high-throughput inference while preserving embedding quality.

We postulate that visual/geometrical and textual representations of spatial structure must be combined at some point in VLM computations. We search for such confluence, and ask whether the identified representation can causally explain aspects of input-output model behavior through a linear model. We show empirically that VLMs encode object locations by linearly binding \\textit{spatial IDs} to textual activations, then perform reasoning via language tokens. Through rigorous causal interventions we demonstrate that these IDs, which are ubiquitous across the model, can systematically mediate model beliefs at intermediate VLM layers. Additionally, we find that spatial IDs serve as a diagnostic tool for identifying limitations in existing VLMs, and as a valuable learning signal. We extend our analysis to video VLMs and identify an analogous linear temporal ID mechanism. By characterizing our proposed spatiotemporal ID mechanism, we elucidate a previously underexplored internal reasoning process in VLMs, toward improved interpretability and the principled design of more aligned and capable models.

In this paper we analyze the tokenizers of ten popular LMs to better understand their designs and per-language tokenization premiums. We also propose a mechanism to reduce tokenization premiums in pre-trained models, by post-hoc additions to the token vocabulary that coalesce multi-token characters into single tokens.

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

The advent of AI unlocks new possibilities in facilitating this activity. We present RegCheck, a modular LLM-assisted tool designed to help researchers, reviewers, and editors from across scientific disciplines compare study registrations with their corresponding papers.

Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively."}

To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models. Our approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance between predictive quality and calibration, demonstrated by strong performance on both Negative Log-Likelihood and Expected Calibration Error."}

However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance. The RAG + multi-agent GPT-4o mini configuration achieves a +15.51% coverage gain over zero-shot baselines, while the Llama 3 8B multi-agent setup yields a +4.41% improvement."}

Existing solutions including safety-critical scenario generation and closed-loop learning often rely on rule-based heuristics, resampling methods and generative models learned from offline datasets, limiting their ability to produce diverse and novel challenges. While recent works leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce scene descriptions that guide a separate, downstream model in generating hazardous trajectories for agents, such two-stage framework constrains the generative potential of VLMs, as the diversity of the final trajectories is ultimately limited by the generalization ceiling of the downstream algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VILTA (VLM-In-the-Loop Trajectory Adversary), a novel framework that integrates a VLM into the closed-loop training of AD agents. Unlike prior works, VILTA actively participates in the training loop by comprehending the dynamic driving environment and strategically generating challenging scenarios through direct, fine-grained editing of surrounding agents' future trajectories. This direct-editing approach fully leverages the VLM's powerful generalization capabilities to create a diverse curriculum of plausible yet challenging scenarios that extend beyond the scope of traditional methods. We demonstrate that our approach substantially enhances the safety and robustness of the resulting AD policy, particularly in its ability to navigate critical long-tail events."}

Despite strong performance, existing confidence estimation methods typically reduce an entire reasoning process to a single scalar score, ignoring how confidence evolves throughout the generation. As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks.

In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities. Our method preserves RLVR's accuracy level while mitigating overconfidence, reducing ECE scores up to 9 points."}

To suppress thermal radiation and heat haze using fusion-restoration image processing methods, thereby improving the accuracy and effectiveness of DIC in the measurement of high-temperature deformation. For image degradation caused by thermal radiation, based on the image layered representation, the image is decomposed into positive and negative channels for parallel processing, and then optimized for quality by multi-exposure image fusion. To counteract the high-frequency, random errors introduced by heat haze, we adopt the FSIM as the objective function to guide the iterative optimization of model parameters, and the grayscale average algorithm is applied to equalize anomalous gray values, thereby reducing measurement error. The proposed multi-exposure image fusion algorithm effectively suppresses image degradation caused by complex illumination conditions, boosting the effective computation area from 26% to 50% for under-exposed images and from 32% to 40% for over-exposed images without degrading measurement accuracy in the experiment. Meanwhile, the image restoration combined with the grayscale average algorithm reduces static thermal deformation measurement errors. The error in ε_xx is reduced by 85.3%, while the errors in ε_yy and γ_xy are reduced by 36.0% and 36.4%, respectively.

Most individual-level SDOH data is collected through structured screening tools, which lack the flexibility to capture the complexity of patient experiences and unique needs of a clinic's population. This study explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract structured SDOH information from unstructured patient life stories and evaluate the predictive value of both the extracted features and the narratives themselves for assessing diabetes control. We collected unstructured interviews from 65 T2D patients aged 65 and older, focused on their lived experiences, social context, and diabetes management. These narratives were analyzed using LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation to produce concise, actionable qualitative summaries for clinical interpretation and structured quantitative SDOH ratings for risk prediction modeling. The structured SDOH ratings were used independently and in combination with traditional laboratory biomarkers as inputs to linear and tree-based machine learning models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to demonstrate how unstructured narrative data can be applied in conventional risk prediction workflows. Finally, we evaluated several LLMs on their ability to predict a patient's level of diabetes control (low, medium, high) directly from interview text with A1C values redacted. LLMs achieved 60% accuracy in predicting diabetes control levels from interview text. This work demonstrates how LLMs can translate unstructured SDOH-related data into structured insights, offering a scalable approach to augment clinical risk models and decision-making."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

To this end, we propose an online boundary trimming method, GaussianTrimmer, which is an efficient and plug-and-play post-processing method capable of trimming coarse boundaries for existing 3D Gaussian segmentation methods.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes \"Bit-politeia\", an AI agent community on blockchain designed to construct a fair, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation system. In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a \"clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture\" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms. Agents engage through casual chat and deliberative interactions to evaluate research outputs and distribute a virtual currency as rewards. This incentive mechanism aims to achieve incentive compatibility through consensus-driven evaluation, while blockchain technology ensures immutable records of all transactions and reputation data. By leveraging AI for objective assessment and decentralized verification, Bit-politeia minimizes human bias and mitigates resource centralization issues found in traditional peer review. The proposed framework provides a novel pathway for optimizing scientific innovation through a fair and automated resource configuration process."}

Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar."}

To evaluate the generated videos, we design an assessment pipeline that performs automated checks across 15 quantitative parameters and incorporates feedback from a vision-language model (VLM) to iteratively improve video quality.

Our results reveal systematic differences in video quality depending on problem difficulty and whether the task is numerical or theoretical. Using GPT-5-mini, PSA achieves a 100% video-completion rate with an average automated score of 3.8/5. However, qualitative analysis and human inspection uncover both minor and major issues, including visual layout inconsistencies and errors in how visual content is interpreted during feedback. These findings expose key limitations in reliable Manim code generation and highlight broader challenges in multimodal reasoning and evaluation for visual explanations of numerical physics problems.

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

Anonpsy (1) converts each narrative into a semantic graph encoding clinical entities, temporal anchors, and typed relations; (2) applies graph-constrained perturbations that modify identifying context while preserving clinically essential structure; and (3) regenerates text via graph-conditioned LLM generation. Evaluated on 90 clinician-authored psychiatric case narratives, Anonpsy preserves diagnostic fidelity while achieving consistently low re-identification risk under expert, semantic, and GPT-5-based evaluations. Compared with a strong LLM-only rewriting baseline, Anonpsy yields substantially lower semantic similarity and identifiability. These results demonstrate that explicit structural representations combined with constrained generation provide an effective approach to de-identification for psychiatric narratives."}

PLA-Serve disaggregates multi-turn long-prefill requests from short-prefill ones and introduces a length-aware smart batching mechanism for short-prefill workloads. It adopts a dual-queue design that supports temporal disaggregation on a single prefill instance or spatial disaggregation across multiple instances.

While visual foundation models (VFMs) provide strong local features, most existing methods rely on a single model, overlooking the complementary cues offered by different VFMs. However, exploiting such complementary information inevitably alters token distributions, which challenges the stability of existing query-based global aggregation schemes. To address these challenges, we propose DC-VLAQ, a representation-centric framework that integrates the fusion of complementary VFMs and robust global aggregation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight residual-guided complementary fusion that anchors representations in the DINOv2 feature space while injecting complementary semantics from CLIP through a learned residual correction. In addition, we propose the Vector of Local Aggregated Queries (VLAQ), a query--residual global aggregation scheme that encodes local tokens by their residual responses to learnable queries, resulting in improved stability and the preservation of fine-grained discriminative cues. Extensive experiments on standard VPR benchmarks, including Pitts30k, Tokyo24/7, MSLS, Nordland, SPED, and AmsterTime, demonstrate that DC-VLAQ consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under challenging domain shifts and long-term appearance changes."}

Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks. We design symmetric prompts using predicate-positive and predicate-negative constructions and demonstrate that such framing induces significant discrepancies in model outputs. Across 14 LLM judges, we observe clear susceptibility to framing, with model families showing distinct tendencies toward agreement or rejection. These findings suggest that framing bias is a structural property of current LLM-based evaluation systems, underscoring the need for framing-aware protocols."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

However, existing multimodal inference systems typically employ monolithic architectures that tightly couple the Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages on homogeneous hardware, neglecting the heterogeneous computational characteristics of each stage. This design leads to inefficient resource utilization and limited system throughput. To address these issues, we propose EPD-Serve, a stage-level disaggregated inference serving system for multimodal models. EPD-Serve decouples the inference pipeline into independent Encode, Prefill, and Decode stages, enabling logical isolation and flexible co-located deployment through dynamic orchestration. Leveraging the Ascend interconnect topology, EPD-Serve introduces asynchronous feature prefetching between Encode and Prefill stages and a hierarchical grouped KV cache transmission mechanism between Prefill and Decode stages to improve cross-node communication efficiency. In addition, EPD-Serve incorporates multi-route scheduling, instance-level load balancing, and multi-stage hardware co-location with spatial multiplexing to better support diverse multimodal workloads. Comprehensive experiments on multimodal understanding models demonstrate that, under high-concurrency scenarios, EPD-Serve improves end-to-end throughput by 57.37-69.48% compared to PD-disaggregated deployment, while satisfying strict SLO constraints, including TTFT below 2000 ms and TPOT below 50 ms.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Self-Supervised Pretrained Transformer (SSPFormer) for MRI images, which effectively learns domain-specific feature representations of medical images by leveraging unlabeled raw imaging data. To tackle the domain gap and data scarcity, we introduce inverse frequency projection masking, which prioritizes the reconstruction of high-frequency anatomical regions to enforce structure-aware representation learning. Simultaneously, to enhance robustness against real-world MRI artifacts, we employ frequency-weighted FFT noise enhancement that injects physiologically realistic noise into the Fourier domain. Together, these strategies enable the model to learn domain-invariant and artifact-robust features directly from raw scans. Through extensive experiments on segmentation, super-resolution, and denoising tasks, the proposed SSPFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, fully verifying its ability to capture fine-grained MRI image fidelity and adapt to clinical application requirements."}

The proposed method leverages a continuous signed distance function (SDF) representation to reconstruct and generate smooth, watertight geometries with quantified accuracy. It establishes an interpretable, near-Gaussian latent space that aligns with blade-relevant parameters, such as taper and chord ratios, enabling controlled exploration and unconditional synthesis through interpolation and Gaussian sampling.

Motivated by these findings, we investigate whether supervised training can more fully harness the tracking capability of video diffusion models. To this end, we propose Moaw, a framework that unleashes motion awareness for video diffusion models and leverages it to facilitate motion transfer. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for motion perception, shifting its modality from image-to-video generation to video-to-dense-tracking. We then construct a motion-labeled dataset to identify features that encode the strongest motion information, and inject them into a structurally identical video generation model. Owing to the homogeneity between the two networks, these features can be naturally adapted in a zero-shot manner, enabling motion transfer without additional adapters. Our work provides a new paradigm for bridging generative modeling and motion understanding, paving the way for more unified and controllable video learning frameworks."}

Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion.

We present Spatial-VLN, a perception-guided exploration framework designed to overcome these challenges. The framework consists of two main modules. The Spatial Perception Enhancement (SPE) module integrates panoramic filtering with specialized door and region experts to produce spatially coherent, cross-view consistent perceptual representations.

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

Building on this separability, we propose Activation-space Anchored Access Control (AAAC), a training-free framework for multi-class permission control. AAAC constructs an anchor bank, with one permission anchor per class, from a small offline sample set and requires no fine-tuning. At inference time, a multi-anchor steering mechanism redirects each query's activations toward the anchor-defined authorized region associated with the current user, thereby suppressing over-privileged generations by design.

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior.

Probe families induce an operational equivalence relation on kernels and therefore a gauge; anchors select representatives relative to that probe. Under a scalar relational-work representation and a multiplicative compositionality law for evidence, the admissible link family is exponential, yielding Gibbs weights; with row anchoring this includes the softmax kernel family as a subregime. After quotienting unary row/column score fields, the remaining interaction component admits a canonical rank-r normal form (Eckart-Young/SVD); dot-product score charts implement the corresponding low-rank interaction regime. Fixing the carrier and extensionalizing the update yields the standard fixed-token Transformer attention operator; allowing carrier updates yields adaptive-carrier and staged-depth regimes. The operator language also supports multihead/mixed kernels, plan-based anchors (e.g., entropic OT/Sinkhorn), and unary operators (e.g., FFN-style fields) as explicit regime choices.

The challenge is that a panoptic segmentation system trained on a particular dataset typically does not generalize well to unseen classes beyond the training data. In this work, we propose RetCLIP, a retrieval-augmented panoptic segmentation method that improves the performance of unseen classes. In particular, we construct a masked segment feature database using paired image-text data. At inference time, we use masked segment features from the input image as query keys to retrieve similar features and associated class labels from the database. Classification scores for the masked segment are assigned based on the similarity between query features and retrieved features. The retrieval-based classification scores are combined with CLIP-based scores to produce the final output. We incorporate our solution with a previous SOTA method (FC-CLIP). When trained on COCO, the proposed method demonstrates 30.9 PQ, 19.3 mAP, 44.0 mIoU on the ADE20k dataset, achieving +4.5 PQ, +2.5 mAP, +10.0 mIoU absolute improvement over the baseline."}

An Investigation into Language Bias of Pairwise LLM-as-a-Judge", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": null, "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have incentivized the development of LLM-as-a-judge, an application of LLMs where they are used as judges to decide the quality of a certain piece of text given a certain context. However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only."}

Among various tensor models, low-Tucker-rank tensors are particularly attractive for capturing multi-mode subspace structures in high-dimensional data. Existing recovery methods either operate on the full tensor variable with expensive tensor projections, or adopt factorized formulations that still rely on full-gradient computations, while most stochastic factorized approaches are restricted to tensor decomposition settings. In this work, we propose a stochastic alternating minimization algorithm that operates directly on the core tensor and factor matrices under a Tucker factorization. The proposed method avoids repeated tensor projections and enables efficient mini-batch updates on low-dimensional tensor factors. Numerical experiments on synthetic tensor sensing demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits favorable convergence behavior in wall-clock time compared with representative stochastic tensor recovery baselines."}

Drawing on information-theoretic principles, we develop a tokenization framework that segments Indonesian text at syllable boundaries before applying byte-pair encoding, creating a vocabulary that aligns with the language's morphophonological structure. Our approach first identifies high-frequency syllables through rule-based segmentation, then constructs a compact vocabulary of 3,500 tokens that preserves meaningful linguistic units while maintaining coverage through character-level fallback. Empirical evaluation on Indonesian Wikipedia and folklore corpora from Indonesian Culture Digital Library (PDBI) demonstrates substantial improvements over conventional tokenization methods: the syllable-based approach achieves Rényi efficiency of 0.74 compared to 0.50-0.64 for pretrained multilingual tokenizers, while maintaining higher average token lengths (3.67 characters versus 2.72 for GPT-2) despite using a vocabulary an order of magnitude smaller. These gains emerge from the method's ability to internalize character-level dependencies within syllable units, reducing the computational burden on language models while respecting Indonesian's agglutinative morphology. We call the LLM built upon this principle, TOBA LLM (Tokenisasi Optimum Berbasis Aglutinasi), the convergence of human literacy pedagogy with computational optimization principles offers a promising paradigm for developing linguistically-informed tokenization strategies, particularly for morphologically rich and underrepresented languages in natural language processing."}

Although Deep Learning (DL) effectively identifies basic interference, classifying compound interference remains difficult due to the superposition of diverse jamming sources. Existing single-domain approaches often suffer from performance degradation because transient burst signals and continuous global signals require conflicting feature extraction scales. We propose the Selective Kernel and Asymmetric convolution Network(SKANet), a cognitive deep learning framework built upon a dual-stream architecture that integrates Time-Frequency Images (TFIs) and Power Spectral Density (PSD). Distinct from conventional fusion methods that rely on static receptive fields, the proposed architecture incorporates a Multi-Branch Selective Kernel (SK) module combined with Asymmetric Convolution Blocks (ACBs). This mechanism enables the network to dynamically adjust its receptive fields, acting as an adaptive filter that simultaneously captures micro-scale transient features and macro-scale spectral trends within entangled compound signals. To complement this spatial-temporal adaptation, a Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) mechanism is integrated at the fusion stage to adaptively recalibrate the contribution of heterogeneous features from each modality. Evaluations on a dataset of 405,000 samples demonstrate that SKANet achieves an overall accuracy of 96.99\\%, exhibiting superior robustness for compound jamming classification, particularly under low Jamming-to-Noise Ratio (JNR) regimes."}

The temporal version of that task, temporal knowledge graph extraction (TKGE), involves extracting temporally grounded facts from text, represented as semantic quadruples (subject, relation, object, timestamp). Many recent systems take advantage of large language models (LLMs), which are becoming a new cornerstone of the web due to their performance on many tasks across the natural language processing (NLP) field. Despite the importance of TKGE, existing datasets for training and evaluation remain scarce, and contamination of evaluation data is an unaddressed issue, potentially inflating LLMs' perceived performance due to overlaps between training and evaluation sets. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel synthetic evaluation dataset constructed from predicted future, previously unseen temporal facts, thereby eliminating contamination and enabling robust and unbiased benchmarking. Our dataset creation involves a two-step approach: (1) Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) generates plausible future quadruples, which are subsequently filtered to adhere to the original knowledge base schema; (2) LLMs perform quadruple-to-text generation, creating semantically aligned textual descriptions. We benchmark Extract, Define and Canonicalize (EDC), a state-of-the-art LLM-based extraction framework, demonstrating that LLM performance decreases when evaluated on our dataset compared to a dataset of known facts. We publicly release our dataset consisting of 4.2K future quadruples and corresponding textual descriptions, along with the generation methodology, enabling continuous creation of unlimited future temporal datasets to serve as long-term, contamination-free benchmarks for TKGE."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

We propose a vision-based confidence estimation framework that validates VLM predictions through independent geometric verification using object detection. Unlike text-based approaches relying on self-assessment, our method fuses four signals via gradient boosting: geometric alignment between VLM claims and coordinates, spatial ambiguity from overlap, detection quality, and VLM internal uncertainty. We achieve 0.674 AUROC on BLIP-2 (34.0% improvement over text-based baselines) and 0.583 AUROC on CLIP (16.1% improvement), generalizing across generative and classification architectures. Our framework enables selective prediction: at 60% target accuracy, we achieve 61.9% coverage versus 27.6% baseline (2.2x improvement) on BLIP-2. Feature analysis reveals vision-based signals contribute 87.4% of model importance versus 12.7% from VLM confidence, validating that external geometric verification outperforms self-assessment.

To this end, we propose a noise-robust method named Jo-SNC (\\textbf{Jo}int sample selection and model regularization based on \\textbf{S}elf- and \\textbf{N}eighbor-\\textbf{C}onsistency). Specifically, we propose to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure the ``likelihood'' of a sample being clean or out-of-distribution.

We design a self-adaptive, data-driven thresholding scheme to adjust per-class selection thresholds. While clean samples undergo conventional training, detected in-distribution and out-of-distribution noisy samples are trained following partial label learning and negative learning, respectively. Finally, we advance the model performance further by proposing a triplet consistency regularization that promotes self-prediction consistency, neighbor-prediction consistency, and feature consistency. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods."}

For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task.

Inverting this linear response relationship yields the data intervention that steers the model toward a target internal configuration. We demonstrate patterning in a small language model, showing that re-weighting training data along principal susceptibility directions can accelerate or delay the formation of structure, such as the induction circuit. In a synthetic parentheses balancing task where multiple algorithms achieve perfect training accuracy, we show that patterning can select which algorithm the model learns by targeting the local learning coefficient of each solution.

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context.

Here we present LUMOS, a data-and-physics driven framework for inverse design of fluorescent molecules. LUMOS couples generator and predictor within a shared latent representation, enabling direct specification-to-molecule design and efficient exploration. Moreover, LUMOS combines neural networks with a fast time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation workflow to build a suite of complementary predictors spanning different trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and generalizability, enabling reliable property prediction across diverse scenarios. Finally, LUMOS employs a property-guided diffusion model integrated with multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, enabling de novo design and molecular optimization under multiple objectives and constraints. Across comprehensive benchmarks, LUMOS consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of accuracy, generalizability and physical plausibility for fluorescence property prediction, and demonstrates superior performance in multi-objective scaffold- and fragment-level molecular optimization. Further validation using TD-DFT and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrates that LUMOS can generate valid fluorophores that meet various target specifications.

Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition.\n  Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability.

While 3DGS has proven effective for both real-time rendering and semantic scene understanding, prior works have largely treated these tasks independently, leaving their joint consideration unexplored. Inspired by recent advances in rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression, this work integrates semantic learning into the compression pipeline to support decoder-side applications--such as scene editing and manipulation--that extend beyond traditional scene reconstruction and view synthesis. Our scheme features a lightweight implicit neural representation-based hyperprior, enabling efficient entropy coding of both color and semantic attributes while avoiding costly grid-based hyperprior as seen in many prior works. To facilitate compression and segmentation, we further develop compression-guided segmentation learning, consisting of quantization-aware training to enhance feature separability and a quality-aware weighting mechanism to suppress unreliable Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on the LERF and 3D-OVS datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces transmission cost while preserving high rendering quality and strong segmentation performance."}

Integrating edge devices into the LLM inference process via speculative decoding helps balance the workload between the edge and the cloud, while maintaining lossless prediction accuracy. In this paper, we identify and formalize two critical bottlenecks that limit the efficiency and scalability of distributed speculative LLM serving: Wasted Drafting Time and Verification Interference. To address these challenges, we propose WISP, an efficient and SLO-aware distributed LLM inference system that consists of an intelligent speculation controller, a verification time estimator, and a verification batch scheduler. These components collaboratively enhance drafting efficiency and optimize verification request scheduling on the server. Extensive numerical results show that WISP improves system capacity by up to 2.1x and 4.1x, and increases system goodput by up to 1.94x and 3.7x, compared to centralized serving and SLED, respectively."}

SDF-HOLO decouples CT and PET representation learning with dual-stream encoders and couples them through a cross-modal interaction module, allowing anatomical context to refine PET aggregation while metabolic saliency guides subtle morphological reasoning.

We investigate whether compact optical representations can serve as an efficient interface for executable semantic parsing. We present OptiSQL, a vision-driven framework that generates executable SQL directly from table images and natural language questions using compact optical tokens. OptiSQL leverages an OCR-oriented visual encoder to compress table structure and content into a small set of optical tokens and fine-tunes a pretrained decoder for SQL generation while freezing the encoder to isolate representation sufficiency. Experiments on a visualized version of Spider 2.0-Snow show that OptiSQL retains strong execution accuracy while reducing table input tokens by an order of magnitude. Robustness analyses further demonstrate that optical tokens preserve essential structural information under visual perturbations."}

This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks.

Analysis reveals that kernels display anti-clustering behavior, evolving into a learned \"active filtration\" strategy distinct from traditional h- or p-adaptivity. Effective receptive field analysis confirms that D-PARC autonomously concentrates resources in high-strain regions while coarsening focus elsewhere, mirroring adaptive refinement in computational mechanics.

Recent advancements in 3D vision, particularly learned radiance-field representations such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, have begun to raise the ceiling on reconstruction fidelity and densifiable geometry from posed imagery. Nevertheless, direct aerial measurement of important natural attributes such as tree diameter at breast height (DBH) remains challenging. Trunks in aerial forest scans are distant and sparsely observed in image views: at typical operating altitudes, stems may span only a few pixels. With these constraints, conventional reconstruction methods leave breast-height trunk geometry weakly constrained. We present TreeDGS, an aerial image reconstruction method that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as a continuous, densifiable scene representation for trunk measurement. After SfM-MVS initialization and Gaussian optimization, we extract a dense point set from the Gaussian field using RaDe-GS's depth-aware cumulative-opacity integration and associate each sample with a multi-view opacity reliability score. We then estimate DBH from trunk-isolated points using opacity-weighted solid-circle fitting. Evaluated on 10 plots with field-measured DBH, TreeDGS reaches 4.79,cm RMSE (about 2.6 pixels at this GSD) and outperforms a state-of-the-art LiDAR baseline (7.91,cm RMSE), demonstrating that densified splat-based geometry can enable accurate, low-cost aerial DBH measurement."}

By combining the flexibility of deep learning with the principled dynamical structure of SSMs, recent studies have achieved powerful fits to functional neuroimaging data. However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior. To this end, we introduce GeoDynamics, a geometric state-space neural network that tracks latent brain-state trajectories directly on the high-dimensional SPD manifold. GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism. Beyond neuroscience, we validate GeoDynamics on human action recognition benchmarks (UTKinect, Florence, HDM05), demonstrating its scalability and robustness in modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics across diverse domains."}

Using the publicly available IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset, we evaluate five representative architectures: ResNet-50, ResNet-101, DenseNet-161, EfficientNet-B0, and ViT-Base-Patch16-224, to explore model-dependent variations in Grad-CAM interpretability. We introduce a quantitative evaluation framework that combines localization accuracy, perturbation-based faithfulness, and explanation consistency to assess Grad-CAM reliability across architectures. Experimental findings reveal that while Grad-CAM effectively highlights salient tumor regions in most convolutional networks, its interpretive fidelity significantly degrades for Vision Transformer models due to non-local attention behavior. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons indicate substantial variability in saliency localization, implying that Grad-CAM explanations may not always correspond to the true diagnostic evidence used by the networks. This work exposes critical limitations of current saliency-based XAI approaches in medical imaging and emphasizes the need for model-aware interpretability methods that are both computationally sound and clinically meaningful. Our findings aim to inspire a more cautious and rigorous adoption of visual explanation tools in medical AI, urging the community to rethink what it truly means to \"trust\" a model's explanation."}

GerAV is built from Twitter and Reddit data, with the Reddit part further divided into in-domain and cross-domain message-based subsets, as well as a profile-based subset. This design enables controlled analysis of the effects of data source, topical domain, and text length.

We further observe a trade-off between specialization and generalization: models trained on specific data types perform best under matching conditions but generalize less well across data regimes, a limitation that can be mitigated by combining training sources. Overall, GerAV provides a challenging and versatile benchmark for advancing research on German and cross-domain AV."}

In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains."}

Two dominant paradigms have emerged: activation-aware methods such as AWQ prioritize channels with large activation magnitudes, while second-order methods such as GPTQ allocate quantization error according to input covariance structure. Despite strong empirical performance, these approaches remain conceptually fragmented, and it is unclear what underlying quantity they are approximating. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework for PTQ by formalizing activation sensitivity, defined as the expected impact of channel-wise perturbations on the loss. Using a first-order Taylor expansion, we show that sensitivity naturally arises as the squared norm of gradient-weighted activations, yielding a principled measure of channel importance that captures both activation magnitude and downstream error propagation. Within this framework, AWQ and GPTQ can be interpreted as complementary approximations that recover sensitivity under distinct simplifying assumptions. We analyze the design space of sensitivity metrics, connect gradient-based saliency, Fisher information, and Hessian-based criteria, and clarify their relationships to classical pruning methods such as Optimal Brain Damage and Optimal Brain Surgeon. Rather than proposing a new quantization algorithm, this work provides a conceptual foundation for understanding and comparing post-training quantization methods through the lens of sensitivity."}

We provide the first systematic test of whether SI can approximate True Ignorance (TI). Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality.

However, this paradigm encounters critical challenges when applied to vision-language models (VLM) (e.g., CLIP): constructing adversarially robust teacher for large-scale multi-modal models demands prohibitively high computational resources. We bridge this gap by revealing an interesting phenomenon: vanilla CLIP (without adversarial training) exhibits intrinsic defensive capabilities against adversarial examples generated by another CLIP with different architectures. We formally define this as proxy adversarial robustness, and naturally propose a Heterogeneous Proxy Transfer (HPT) framework that establishes cross-architectural robustness distillation channels between CLIP variants, effortlessly enabling the VLM robustness transfer from proxy to target models. Yet, such proxy transfer paradigm easily induces severe overfitting, leading to a sharp degradation in zero-shot natural generalization. To resolve that, we design Generalization-Pivot Decoupling (GPD) by leveraging the difference in learning rate scheduling. This decouples the proxy transfer process into a generalization-anchored warm-up that maintains generalization and a generalization-pulled HPT that promotes adversarial robustness, to achieve an equilibrium between natural generalization and adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on 15 zero-shot datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HPT-GPD method. The code is available at the website of github.com/fxw13/HPT-GPD."}

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \\emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \\textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \\textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems."}

Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

Despite advancements, SPFEM still struggles with accurate lip synchronization due to the complex interplay between facial expressions and mouth shapes. Capitalizing on the advanced capabilities of audio-driven talking head generation (AD-THG) models in synthesizing precise lip movements, our research introduces a novel integration of these models with SPFEM. We present a new framework, Talking Head Facial Expression Manipulation (THFEM), which utilizes AD-THG models to generate frames with accurately synchronized lip movements from audio inputs and SPFEM-altered images. However, increasing the number of frames generated by AD-THG models tends to compromise the realism and expression fidelity of the images. To counter this, we develop an adjacent frame learning strategy that finetunes AD-THG models to predict sequences of consecutive frames. This strategy enables the models to incorporate information from neighboring frames, significantly improving image quality during testing. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this framework effectively preserves mouth shapes during expression manipulations, highlighting the substantial benefits of integrating AD-THG with SPFEM."}

Additionally, we demonstrate that ND-MT exhibits significant potential in addressing the multi-modality issue that has long challenged MT research and provides higher-quality candidates than Deterministic MT (D-MT) under temperature constraints. However, ND-MT introduces new challenges in evaluating system performance. Specifically, the evaluation framework designed for D-MT fails to yield consistent evaluation results when applied to ND-MT. We further investigate this emerging challenge by evaluating five state-of-the-art ND-MT systems across three open datasets using both lexical-based and semantic-based metrics at varying sampling sizes. The results reveal a Buckets effect across these systems: the lowest-quality candidate generated by ND-MT consistently determines the overall system ranking across different sampling sizes for all reasonable metrics. Furthermore, we propose the ExpectoSample strategy to automatically assess the reliability of evaluation metrics for selecting robust ND-MT."}

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration.

Hybrid models that integrate full and linear attention layers promise a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but face two major challenges: training such hybrid models from scratch is computationally expensive, and manually designing the optimal placement of attention types is highly nontrivial. We address both issues by first transferring weights from the pretrained full-attention modules to its linear attention counterparts through blockwise local distillation, and second, introducing a greedy layer replacement strategy that iteratively substitutes full attention blocks with linear ones while monitoring validation performance on the target task. This yields a task-specific hybrid model in a single efficient pass, without costly re-training or neural architecture search, and can be applied to any pretrained full-attention backbone for diverse downstream tasks."}

In practice, deep networks are often overconfident: high-confidence predictions can still be wrong, while informative low-confidence samples near decision boundaries are discarded. This paper introduces a Confidence-Variance (CoVar) theory framework that provides a principled joint reliability criterion for pseudo-label selection. Starting from the entropy minimization principle, we derive a reliability measure that combines maximum confidence (MC) with residual-class variance (RCV), which characterizes how probability mass is distributed over non-maximum classes. The derivation shows that reliable pseudo-labels should have both high MC and low RCV, and that the influence of RCV increases as confidence grows, thereby correcting overconfident but unstable predictions. From this perspective, we cast pseudo-label selection as a spectral relaxation problem that maximizes separability in a confidence-variance feature space, and design a threshold-free selection mechanism to distinguish high- from low-reliability predictions. We integrate CoVar as a plug-in module into representative semi-supervised semantic segmentation and image classification methods. Across PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes, CIFAR-10, and Mini-ImageNet with varying label ratios and backbones, it consistently improves over strong baselines, indicating that combining confidence with residual-class variance provides a more reliable basis for pseudo-label selection than fixed confidence thresholds.

To demonstrate the strength of the framework, we first introduce a Human Chain-of-Thought (HCoT) annotation protocol to improve the diagnostic capability of existing judge benchmarks by separating evaluation into explicit dimensions: content (C), voice quality (VQ), and paralinguistics (P). Using this data, TRACE constructs a textual blueprint of inexpensive audio signals and prompts an LLM to render dimension-wise judgments, fusing them into an overall rating via a deterministic policy. TRACE achieves higher agreement with human raters than ALMs and transcript-only LLM judges while being significantly more cost-effective.

In this paper, we introduce MetamerGen, a tool for generating scenes that are aligned with latent human scene representations. MetamerGen is a latent diffusion model that combines peripherally obtained scene gist information with information obtained from scene-viewing fixations to generate image metamers for what humans understand after viewing a scene. Generating images from both high and low resolution (i.e. \"foveated\") inputs constitutes a novel image-to-image synthesis problem, which we tackle by introducing a dual-stream representation of the foveated scenes consisting of DINOv2 tokens that fuse detailed features from fixated areas with peripherally degraded features capturing scene context. To evaluate the perceptual alignment of MetamerGen generated images to latent human scene representations, we conducted a same-different behavioral experiment where participants were asked for a \"same\" or \"different\" response between the generated and the original image. With that, we identify scene generations that are indeed metamers for the latent scene representations formed by the viewers. MetamerGen is a powerful tool for understanding scene understanding. Our proof-of-concept analyses uncovered specific features at multiple levels of visual processing that contributed to human judgments. While it can generate metamers even conditioned on random fixations, we find that high-level semantic alignment most strongly predicts metamerism when the generated scenes are conditioned on viewers' own fixated regions."}

Then, by transforming faces from one pose to another, FPTN can further improve landmark heatmaps and faces hallucinated by DHLN for detecting more accurate landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore weakly-supervised FLD by integrating face hallucination and facial pose transfer tasks. Experimental results of both face hallucination and FLD demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques."}

Though analyzing and interpreting them contributes to significant values, e.g, disaster prediction and financial risk control, current workflows mainly rely on human data scientists, which requires significant labor costs and lacks automation. To tackle this, we introduce TimeART, a framework fusing the analytical capability of strong out-of-the-box tools and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which serves as a fully agentic data scientist for Time Series Question Answering (TSQA). To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning."}

However, it is critically challenged by the resource constraints of a single edge node. Distributed inference has emerged to aggregate and leverage computational resources across multiple devices. Yet, existing methods typically require strict synchronization, which is often infeasible due to the unreliable network conditions. In this paper, we propose HALO, a novel framework that can boost the distributed LLM inference in lossy edge network. The core idea is to enable a relaxed yet effective synchronization by strategically allocating less critical neuron groups to unstable devices, thus avoiding the excessive waiting time incurred by delayed packets. HALO introduces three key mechanisms: (1) a semantic-aware predictor to assess the significance of neuron groups prior to activation. (2) a parallel execution scheme of neuron group loading during the model inference. (3) a load-balancing scheduler that efficiently orchestrates multiple devices with heterogeneous resources. Experimental results from a Raspberry Pi cluster demonstrate that HALO achieves a 3.41x end-to-end speedup for LLaMA-series LLMs under unreliable network conditions. It maintains performance comparable to optimal conditions and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in various scenarios."}

However, they are still prone to generating irrelevant descriptions due to the lack of contextual information and the over-reliance on generated partial descriptions for predicting the remaining words. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Collaborative Transformer (DSCT) to address this issue by introducing the segmentation feature. The proposed DSCT consolidates and then fuses the region and segmentation features to guide the generation of caption sentences. It contains multiple Pattern-Specific Mutual Attention Encoders (PSMAEs) and Dynamic Nomination Decoders (DNDs). The PSMAE effectively highlights and consolidates the private information of two representations by querying each other. The DND dynamically searches for the most relevant learning blocks to the input textual representations and exploits the homogeneous features between the consolidated region and segmentation features to generate more accurate and descriptive caption sentences. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how to fuse different pattern-specific features in a dynamic way to bypass their semantic inconsistencies and spatial misalignment issues for image captioning. The experimental results from popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our DSCT outperforms the state-of-the-art image captioning models in the literature."}

In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-assisted approach for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability in Legal that is generalizable to other high-stakes domains. We model key legal concepts by following the \\textbf{IRAC} (Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion) framework, and construct a KG with 12K legal cases.

Our post-trained models obtained better average performance on 4/5 diverse legal benchmarks (14 tasks) than baselines.

However, traditional numerical solvers often fall short in meeting real-time performance requirements. To overcome this, we introduce a deep learning-based surrogate model that efficiently simulates transient brain deformation caused by continuous interactions between surgical instruments and the virtual brain geometry. Building on Universal Physics Transformers, our approach operates directly on large-scale mesh data and is trained on an extensive dataset generated from nonlinear finite element simulations, covering a broad spectrum of temporal instrument-tissue interaction scenarios. To reduce the accumulation of errors in autoregressive inference, we propose a stochastic teacher forcing strategy applied during model training. Specifically, training consists of short stochastic rollouts in which the proportion of ground truth inputs is gradually decreased in favor of model-generated predictions. Our results show that the proposed surrogate model achieves accurate and efficient predictions across a range of transient brain deformation scenarios, scaling to meshes with up to 150,000 nodes. The introduced stochastic teacher forcing technique substantially improves long-term rollout stability, reducing the maximum prediction error from 6.7 mm to 3.5 mm. We further integrate the trained surrogate model into an interactive neurosurgical simulation environment, achieving runtimes below 10 ms per simulation step on consumer-grade inference hardware. Our proposed deep learning framework enables rapid, smooth and accurate biomechanical simulations of dynamic brain tissue deformation, laying the foundation for realistic surgical training environments."}

This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \\textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models."}

Self-supervised speech representations (S3Rs) have driven many advances, but it remains unclear whether S3R-based turn-taking models rely on prosodic cues, lexical cues or both. We introduce a vocoder-based approach to control prosody and lexical cues in speech more cleanly than prior work. This allows us to probe the voice-activity projection model, an S3R-based turn-taking model. We find that prediction on prosody-matched, unintelligible noise is similar to accuracy on clean speech. This reveals both prosodic and lexical cues support turn-taking, but either can be used in isolation. Hence, future models may only require prosody, providing privacy and potential performance benefits. When either prosodic or lexical information is disrupted, the model exploits the other without further training, indicating they are encoded in S3Rs with limited interdependence. Results are consistent in CPC-based and wav2vec2.0 S3Rs. We discuss our findings and highlight a number of directions for future work. All code is available to support future research."}

We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets.

Most methods assume a fixed slot count K, and to better accommodate the dynamic nature of object cardinality, a few works have explored K-adaptive variants. However, existing K-adaptive methods still suffer from two limitations. First, they do not explicitly constrain slot-binding quality, so low-quality slots lead to ambiguous feature attribution. Second, adding a slot-count penalty to the reconstruction objective creates conflicting optimization goals between reducing the number of active slots and maintaining reconstruction fidelity. As a result, they still lag significantly behind strong K-fixed baselines. To address these challenges, we propose Quality-Guided K-Adaptive Slot Attention (QASA). First, we decouple slot selection from reconstruction, eliminating the mutual constraints between the two objectives. Then, we propose an unsupervised Slot-Quality metric to assess per-slot quality, providing a principled signal for fine-grained slot--object binding. Based on this metric, we design a Quality-Guided Slot Selection scheme that dynamically selects a subset of high-quality slots and feeds them into our newly designed gated decoder for reconstruction during training. At inference, token-wise competition on slot attention yields a K-adaptive outcome. Experiments show that QASA substantially outperforms existing K-adaptive methods on both real and synthetic datasets. Moreover, on real-world datasets QASA surpasses K-fixed methods."}

Specifically, we introduce a mamba-based generator with a residual dual-path strip scanning mechanism and a channel-reweighted spatial attention module. The former efficiently captures local texture features, while the latter models global dependencies. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in both quality and speed."}

We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%.

This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy.

Inspired by latent diffusion in other modalities, a natural idea is to compress graphs into a low-dimensional latent space and perform diffusion there. However, unlike images or text, graph generation requires nearly lossless reconstruction, as even a single error in decoding an adjacency matrix can render the entire sample invalid. This challenge has remained largely unaddressed. We propose LG-Flow, a latent graph diffusion framework that directly overcomes these obstacles. A permutation-equivariant autoencoder maps each node into a fixed-dimensional embedding from which the full adjacency is provably recoverable, enabling near-lossless reconstruction for both undirected graphs and DAGs. The dimensionality of this latent representation scales linearly with the number of nodes, eliminating the quadratic bottleneck and making it feasible to train larger and more expressive models. In this latent space, we train a Diffusion Transformer with flow matching, enabling efficient and expressive graph generation.

However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects. We significantly outperform the ego motion compensated CMT and UniBEV baselines, notably by $16.6$ % and $11.9$ % NDS on dynamic objects in the worst-case scenario of a $0.5 s$ time offset.

However, predicting ETA remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and complex nature of traffic flow. Traditional methods often combine real-time and historical traffic data in simplistic ways, or rely on complex rule-based computations. While recent deep learning models have shown potential, they often require high computational costs and do not effectively capture the spatio-temporal patterns crucial for ETA prediction.

To this end, we propose a multi-agent prompt optimization framework in which language-model agents jointly propose feature definitions, extract feature values, and evaluate feature quality using dataset-level performance and interpretability feedback.

CoT distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm to transfer reasoning prowess into compact Student Models (SLMs), but existing approaches often rely on a solitary teacher, capping the student's potential since individual LLMs often exhibit distinct capability biases and may suffer from catastrophic forgetting. While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect \"epiphany moments\" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer. Extensive experiments and latent space analysis demonstrate that COMPACT effectively integrates diverse reasoning capabilities without damaging the model's original knowledge structure, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting."}

We demonstrate that isotropic regularization mitigates label noise under both single-teacher and multiple i.i.d. teacher settings, whereas prior work accommodating multiple teachers either did not employ regularization or used memory-demanding methods. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal fixed regularization strength scales nearly linearly with the number of tasks $T$, specifically as $T/\\ln T$.

Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through experiments on linear regression and neural networks, illustrating how this scaling law affects generalization and offering a practical recipe for the design of continual learning systems."}

These heuristic perturbations frequently generate semantically invalid, out-of-distribution inputs that weaken the fidelity of local surrogate models. While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth. Empirical results demonstrate that LIME-LLM establishes a new benchmark for black-box NLP explainability, achieving significant improvements in local explanation fidelity compared to both traditional perturbation-based methods and recent generative alternatives."}

Existing approaches primarily rely on instance-level quality scores, or diversity metrics based on embedding clusters or semantic tags. However, constrained by the flatness of embedding spaces or the coarseness of tags, these approaches overlook fine-grained knowledge and its intrinsic hierarchical dependencies, consequently hindering precise data valuation and knowledge-aligned sampling. To address this challenge, we propose Tree-aware Aligned Global Sampling (TAGS), a unified framework that leverages a knowledge tree built from fine-grained tags, thereby enabling joint control of global quality, diversity, and target alignment. Using an LLM-based tagger, we extract atomic knowledge concepts, which are organized into a global tree through bottom-up hierarchical clustering. By grounding data instances onto this tree, a tree-aware metric then quantifies data quality and diversity, facilitating effective sampling. Our controllable sampling strategy maximizes tree-level information gain and enforces leaf-level alignment via KL-divergence for specific domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, it surpasses the full-dataset model by \\textbf{+5.84\\%} using only \\textbf{5\\%} of the data, while our aligned sampling strategy further boosts average performance by \\textbf{+4.24\\%}."}

In this work, we show that the activation pattern of a SOM - the squared distances to its prototypes - can be inverted to recover the exact input under mild geometric conditions. This follows from a classical fact in Euclidean distance geometry: a point in $D$ dimensions is uniquely determined by its distances to $D{+}1$ affinely independent references. We derive the corresponding linear system and characterize the conditions under which the inversion is well-posed. Building upon this mechanism, we introduce the Manifold-Aware Unified SOM Inversion and Control (MUSIC) update rule, which enables controlled, semantically meaningful trajectories in latent space. MUSIC modifies squared distances to selected prototypes while preserving others, resulting in a deterministic geometric flow aligned with the SOM's piecewise-linear structure. Tikhonov regularization stabilizes the update rule and ensures smooth motion on high-dimensional datasets. Unlike variational or probabilistic generative models, MUSIC does not rely on sampling, latent priors, or encoder-decoder architectures. If no perturbation is applied, inversion recovers the exact input; when a target cluster or prototype is specified, MUSIC produces coherent semantic variations while remaining on the data manifold. This leads to a new perspective on data augmentation and controllable latent exploration based solely on prototype geometry. We validate the approach using synthetic Gaussian mixtures, the MNIST and the Faces in the Wild dataset. Across all settings, MUSIC produces smooth, interpretable trajectories that reveal the underlying geometry of the learned manifold, illustrating the advantages of SOM-based inversion over unsupervised clustering."}

Using a substantial dataset of Reddit posts, we trained a logistic regression classifier on carefully curated subreddits for training, validation, and test splits. Comprehensive evaluation included feature ablation, keyword masking experiments, and varying-density difference analyses comparing anxious and control groups, along with external validation using clinically interviewed participants with diagnosed anxiety disorders. The model achieved strong performance while maintaining high accuracy even after sentiment removal or keyword masking. Early detection using minimal post history significantly outperformed random classification, and cross-domain analysis demonstrated strong consistency with clinical interview data.

Existing algorithmic fairness approaches typically seek to reduce such disparities by suppressing sensitive attributes. However, in medical settings these attributes often carry essential diagnostic information, and removing them can degrade accuracy and reliability, particularly in high-stakes applications. In contrast, clinical decision making explicitly incorporates patient context when interpreting diagnostic evidence, suggesting a different design direction for subgroup-aware models. In this paper, we introduce HyperAdapt, a patient-conditioned adaptation framework that improves subgroup reliability while maintaining a shared diagnostic model. Clinically relevant attributes such as age and sex are encoded into a compact embedding and used to condition a hypernetwork-style module, which generates small residual modulation parameters for selected layers of a shared backbone. This design preserves the general medical knowledge learned by the backbone while enabling targeted adjustments that reflect patient-specific variability. To ensure efficiency and robustness, adaptations are constrained through low-rank and bottlenecked parameterizations, limiting both model complexity and computational overhead. Experiments across multiple public medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves subgroup-level performance without sacrificing overall accuracy. On the PAD-UFES-20 dataset, our method outperforms the strongest competing baseline by 4.1% in recall and 4.4% in F1 score, with larger gains observed for underrepresented patient populations."}

In this paper, we close this gap by leveraging LLMs as surrogate models and candidate samplers inside a structured hierarchical search strategy. By adaptively partitioning the input space into disjoint hyperrectangular regions and ranking them with a composite score function, we restrict the generative process of the LLM to specific, high-potential sub-spaces, hence making the problem easier to solve as the LLM doesn't have to reason about the global structure of the problem, but only locally instead. We show that under standard regularity assumptions, our algorithm generates candidate solutions that converge to the true Pareto set in Hausdorff distance. Empirically, it consistently outperforms the global LLM-based multi-objective optimizer and is on par with standard evolutionary and Bayesian optimization algorithm on synthetic and real-world benchmarks."}

We introduce an abstraction-grounding framework that decomposes conceptual understanding into three capacities: interpretation of abstract concepts (Abstract-Abstract, A-A), grounding of abstractions in concrete events (Abstract-Concrete, A-C), and application of abstract principles to regulate concrete decisions (Concrete-Concrete, C-C). Using human values as a testbed - given their semantic richness and centrality to alignment - we employ probing (detecting value traces in internal activations) and steering (modifying representations to shift behavior). Across six open-source LLMs and ten value dimensions, probing shows that diagnostic probes trained solely on abstract value descriptions reliably detect the same values in concrete event narratives and decision reasoning, demonstrating cross-level transfer. Steering reveals an asymmetry: intervening on value representations causally shifts concrete judgments and decisions (A-C, C-C), yet leaves abstract interpretations unchanged (A-A), suggesting that encoded abstract values function as stable anchors rather than malleable activations.

In this paper, we introduce a fully self-reflective detoxification framework that harnesses the inherent capacities of LLMs to detect, correct toxic content, and refine LLMs without external modules and data annotation. Specifically, we propose a Toxic Signal Detector --an internal self-identification mechanism, coupled with a systematic intervention process to transform toxic text into its non-toxic counterpart.

Despite their success, AR models are inherently constrained by a causal bottleneck that limits global structural foresight and iterative refinement. Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a transformative alternative, conceptualizing text generation as a holistic, bidirectional denoising process akin to a sculptor refining a masterpiece. However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration."}

Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\\% and 8.80\\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \\& Resize with a 77\\% probability for seizure detection.

Traditional benchmark construction faces scaling challenges such as cost, scarcity of domain experts, and data contamination. We evaluate the validity of a simpler alternative: can translation quality alone indicate a model's broader multilingual capabilities? Through systematic evaluation of 14 models (1B-72B parameters) across 9 diverse benchmarks and 7 translation metrics, we find that translation performance is a good indicator of downstream task success (e.g., Phi-4, median Pearson r: MetricX = 0.89, xCOMET = 0.91, SSA-COMET = 0.87). These results suggest that the representational abilities supporting faithful translation overlap with those required for multilingual understanding. Translation quality, thus emerges as a strong, inexpensive first-pass proxy of multilingual performance, enabling a translation-first screening with targeted follow-up for specific tasks."}

With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis."}

We introduce Linearized Subspace Refinement (LSR), a general and architecture-agnostic framework that exploits the Jacobian-induced linear residual model at a fixed trained network state. By solving a reduced direct least-squares problem within this subspace, LSR computes a subspace-optimal solution of the linearized residual model, yielding a refined linear predictor with substantially improved accuracy over standard gradient-trained solutions, without modifying network architectures, loss formulations, or training procedures. Across supervised function approximation, data-driven operator learning, and physics-informed operator fine-tuning, we show that gradient-based training often fails to access this attainable accuracy, even when local linearization yields a convex problem. This observation indicates that loss-induced numerical ill-conditioning, rather than nonconvexity or model expressivity, can constitute a dominant practical bottleneck. In contrast, one-shot LSR systematically exposes accuracy levels not fully exploited by gradient-based training, frequently achieving order-of-magnitude error reductions. For operator-constrained problems with composite loss structures, we further introduce Iterative LSR, which alternates one-shot LSR with supervised nonlinear alignment, transforming ill-conditioned residual minimization into numerically benign fitting steps and yielding accelerated convergence and improved accuracy. By bridging nonlinear neural representations with reduced-order linear solvers at fixed linearization points, LSR provides a numerically grounded and broadly applicable refinement framework for supervised learning, operator learning, and scientific computing."}

Layerwise interventions further show that early and late MoE layers support language-specific processing, whereas middle layers serve as language-agnostic capacity hubs. Building on these insights, we propose a routing-guided steering method that adaptively guides routing behavior in middle layers toward shared experts associated with dominant languages at inference time, leading to consistent multilingual performance improvements, particularly for linguistically related language pairs.

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer.

This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.\n  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.\n  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP."}

We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation.

Using extensive datasets from Community Notes (CNs), EUvsDisinfo, and the Database of Known Fakes (DBKF), we quantify the prevalence and types of persuasion techniques across these fact-checking ecosystems. Contrary to prior hypothesis that community-produced debunks rely more heavily on subjective or persuasive wording, we find no evidence that CNs contain a higher average number of persuasion techniques than professional fact-checks. We additionally identify systematic rhetorical differences between CNs and professional debunking efforts, reflecting differences in institutional norms and topical coverage. Finally, we examine how the crowd evaluates persuasive language in CNs and show that, although notes with more persuasive elements receive slightly higher overall helpfulness ratings, crowd raters are effective at penalising the use of particular problematic rhetorical means"}

We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations."}

We propose the Additive U-Net, which replaces concatenative skips with gated additive connections. Each skip pathway is scaled by a learnable non-negative scalar, offering explicit and interpretable control over encoder contributions while avoiding channel inflation. Evaluations on the Kodak-17 denoising benchmark show that Additive U-Net achieves competitive PSNR/SSIM at noise levels σ = 15, 25, 50, with robustness across kernel schedules and depths. Notably, effective denoising is achieved even without explicit down/up-sampling or forced hierarchies, as the model naturally learns a progression from high-frequency to band-pass to low-frequency features. These results position additive skips as a lightweight and interpretable alternative to concatenation, enabling both efficient design and a clearer understanding of multi-scale information transfer in reconstruction networks."}

However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation.

The uniqueness of the presented dataset lies in the ethical and safety affiliated challenges that make collecting comparable data in real-world environments highly difficult. \\dataset~ not only features accurate gaze data and a complete state-space representation of objects in the virtual environment, but it also offers variable scenario complexities and rich annotations, including panoptic segmentation, depth information, and vehicle keypoints. We further propose object-based similarity (oSIM) as a novel metric to evaluate the performance of object-based visual attention models, a previously unexplored performance characteristic. Our evaluations show that explicitly optimising for object-based attention not only improves oSIM performance but also leads to an improved model performance on common metrics.

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM."}

However, their performance in synthesizing treasury futures data is still underexplored. This work emphasizes the characteristics of treasury futures data, including its low volume, market dependencies, and the grouped correlations among multivariables. To overcome these challenges, we propose TF-CoDiT, the first DiT framework for language-controlled treasury futures synthesis. To facilitate low-data learning, TF-CoDiT adapts the standard DiT by transforming multi-channel 1-D time series into Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) coefficient matrices. A U-shape VAE is proposed to encode cross-channel dependencies hierarchically into a latent variable and bridge the latent and DWT spaces through decoding, thereby enabling latent diffusion generation. To derive prompts that cover essential conditions, we introduce the Financial Market Attribute Protocol (FinMAP) - a multi-level description system that standardizes daily$/$periodical market dynamics by recognizing 17$/$23 economic indicators from 7/8 perspectives. In our experiments, we gather four types of treasury futures data covering the period from 2015 to 2025, and define data synthesis tasks with durations ranging from one week to four months. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TF-CoDiT can produce highly authentic data with errors at most 0.433 (MSE) and 0.453 (MAE) to the ground-truth. Further studies evidence the robustness of TF-CoDiT across contracts and temporal horizons."}

Despite the importance of such blended emotions, most video-based emotion recognition approaches are designed to recognize single emotions only. The few approaches that have attempted to recognize blended emotions typically cannot assess the relative salience of the emotions within a blend. This limitation largely stems from the lack of datasets containing a substantial number of blended emotion samples annotated with relative salience. To address this shortcoming, we introduce BLEMORE, a novel dataset for multimodal (video, audio) blended emotion recognition that includes information on the relative salience of each emotion within a blend. BLEMORE comprises over 3,000 clips from 58 actors, performing 6 basic emotions and 10 distinct blends, where each blend has 3 different salience configurations (50/50, 70/30, and 30/70). Using this dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art video classification approaches on two blended emotion prediction tasks: (1) predicting the presence of emotions in a given sample, and (2) predicting the relative salience of emotions in a blend. Our results show that unimodal classifiers achieve up to 29% presence accuracy and 13% salience accuracy on the validation set, while multimodal methods yield clear improvements, with ImageBind + WavLM reaching 35% presence accuracy and HiCMAE 18% salience accuracy. On the held-out test set, the best models achieve 33% presence accuracy (VideoMAEv2 + HuBERT) and 18% salience accuracy (HiCMAE). In sum, the BLEMORE dataset provides a valuable resource to advancing research on emotion recognition systems that account for the complexity and significance of blended emotion expressions."}

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis.

Comparative experiments with neural networks demonstrate that TPBS models outperform neural networks in the overfitting regime for most datasets, and maintain competitive performance otherwise.

In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions.

Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method. Compared with the previous best multi-agent approach, CoA, our model achieves improvements of 40.93%, 43.70%,121.57% and 33.12%, on NarrativeQA, Qasper, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, respectively."}

However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery."}

While LLMs are already achieving near-human accuracy on objective annotation tasks, their performance on subjective annotation tasks, such as those involving psychological constructs, is less consistent and more prone to errors. Standard evaluation practices typically collapse all annotation errors into a single alignment metric, but this simplified approach may obscure different kinds of errors that affect final analytical conclusions in different ways. Here, we propose a diagnostic evaluation paradigm that incorporates a human-in-the-loop step to separate task-inherent ambiguity from model-driven inaccuracies and assess annotation quality in terms of their potential downstream impacts. We refine this paradigm on ordinal annotation tasks, which are common in subjective annotation. The refined paradigm includes: (1) a diagnostic taxonomy that categorizes LLM annotation errors along two dimensions: source (model-specific vs. task-inherent) and type (boundary ambiguity vs. conceptual misidentification); (2) a lightweight human annotation test to estimate task-inherent ambiguity from LLM annotations; and (3) a computational method to decompose observed LLM annotation errors following our taxonomy. We validate this paradigm on four educational annotation tasks, demonstrating both its conceptual validity and practical utility. Theoretically, our work provides empirical evidence for why excessively high alignment is unrealistic in specific annotation tasks and why single alignment metrics inadequately reflect the quality of LLM annotations. In practice, our paradigm can be a low-cost diagnostic tool that assesses the suitability of a given task for LLM annotation and provides actionable insights for further technical optimization."}

The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task (\"does any value appear?\") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance."}

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

We introduce CausalSpatial, a diagnostic benchmark evaluating whether models can anticipate consequences of object motions across four tasks: Collision, Compatibility, Occlusion, and Trajectory. Results expose a severe gap: humans score 84% while GPT-5 achieves only 54%. Why do MLLMs fail? Our analysis uncovers a fundamental deficiency: models over-rely on textual chain-of-thought reasoning that drifts from visual evidence, producing fluent but spatially ungrounded hallucinations. To address this, we propose the Causal Object World model (COW), a framework that externalizes the simulation process by generating videos of hypothetical dynamics. With explicit visual cues of causality, COW enables models to ground their reasoning in physical reality rather than linguistic priors.

The probe is a small auxiliary network whose computation is orders of magnitude cheaper than token generation and can be evaluated fully in parallel with inference, enabling near-instantaneous hallucination risk estimation with effectively zero added latency in low-risk cases. We deploy the probe as an agentic critic for fast selective generation and routing, allowing LLMs to immediately answer confident queries while delegating uncertain ones to stronger verification pipelines. Across four QA benchmarks and multiple LLM families, the method achieves strong AUROC and AURAC, generalizes under dataset shift, and reveals interpretable structure in intermediate representations, positioning fast internal uncertainty readout as a principled foundation for reliable agentic AI."}

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

The core difficulty lies in the arbitrary and intricate distribution of vertices in 3D space, making it challenging for existing models to establish clean connectivity and resulting in suboptimal geometry. To address this, our core insight is to simplify the underlying geometric structure by constraining the distribution onto a simple and regular manifold, a topological sphere. Building on this, we first propose the Spherical Geometry Representation, a novel face representation that anchors geometric signals to uniform spherical coordinates. This guarantees a regular point distribution, from which the mesh connectivity can be robustly reconstructed. Critically, this canonical sphere can be seamlessly unwrapped into a 2D map, creating a perfect synergy with powerful 2D generative models. We then introduce Spherical Geometry Diffusion, a conditional diffusion framework built upon this 2D map. It enables diverse and controllable generation by jointly modeling geometry and texture, where the geometry explicitly conditions the texture synthesis process. Our method's effectiveness is demonstrated through its success in a wide range of tasks: text-to-3D generation, face reconstruction, and text-based 3D editing. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods in geometric quality, textual fidelity, and inference efficiency."}

Existing methods assess suitability primarily through student likelihood, favoring trajectories that closely align with the model's current behavior but overlooking more informative ones. Addressing this, we propose Rank-Surprisal Ratio (RSR), a simple metric that captures both alignment and informativeness to assess the suitability of a reasoning trajectory. RSR is motivated by the observation that effective trajectories typically combine low absolute probability with relatively high-ranked tokens under the student model, balancing learning signal strength and behavioral alignment. Concretely, RSR is defined as the ratio of a trajectory's average token-wise rank to its average negative log-likelihood, and is straightforward to compute and interpret. Across five student models and reasoning trajectories from 11 diverse teachers, RSR strongly correlates with post-training performance (average Spearman 0.86), outperforming existing metrics. We further demonstrate its practical utility in both trajectory selection and teacher selection."}

Traditional forecasting methods require significant expert knowledge and struggle to generalize across diverse deployment scenarios. Recent advancements in pre-trained time series models offer new opportunities, but their zero-shot performance on domain-specific tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, we propose a novel MoE Encoder module that augments pretrained forecasting models by injecting a sparse mixture-of-experts layer between tokenization and encoding. This design enables two key capabilities: (1) trans forming multivariate forecasting into an expert-guided univariate task, allowing the model to effectively capture inter-variable relations, and (2) supporting localized training and lightweight parameter sharing in federated settings where raw data cannot be exchanged. Extensive experiments on public multivariate datasets demonstrate that MoE-Encoder significantly improves forecasting accuracy compared to strong baselines. We further simulate federated environments and show that transferring only MoE-Encoder parameters allows efficient adaptation to new regions, with minimal performance degradation. Our findings suggest that MoE-Encoder provides a scalable and privacy-aware extension to foundation time series models."}

This paper presents a fully model-driven 4D radar perception framework designed for real-time execution on embedded edge hardware. The system uses radar as its sole perception modality and integrates domain aware multi threshold filtering, ego motion compensated temporal accumulation, KD tree Euclidean clustering with Doppler aware refinement, and a rule based 3D classifier. The framework is evaluated in a dust filled enclosed trailer and in real underground mining tunnels, and in the tested scenarios the radar based detector maintains stable pedestrian identification as camera and LiDAR modalities fail under severe visibility degradation. These results suggest that the proposed model-driven approach provides robust, interpretable, and computationally efficient perception for safety-critical applications in harsh industrial and subterranean environments."}

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

Instead of relying on rule-based interactions, agents can now interact in flexible ways akin to humans. However, this flexibility quickly becomes a problem in fields where errors can be disastrous, such as in a pharmacy context, but the opposite also holds true; a system that is too inflexible will also lead to errors, as it can become too rigid to handle situations that are not accounted for. Work using LLMs in a pharmacy context have adopted a wide scope, accounting for many different medications in brief interactions -- our strategy is the opposite: focus on a more narrow and long task. This not only enables a greater understanding of the task at hand, but also provides insight into what challenges are present in an interaction of longer nature. The main challenge, however, remains the same for a narrow and wide system: it needs to strike a balance between adherence to conversational requirements and flexibility. In an effort to strike such a balance, we present a prototype system meant to provide medication counseling while juggling these two extremes. We also cover our design in constructing such a system, with a focus on methods aiming to fulfill conversation requirements, reduce hallucinations and promote high-quality responses. The methods used have the potential to increase the determinism of the system, while simultaneously not removing the dynamic conversational abilities granted by the usage of LLMs. However, a great deal of work remains ahead, and the development of this kind of system needs to involve continuous testing and a human-in-the-loop. It should also be evaluated outside of commonly used benchmarks for LLMs, as these do not adequately capture the complexities of this kind of conversational system."}

Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups. Our findings demonstrate that uniqueness ratio offers an explainable and practical signal for assessing join induced privacy risk, providing a foundation for developing more comprehensive pre-join risk estimation models."}

In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85.

Existing approaches to evaluating LLM-based rare disease diagnosis suffer from two critical limitations: they rely on idealized clinical case studies that fail to capture real-world clinical complexity, or they use ICD codes as disease labels, which significantly undercounts rare diseases since many lack direct mappings to comprehensive rare disease databases like Orphanet. To address these limitations, we explore MIMIC-RD, a rare disease differential diagnosis benchmark constructed by directly mapping clinical text entities to Orphanet. Our methodology involved an initial LLM-based mining process followed by validation from four medical annotators to confirm identified entities were genuine rare diseases. We evaluated various models on our dataset of 145 patients and found that current state-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly on rare disease differential diagnosis, highlighting the substantial gap between existing capabilities and clinical needs. From our findings, we outline several future steps towards improving differential diagnosis of rare diseases."}

Their structural differences, continual evolution, and limited cross-resource alignment require substantial manual integration, limiting the depth and scale of knowledge exploration. We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis. These results highlight the potential of knowledge-graph-driven Deep Research to accelerate biomedical discovery."}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for addressing this issue, their effectiveness is often hindered by Sycophancy, a tendency to produce reasoning that matches users' beliefs over truthful ones, which deviates from instruction-following principles. Rather than treating sycophancy as a flaw to be eliminated, this work proposes a novel approach that initially harnesses this behavior to generate contrastive reasoning from opposing perspectives. Specifically, we design a Self-renewal Opposing-stance Reasoning Generation (SORG) framework that prompts LLMs to produce high-quality agree and disagree reasoning pairs for a given news title without requiring ground-truth labels. To utilize the generated reasoning, we develop a local Opposing Reasoning-based Clickbait Detection (ORCD) model that integrates three BERT encoders to represent the title and its associated reasoning. The model leverages contrastive learning, guided by soft labels derived from LLM-generated credibility scores, to enhance detection robustness. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms LLM prompting, fine-tuned smaller language models, and state-of-the-art clickbait detection baselines."}

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage deep learning, but they require a carefully curated training dataset. Because constructing a proper training dataset for image smoothing is challenging, we propose DIP-$\\ell_0$, a deep image prior framework that incorporates the $\\ell_0$ gradient regularizer. This framework can perform high-quality image smoothing without any training data. To properly minimize the associated loss function that has the nonconvex, nonsmooth $\\ell_0$ ``norm\", we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm that utilizes an off-the-shelf $\\ell_0$ gradient minimization solver.

Experiments across large-scale pre-training (English C4, Vietnamese VietVault) and fine-tuning (GLUE) demonstrate that AdaFRUGAL achieves a compelling trade-off.

Replay behaviors, in particular, may indicate productive struggle or broader exploration, which in turn foster deeper learning. However, little is known about how these pathways unfold sequentially across problems or how the timing of replays and other problem-solving strategies relates to proximal and distal learning outcomes. This study addresses these gaps using Markov Chains and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) on log data from 777 seventh graders playing the game-based learning platform of From Here to There!. Results show that within problem sequences, students often persisted in states or engaged in immediate replay after successful completions, while across problems, strong self-transitions indicated stable strategic pathways. Four latent states emerged from HMMs: Incomplete-dominant, Optimal-ending, Replay, and Mixed. Regression analyses revealed that engagement in replay-dominant and optimal-ending states predicted higher conceptual knowledge, flexibility, and performance compared with the Incomplete-dominant state. Immediate replay consistently supported learning outcomes, whereas delayed replay was weakly or negatively associated in relation to Non-Replay. These findings suggest that replay in digital learning is not uniformly beneficial but depends on timing, with immediate replay supporting flexibility and more productive exploration."}

However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off."}

Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks."}

Highlights help readers grasp essential ideas quickly and are often easier to read and understand than longer paragraphs, especially on mobile devices. The track uses the MixSub dataset \\cite{10172215}, which provides pairs of abstracts and corresponding author-written highlights.\n  In this inaugural edition of the track, 12 teams participated, exploring various approaches, including pre-trained language models, to generate highlights from this scientific dataset. All submissions were evaluated using established metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore to measure both alignment with author-written highlights and overall informativeness. Teams were ranked based on ROUGE-L scores. The findings suggest that automatically generated highlights can reduce reading effort, accelerate literature reviews, and enhance metadata for digital libraries and academic search platforms.

Foundation and mathematical proofs can be found in the companion paper arXiv:2601.00638", "summary": "Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional \"Zero-Mode Attractor\" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($σ^2 \\equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence."}

FocaLogic identifies minimal interpretable subsets of visual regions-termed visual focuses-that decisively influence model predictions. It translates these visual focuses into precise and compact logical expressions, enabling transparent and structured interpretations. Additionally, we propose a suite of quantitative metrics, including focus precision, recall, and divergence, to objectively evaluate model behavior across diverse scenarios. Empirical analyses demonstrate FocaLogic's capability to uncover critical insights such as training-induced concentration, increasing focus accuracy through generalization, and anomalous focuses under biases and adversarial attacks. Overall, FocaLogic provides a systematic, scalable, and quantitative solution for interpreting visual models."}

In this work, we study MoEs through a geometric lens, interpreting routing as a form of soft partitioning of the representation space into overlapping local charts. We introduce a Dual Jacobian-PCA Spectral Geometry probe. It analyzes local function geometry via Jacobian singular-value spectra and representation geometry via weighted PCA of routed hidden states. Using a controlled MLP-MoE setting that permits exact Jacobian computation, we compare dense, Top-k, and fully-soft routing architectures under matched capacity. Across random seeds, we observe that MoE routing consistently reduces local sensitivity, with expert-local Jacobians exhibiting smaller leading singular values and faster spectral decay than dense baselines. At the same time, weighted PCA reveals that expert-local representations distribute variance across a larger number of principal directions, indicating higher effective rank under identical input distributions. We further find that average expert Jacobians are nearly orthogonal, suggesting a decomposition of the transformation into low-overlap expert-specific subspaces rather than scaled variants of a shared map. We analyze how routing sharpness modulates these effects, showing that Top-k routing produces lower-rank, more concentrated expert-local structure, while fully-soft routing yields broader, higher-rank representations. Together, these results support a geometric interpretation of MoEs as soft partitionings of function space that flatten local curvature while redistributing representation variance."}

The most common implementation of MCP, proposed by Anthropic, heavily relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose tasks and issue instructions to servers, which act as stateless executors. In particular, the agents, models, and servers are stateless and do not have access to a global context. However, in tasks involving LLM-driven coordination, it is natural that a Shared Context Store (SCS) could improve the efficiency and coherence of multi-agent workflows by reducing redundancy and enabling knowledge transfer between servers. Thus, in this work, we design and assess the performance of a Context-Aware MCP (CA-MCP) that offloads execution logic to specialized MCP servers that read from and write to a shared context memory, allowing them to coordinate more autonomously in real time. In this design, context management serves as the central mechanism that maintains continuity across task executions by tracking intermediate states and shared variables, thereby enabling persistent collaboration among agents without repeated prompting. We present experiments showing that the CA-MCP can outperform the traditional MCP by reducing the number of LLM calls required for complex tasks and decreasing the frequency of response failures when task conditions are not satisfied, thereby improving overall efficiency and responsiveness. In particular, we conducted experiments on the TravelPlanner and REALM-Bench benchmark datasets and observed statistically significant results indicating the potential advantages of incorporating a shared context store via CA-MCP in LLM-driven multi-agent systems."}

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions."}

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

We show that a frozen diffusion backbone enables strong fine-grained recognition by probing intermediate denoising features across layers and timesteps and training a linear classifier for each pair. We evaluate this in a real-world plankton-monitoring setting with practical impact, using controlled and comparable training setups against established supervised and self-supervised baselines. Frozen diffusion features are competitive with supervised baselines and outperform other self-supervised methods in both balanced and naturally long-tailed settings. Out-of-distribution evaluations on temporally and geographically shifted plankton datasets further show that frozen diffusion features maintain strong accuracy and Macro F1 under substantial distribution shift."}

While Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-Judge approaches offer scalability, their reliability in evaluating adherence of different types of system instructions remains unverified. This study asks: To what extent does the instruction type of an Application Under Test (AUT) influence the stability of judge evaluations? To address this, we introduce the Scoped Instruction Decomposition Framework to classify AUT instructions into Objective and Subjective types, isolating the factors that drive judge instability. We applied this framework to two representative HR GenAI applications, evaluating the stability of four judge architectures over variable runs. Our results reveal a ``Stability Trap'' characterized by a divergence between Verdict Stability and Reasoning Stability. While judges achieved near-perfect verdict agreement ($>99\\%$) for both objective and subjective evaluations, their accompanying justification traces diverged significantly. Objective instructions requiring quantitative analysis, such as word counting, exhibited reasoning stability as low as $\\approx19\\%$, driven by variances in numeric justifications. Similarly, reasoning stability for subjective instructions varied widely ($35\\%$--$83\\%$) based on evidence granularity, with feature-specific checks failing to reproduce consistent rationale. Conversely, objective instructions focusing on discrete entity extraction achieved high reasoning stability ($>90\\%$). These findings demonstrate that high verdict stability can mask fragile reasoning. Thus, we suggest that auditors scope automated evaluation protocols strictly: delegate all deterministically verifiable logic to code, while reserving LLM judges for complex semantic evaluation."}

T1-weighted (T1w) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to identify macroscopic brain alterations, but these changes typically emerge relatively late in the disease course. Diffusion MRI (dMRI), in contrast, is sensitive to earlier microstructural abnormalities by probing water diffusion in brain tissue. dMRI metrics, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), provide complementary information about white matter integrity and neurodegeneration. However, dMRI acquisitions are time-consuming and susceptible to motion artifacts, limiting their routine use in clinical populations. To bridge this gap, I propose a 3D TransUNet image synthesis framework that predicts FA and MD maps directly from T1w MRI. My model generates high-fidelity maps, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) exceeding 0.93 and a strong Pearson correlation (>0.94) with ground-truth dMRI. When integrated into a multi-modal diagnostic model, these synthetic features boost AD classification accuracy by 5% (78.75%->83.75%) and, most importantly, improve mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection by 12.5%. This study demonstrates that high-quality diffusion microstructural information can be inferred from routinely acquired T1w MRI, effectively transferring the benefits of multi-modality imaging to settings where diffusion data are unavailable. By reducing scan time while preserving complementary structural and microstructural information, the proposed approach has the potential to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of AD diagnosis in clinical practice."}

To assess these without gold labels, we introduce evaluation metrics for span consistency, distinctiveness, and human-AI distributional agreement. We found DA-awareness produces segments that are internally more consistent than text-only baselines. While LLMs excel at creating construct-consistent spans, coherence-based baselines remain superior at detecting global shifts in dialogue flow. Across two datasets, no single segmenter dominates.

Recent GAN- and diffusion-based enhancement methods improve perceptual quality by aligning degraded images with high-quality distributions, but our analysis shows that this focus can distort intra-class geometry: clinically related samples become dispersed, disease-class boundaries blur, and downstream tasks such as grading or lesion detection are harmed. The Gromov Wasserstein (GW) discrepancy offers a principled solution by aligning distributions through internal pairwise distances, naturally preserving intra-class structure, but its high computational cost restricts practical use. To overcome this, we propose SGW-GAN, the first framework to incorporate Sliced GW (SGW) into retinal image enhancement. SGW approximates GW via random projections, retaining relational fidelity while greatly reducing cost. Experiments on public datasets show that SGW-GAN produces visually compelling enhancements, achieves superior diabetic retinopathy grading, and reports the lowest GW discrepancy across disease labels, demonstrating both efficiency and clinical fidelity for unpaired medical image enhancement."}

In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled new technological approaches to problem-generation tasks. Although existing LLMs can achieve high correctness rates, they generally lack innovation and exhibit poor discrimination. In this paper, we propose the task of innovative math problem generation (IMPG). To solve the IMPG task, this paper proposes a self-evolving, multi-role collaborative framework with fine-grained difficulty guidance. First, a multi-role collaborative mechanism comprising a sampler, generator, evaluator, state machine, and memory is constructed, ensuring the correctness of generated problems through iterative optimization informed by self-assessment and external feedback. Second, we introduce an improved difficulty model to quantify difficulty and provide fine-grained guidance. We adopt the data-driven association-guided path sampling (DAPS) algorithm to enhance the semantic rationality of sampled encodings. Third, we construct the HSM3K-CN dataset, which comprises high-quality high school math problems. A multi-stage training pipeline is adopted, incorporating continual pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and group relative policy optimization (GRPO), to enhance the generation and evaluation capabilities of the base model. Finally, system self-evolution is achieved by transferring evaluation capabilities from the expert model to the apprentice model via distillation. Experiments show that, compared to baseline models, our proposed method significantly improves the innovation of the generated problems while maintaining a high correctness rate."}

Most interpretability approaches emphasise static representations or causal interventions, leaving temporal structure largely unexplored. Drawing on neuroscience, where temporal integration and metastability are core markers of neural organisation, we adapt these concepts to transformer models and discuss a composite dynamical metric, computed from activation time-series during autoregressive generation. We evaluate this metric in GPT-2-medium across five conditions: structured reasoning, forced repetition, high-temperature noisy sampling, attention-head pruning, and weight-noise injection. Structured reasoning consistently exhibits elevated metric relative to repetitive, noisy, and perturbed regimes, with statistically significant differences confirmed by one-way ANOVA and large effect sizes in key comparisons. These results are robust to layer selection, channel subsampling, and random seeds. Our findings demonstrate that neuroscience-inspired dynamical metrics can reliably characterise differences in computational organisation across functional regimes in large language models. We stress that the proposed metric captures formal dynamical properties and does not imply subjective experience."}

Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks.

RSP is computed from within-run drift dynamics and requires no tuning on out-of-distribution data. Across multiple lightweight transformer classifiers and benchmark classification tasks, drift typically collapses into a low, stable regime early in training, while validation accuracy continues to change only marginally. In a controlled shortcut setting with label-correlated trigger tokens, attribution dynamics expose increasing reliance on the shortcut even when validation accuracy remains competitive. Overall, explanation drift provides a simple, low-cost diagnostic for monitoring how decision evidence evolves during fine-tuning and for selecting checkpoints in a stable-evidence regime."}

However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse \"spill-over\" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead."}

This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online."}

The challenge is exacerbated by the RS highly heterogeneous data and huge scale variation. Consequently, paradigms proven effective in other domains often fail when confronted with these unique data characteristics. Conventional disentanglement learning, which relies on significant feature overlap between modalities (modality-invariant), is insufficient for this heterogeneity. Similarly, knowledge distillation becomes an ill-posed mimicry task where a student fails to focus on the necessary compensatory knowledge, leaving the semantic gap unaddressed. Our work is therefore built upon three pillars uniquely designed for RS: (1) principled missing information compensation, (2) class-specific modality contribution, and (3) multi-resolution feature importance. We propose a novel method DIS2, a new paradigm shifting from modality-shared feature dependence and untargeted imitation to active, guided missing features compensation. Its core novelty lies in a reformulated synergy between disentanglement learning and knowledge distillation, termed DLKD. Compensatory features are explicitly captured which, when fused with the features of the available modality, approximate the ideal fused representation of the full-modality case. To address the class-specific challenge, our Classwise Feature Learning Module (CFLM) adaptively learn discriminative evidence for each target depending on signal availability. Both DLKD and CFLM are supported by a hierarchical hybrid fusion (HF) structure using features across resolutions to strengthen prediction.

To solve this problem, we introduce TAAR (Trap-Aware Adaptive Restart), a test-time control framework that trains a diagnostic policy to predict two signals from partial trajectories: a trap index for where to truncate and an escape probability for whether and how strongly to intervene. At inference time, TAAR truncates the trajectory before the predicted trap segment and adaptively restarts decoding; for severely trapped cases, it applies stronger perturbations, including higher-temperature resampling and an optional structured reboot suffix.

Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality."}

To address this, we propose GO-MLVTON, the first multi-layer VTON method, introducing the Garment Occlusion Learning module to learn occlusion relationships and the StableDiffusion-based Garment Morphing & Fitting module to deform and fit garments onto the human body, producing high-quality multi-layer try-on results.

We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR).

In this research, we introduce a physics-based synthetic simulation framework (PSSF) to fully generate controllable X-ray scans without patients' involvement and violating their privacy and institutional constraints. This PSSF is a 2D X-ray projection simulator of anteroposterior knee radiographs from a parametric anatomical model of the distal femur and proximal tibia.

Practically, three machine learning (ML) models are utilized, logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to train binary (KL-like \"0\" vs. \"2\") and three-class (0-2) prediction radiographic images.

We also highlight the need for privacy metrics that fairly account for the probabilistic nature of machine learning models. As a demonstration, we use SynQP to benchmark CTGAN and propose a new identity disclosure risk metric that offers a more accurate estimation of privacy risks compared to existing approaches.

However, a critical limitation of existing approaches is their reliance on unconstrained global matching strategies. In open-world scenarios, trying to match anchor features against the entire query image space introduces excessive ambiguity, as target features are easily confused with background distractors. To resolve this, we propose Fine-grained Correspondence Pose Estimation (FiCoP), a framework that transitions from noise-prone global matching to spatially-constrained patch-level correspondence. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a patch-to-patch correlation matrix as a structural prior to narrowing the matching scope, effectively filtering out irrelevant clutter to prevent it from degrading pose estimation. Firstly, we introduce an object-centric disentanglement preprocessing to isolate the semantic target from environmental noise. Secondly, a Cross-Perspective Global Perception (CPGP) module is proposed to fuse dual-view features, establishing structural consensus through explicit context reasoning. Finally, we design a Patch Correlation Predictor (PCP) that generates a precise block-wise association map, acting as a spatial filter to enforce fine-grained, noise-resilient matching. Experiments on the REAL275 and Toyota-Light datasets demonstrate that FiCoP improves Average Recall by 8.0% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art method, highlighting its capability to deliver robust and generalized perception for robotic agents operating in complex, unconstrained open-world environments.

Moreover, progress in this field is hindered by the absence of large-scale dedicated benchmarks, while existing models are often affected by biased initial memory construction that impairs accurate instance localization in complex scenarios, as well as indiscriminate memory accumulation that encodes noise from occlusions or misclassifications, leading to persistent error propagation. This paper advances RS-RVOS research through dual contributions in data and methodology. First, we construct RS-RVOS Bench, the first large-scale benchmark comprising 111 video sequences, about 25,000 frames, and 213,000 temporal referring annotations. Unlike common RVOS benchmarks where many expressions are written with access to the full video context, our dataset adopts a strict causality-aware annotation strategy in which linguistic references are generated solely from the target state in the initial frame. Second, we propose a memory-quality-aware online referring segmentation framework, termed Memory Quality Control with Segment Anything Model (MQC-SAM). MQC-SAM introduces a temporal motion consistency module for initial memory calibration, leveraging short-term motion trajectory priors to correct structural deviations and establish accurate memory anchoring. Furthermore, it incorporates a decoupled attention-based memory integration mechanism with dynamic quality assessment, selectively updating high-confidence semantic features while filtering unreliable information, thereby effectively preventing error accumulation and propagation.

To bridge this gap, we propose ChartVerse, a scalable framework designed to synthesize complex charts and reliable reasoning data from scratch. (1) To address the bottleneck of simple patterns, we first introduce Rollout Posterior Entropy (RPE), a novel metric that quantifies chart complexity. Guided by RPE, we develop complexity-aware chart coder to autonomously synthesize diverse, high-complexity charts via executable programs.

Diverging from standard generation, we adopt an answer-first paradigm: we extract deterministic answers directly from the source code, generate questions conditional on these anchors, and enforce strict consistency verification. To further elevate difficulty and reasoning depth, we filter samples based on model fail-rate and distill high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We curate ChartVerse-SFT-600K and ChartVerse-RL-40K using Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking as the teacher.

In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, a fixed-length number embedding vector that preserves algebraic operations, including addition, multiplication, and comparison, within the field of rational numbers. We propose a novel Neural Isomorphic Field, a neural abstraction of algebraic structures such as groups and fields.

As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents."}

However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on."}

Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks."}

Previous state-of-the-art grounding visual language models usually have large model sizes, making them heavy for deployment and slow for inference. However, we notice that the sizes of visual encoders are nearly the same for small and large VLMs and the major difference is the sizes of the language models. Small VLMs fall behind larger VLMs in grounding because of the difference in language understanding capability rather than visual information handling. To mitigate the gap, we introduce 'Efficient visual Grounding language Models' (EGM): a method to scale the test-time computation (#generated tokens). Scaling the test-time computation of a small model is deployment-friendly, and yields better end-to-end latency as the cost of each token is much cheaper compared to directly running a large model. On the RefCOCO benchmark, our EGM-Qwen3-VL-8B demonstrates 91.4 IoU with an average of 737ms (5.9x faster) latency while Qwen3-VL-235B demands 4,320ms to achieve 90.5 IoU. To validate our approach's generality, we further set up a new amodal grounding setting that requires the model to predict both the visible and occluded parts of the objects. Experiments show our method can consistently and significantly improve the vanilla grounding and amodal grounding capabilities of small models to be on par with or outperform the larger models, thereby improving the efficiency for visual grounding."}

However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs.\n  We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency.\n  To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net."}

A naive strategy is to either enlarge inputs or downsample the WSIs. However, enlarging inputs results in prohibitive GPU memory consumption, while downsampling alters the microns-per-pixel resolution and obscures critical morphological details. To overcome these limitations, we propose an space- and time- efficient inference strategy that sparsifies attention using spatially aware neighboring blocks and filters out non-informative tokens through global attention scores. This design substantially reduces GPU memory and runtime during high-resolution WSI inference while preserving and even improving the downstream performance, enabling inference at higher resolutions under the same GPU budget. The experimental results show that our method can achieves up to an 7.67% improvement in the ROI classification and compatible results in segmentation."}

Previous work achieved this with loss functions. Recent advancements in classification have shown that the discriminative ability of embeddings can be strengthened by imposing maximum class separation as inductive bias. This technique has never been used in the domain of face-voice association, and this work aims at filling this gap. More specifically, we develop a method for face-voice association that imposes maximum class separation among multimodal representations of different speakers as an inductive bias. Through quantitative experiments we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it achieves SOTA performance on two task formulation of face-voice association. Furthermore, we carry out an ablation study to show that imposing inductive bias is most effective when combined with losses for inter-class orthogonality. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first that applies and demonstrates the effectiveness of maximum class separation as an inductive bias in multimodal learning; it hence paves the way to establish a new paradigm."}

As a result, it is unclear whether LLMs can reliably generate executable code tailored to a user's specific environment. We present the first systematic study of Environment-Aware Code Generation (EACG), where generated code must be functionally correct and directly executable under arbitrary software configurations. To enable realistic evaluation, we introduce VersiBCB, a benchmark that is multi-package, execution-verified, and deprecation-aware, capturing complex and evolving environments that prior datasets often overlook. Using VersiBCB, we investigate three complementary adaptation axes: data, parameters, and cache, and develop representative strategies for each. Our results show that current LLMs struggle with environment-specific code generation, while our adaptations improve environment compatibility and executability. These findings highlight key challenges and opportunities for deploying LLMs in practical software engineering workflows."}

Histomorphology is a crucial component of the integrated diagnosis of GBM-IDHwt. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have shown promise to extract additional prognostic information from histological whole-slide images (WSI) of hematoxylin and eosin-stained glioblastoma tissue. Here, we present an explainable AI-based method to support systematic interpretation of histomorphological features associated with survival. It combines an explainable multiple instance learning (MIL) architecture with a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to relate human-interpretable visual patterns of tissue to survival. The MIL architecture directly identifies prognosis-relevant image tiles and the SAE maps these tiles post-hoc to visual patterns. The MIL method was trained and evaluated using a new real-world dataset that comprised 720 GBM-IDHwt cases from three hospitals and four cancer registries in Germany. The SAE was trained using 1878 WSIs of glioblastoma from five independent public data collections. Despite the many factors influencing survival time, our method showed some ability to discriminate between patients living less than 180 days or more than 360 days solely based on histomorphology (AUC: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.63-0.72). Cox proportional hazards regression confirmed a significant difference in survival time between the predicted groups after adjustment for established prognostic factors (hazard ratio: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.26-1.72). Our method identified multiple interpretable visual patterns associated with survival. Three neuropathologists separately found that 21 of the 24 most strongly associated patterns could be clearly attributed to seven histomorphological categories. Necrosis and hemorrhage appeared to be associated with shorter survival while highly cellular tumor areas were associated with longer survival."}

However, the adoption of such verifiers towards code generation has been comparatively sparse, with execution feedback constituting the dominant signal. Nonetheless, code verifiers remain valuable toward judging model outputs in scenarios where execution feedback is hard to obtain and are a potentially powerful addition to the code generation post-training toolbox. To this end, we create and open-source Aletheia, a controlled testbed that enables execution-grounded evaluation of code verifiers' robustness across disparate policy models and covariate shifts. We examine components of the RLVR-based verifier training recipe widely credited for its success: (1) intermediate thinking traces, (2) learning from negative samples, and (3) on-policy training. While experiments show the optimality of RLVR, we uncover important opportunities to simplify the recipe. Particularly, despite code verification exhibiting positive training- and inference-time scaling, on-policy learning stands out as the key component at small verifier sizes, and thinking-based training emerges as the most important component at larger scales."}

However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \\textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \\textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems."}

Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of <3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats."}

We train a shallow recurrent neural network that achieves excellent performance (98.3 percent Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score and 1.4 percent equal error rate on average across all synthesizers and datasets) using nonfeaturized trajectory data as input. In few-shot settings, we show that our classifier achieves such an excellent performance when trained on just 10 percent of the data, as evaluated on the remaining 90% of the data as a test set.

We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario.

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms.

By exploiting the orthogonality and self-inverse properties of Walsh functions, the system distributes and learns to encode bit-words across parallel Walsh branches. Through analytical modeling and simulation, we characterize how 5G CPOFDM interference maps into the Walsh domain and identify optimal ratios of transmission frequencies and sampling rate where the end-to-end autoencoder achieves the highest rejection.

While recent progress has been made in large-scale pretraining, most approaches overlook the spectral structure of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, wherein physiological rhythms unfold across multiple frequency bands. Motivated by the insight that many downstream health-related tasks depend on multi-resolution features spanning fine-grained waveform morphology to global rhythmic dynamics, we introduce Masked Multiscale Reconstruction (MMR) for PPG representation learning - a self-supervised pretraining framework that explicitly learns from hierarchical time-frequency scales of PPG data. The pretraining task is designed to reconstruct randomly masked out coefficients obtained from a wavelet-based multiresolution decomposition of PPG signals, forcing the transformer encoder to integrate information across temporal and spectral scales. We pretrain our model with MMR using ~17 million unlabeled 10-second PPG segments from ~32,000 smartwatch users. On 17 of 19 diverse health-related tasks, MMR trained on large-scale wearable PPG data improves over or matches state-of-the-art open-source PPG foundation models, time-series foundation models, and other self-supervised baselines.

To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential."}

This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations.

Traditional surrogate models for calorimeter shower modeling train separate networks for each particle species, limiting scalability and reuse. We introduce AllShowers, a unified generative model that simulates calorimeter showers across multiple particle types using a single generative model. AllShowers is a continuous normalizing flow model with a Transformer architecture, enabling it to generate complex spatial and energy correlations in variable-length point cloud representations of showers. Trained on a diverse dataset of simulated showers in the highly granular ILD detector, the model demonstrates the ability to generate realistic showers for electrons, photons, and charged and neutral hadrons across a wide range of incident energies and angles without retraining. In addition to unifying shower generation for multiple particle types, AllShowers surpasses the fidelity of previous single-particle-type models for hadronic showers. Key innovations include the use of a layer embedding, allowing the model to learn all relevant calorimeter layer properties; a custom attention masking scheme to reduce computational demands and introduce a helpful inductive bias; and a shower- and layer-wise optimal transport mapping to improve training convergence and sample quality.

This survey provides a unified perspective of visual puzzle reasoning in LVLMs. We frame visual puzzles through a common abstraction and organize existing benchmarks by the reasoning mechanisms they target (inductive, analogical, algorithmic, deductive, and geometric/spatial), thereby linking puzzle design to the cognitive operations required for solving. Synthesizing empirical evidence across these categories, we identify consistent limitations in current models, including brittle generalization, tight entanglement between perception and reasoning, and a persistent gap between fluent explanations and faithful execution.

To support this study, we introduce AraMega-SSum, a novel dataset for Arabic speech summarization.

Our results reveal a critical efficiency, robustness trade-off: while ADS accelerates initial convergence and boosts paralinguistic F1-scores, its inherent gradient volatility can destabilize generative decoding under prolonged training. Furthermore, while the TPC stabilizes core acoustic mapping, it often induces negative transfer in downstream tasks. We demonstrate that a Hybrid TPC+ADS Strategy provides an optimal training ``recipe'', first establishing a robust representative foundation before employing diversity-aware refinement to capture fine-grained nuances. These findings offer practical guidance for the efficient adaptation of Omni-models in complex, low-resource multimodal environments."}

Experimental results show that Proc3D outperforms existing methods in editing efficiency, achieving more than 400x speedup over conventional approaches that require full regeneration for each modification. Additionally, Proc3D improves ULIP scores by 28%, a metric that evaluates the alignment between generated 3D models and text prompts.

Yet robot-oriented reconstruction faces a trilemma: sparse forward-facing views cause weak parallax and ill-posed geometry; dynamic occlusions and extreme lighting hinder stable texture fusion; and neural rendering typically needs expensive offline optimization, violating edge-side streaming constraints. We propose ParkingTwin, a training-free, lightweight system for online streaming 3D reconstruction. First, OSM-prior-driven geometric construction uses OpenStreetMap semantic topology to directly generate a metric-consistent TSDF, replacing blind geometric search with deterministic mapping and avoiding costly optimization. Second, geometry-aware dynamic filtering employs a quad-modal constraint field (normal/height/depth consistency) to reject moving vehicles and transient occlusions in real time. Third, illumination-robust fusion in CIELAB decouples luminance and chromaticity via adaptive L-channel weighting and depth-gradient suppression, reducing seams under abrupt lighting changes. ParkingTwin runs at 30+ FPS on an entry-level GTX 1660. On a 68,000 m^2 real-world dataset, it achieves SSIM 0.87 (+16.0%), delivers about 15x end-to-end speedup, and reduces GPU memory by 83.3% compared with state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that typically requires high-end GPUs (RTX 4090D).

While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment."}

As a result, recent work incorporates some 3D tasks (such as depth estimation) into VFM training. However, VFM performance remains inconsistent across other spatial tasks, raising the question of whether these models truly have spatial awareness or overfit to specific 3D objectives. To address this question, we introduce the Spatial Relation Recognition Task (SpaRRTa) benchmark, which evaluates the ability of VFMs to identify relative positions of objects in the image. Unlike traditional 3D objectives that focus on precise metric prediction (e.g., surface normal estimation), SpaRRTa probes a fundamental capability underpinning more advanced forms of human-like spatial understanding. SpaRRTa generates an arbitrary number of photorealistic images with diverse scenes and fully controllable object arrangements, along with freely accessible spatial annotations. Evaluating a range of state-of-the-art VFMs, we reveal significant disparities between their spatial reasoning abilities. Through our analysis, we provide insights into the mechanisms that support or hinder spatial awareness in modern VFMs. We hope that SpaRRTa will serve as a useful tool for guiding the development of future spatially aware visual models."}

We propose a three-stage framework, PRISM: Procedural Representation via Integrated Semantic and Multimodal analysis, that produces semantically grounded video summaries. PRISM combines adaptive visual sampling, label-driven keyframe anchoring, and contextual validation using a large language model (LLM). Our method ensures that selected frames reflect meaningful and procedural transitions while filtering out generic or hallucinated content, resulting in contextually coherent summaries across both domain-specific and instructional videos. We evaluate our method on instructional and activity datasets, using reference summaries for instructional videos. Despite sampling fewer than 5% of the original frames, our summaries retain 84% semantic content while improving over baselines by as much as 33%.

This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes."}

While recent generative approaches such as LLiMe (Angiulli et al., 2025b) attempt to mitigate this by employing Large Language Models for neighborhood generation, they rely on unconstrained paraphrasing that introduces confounding variables, making it difficult to isolate specific feature contributions. We introduce LIME-LLM, a framework that replaces random noise with hypothesis-driven, controlled perturbations. By enforcing a strict \"Single Mask-Single Sample\" protocol and employing distinct neutral infill and boundary infill strategies, LIME-LLM constructs fluent, on-manifold neighborhoods that rigorously isolate feature effects. We evaluate our method against established baselines (LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and the generative LLiMe baseline across three diverse benchmarks: CoLA, SST-2, and HateXplain using human-annotated rationales as ground truth.

To solve this challenge, most recent studies have shown significant interest in Video Glass Surface Detection (VGSD). We observe that objects in the reflection (or transmission) layer appear farther from the glass surfaces. Consequently, in video motion scenarios, the notable reflected (or transmitted) objects on the glass surface move slower than objects in non-glass regions within the same spatial plane, and this motion inconsistency can effectively reveal the presence of glass surfaces. Based on this observation, we propose a novel network, named MVGD-Net, for detecting glass surfaces in videos by leveraging motion inconsistency cues. Our MVGD-Net features three novel modules: the Cross-scale Multimodal Fusion Module (CMFM) that integrates extracted spatial features and estimated optical flow maps, the History Guided Attention Module (HGAM) and Temporal Cross Attention Module (TCAM), both of which further enhances temporal features. A Temporal-Spatial Decoder (TSD) is also introduced to fuse the spatial and temporal features for generating the glass region mask. Furthermore, for learning our network, we also propose a large-scale dataset, which comprises 312 diverse glass scenarios with a total of 19,268 frames.

Iterative refinements of these models have introduced an increasing number of architectural mechanisms, leading to increased complexity and computational costs. Nevertheless, systematic direct comparisons among these models remain limited. Existing benchmark tasks are either too simplistic to reveal substantial differences or excessively resource-intensive for experimentation. In this work, we propose a refined taxonomy of linear recurrent models and introduce SelectivBench, a set of lightweight and customizable synthetic benchmark tasks for systematically evaluating sequence models. SelectivBench specifically evaluates selectivity in sequence models at small to medium scale, such as the capacity to focus on relevant inputs while ignoring context-based distractors. It employs rule-based grammars to generate sequences with adjustable complexity, incorporating irregular gaps that intentionally violate transition rules. Evaluations of linear recurrent models on SelectivBench reveal performance patterns consistent with results from large-scale language tasks. Our analysis clarifies the roles of essential architectural features: gating and rapid forgetting mechanisms facilitate recall, in-state channel mixing is unnecessary for selectivity, but critical for generalization, and softmax attention remains dominant due to its memory capacity scaling with sequence length. Our benchmark enables targeted, efficient exploration of linear recurrent models and provides a controlled setting for studying behaviors observed in large-scale evaluations.

Project Website: https://kuan2jiu99.github.io/AQUA-Bench-demo/", "summary": "Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench.

Building on our prior work, this paper introduces SSVD-Outer (SSVD-O), an extension of the structured SVD-guided (SSVD) fine-tuning method. SSVD-O combines input acoustic feature space-associated inner transformations with output semantic feature space-associated outer transformations to enable scalable and balanced adaptation.

The proposed approach utilizes Multi-Scale Feature Fusion to enhance the extraction of features from benign and malignant tissues and combines Dice Loss and Focal Loss functions to improve the model's learning process, effectively reducing errors in binary breast cancer classification and achieving high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer images from INbreast, MIAS, and DDSM was preprocessed through data augmentation and contrast enhancement and resized to 227x227 pixels for model training. Leveraging the Transformer's ability to manage long-range dependencies with Self-Attention mechanisms, the proposed model achieved high accuracy in detecting cancerous masses, outperforming foundational models such as BreastNet, DeepMammo, Multi-Scale CNN, Swin-Unet, and SegFormer. The final evaluation results for the proposed model include an accuracy of 98.5\\%, sensitivity of 97.8\\%, specificity of 96.3\\%, F1-score of 98.2\\%, and overall precision of 97.9\\%.

In certain circumstances, however, obtaining a suitable line of sight may be impractical, dangerous, or even impossible. Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging addresses this challenge by reconstructing the scene from indirect measurements. Recently, passive NLOS methods that use an ordinary photograph of the subtle shadow cast onto a visible wall by the hidden scene have gained interest. These methods are currently limited to 1D or low-resolution 2D color imaging or to localizing a hidden object whose shape is approximately known. Here, we generalize this class of methods and demonstrate a 3D reconstruction of a hidden scene from an ordinary NLOS photograph. To achieve this, we propose a novel reformulation of the light transport model that conveniently decomposes the hidden scene into \\textit{light-occluding} and \\textit{non-light-occluding} components to yield a separable non-linear least squares (SNLLS) inverse problem. We develop two solutions: A gradient-based optimization method and a physics-inspired neural network approach, which we call Soft Shadow diffusion (SSD). Despite the challenging ill-conditioned inverse problem encountered here, our approaches are effective on numerous 3D scenes in real experimental scenarios. Moreover, SSD is trained in simulation but generalizes well to unseen classes in simulation and real-world NLOS scenes. SSD also shows surprising robustness to noise and ambient illumination."}

A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage."}

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes. Unlike existing attacks that treat modalities in isolation, MGEO employs an alternating gradient-based optimization strategy to exploit the deep cross-modal coupling within the VLM. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets using state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our coordinated attack significantly outperforms text-only and image-only baselines.

While post-training methods can improve ToM performance, we show that strong ToM capability can be recovered directly from the base model without any additional weight updates or verifications. Our approach builds on recent power-sampling methods (Karan & Du, 2025) that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample from sharpened sequence-level (rather than token-level) probability distributions of autoregressive language models.

Although physics-based simulation and strategic prototyping can reduce cost, meaningful evaluation is frequently constrained until an integrated prototype is built. This paper investigates whether a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) can predict information typically obtained through prototyping, including cost, performance, and perceived usability. We introduce a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method to emulate design feedback using OpenAI GPT-4o, grounded in prototyping data scraped from Instructables.com to increase access to relevant precedent. Two studies are reported. First, a controlled experiment compares GPT-RAG and human designers, who receive design sketches and predict cost, performance, and usability; predictions are evaluated against ground-truth results from physical prototypes. Second, we report an applied demonstration in which a physical prototype is produced from GPT-RAG recommendations and compared with a commercial baseline and a topology-optimized design. Results show that GPT-RAG provides more accurate cost and performance estimates than individual or crowd human estimates, while yielding comparable usability insights; the GPT-RAG-informed prototype also outperforms both comparison prototypes. Repeated querying with response averaging significantly improves accuracy, suggesting that LLMs can emulate crowd aggregation effects consistent with the law of large numbers."}

Deep learning is currently the state-of-the-art for brain tumor segmentation, yet it requires either large datasets or extensive computational resources that are inaccessible in most areas. This makes the problem increasingly difficult: state-of-the-art models use thousands of training cases and vast computational power, where performance drops sharply when either is limited. The top performer in the Brats GLI 2023 competition relied on supercomputers trained on over 92,000 augmented MRI scans using an AMD EPYC 7402 CPU, six NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs (48GB VRAM each), and 1024GB of RAM over multiple weeks. To address this, the Karhunen--Loève Expansion (KLE) was implemented as a feature extraction step on downsampled, z-score normalized MRI volumes. Each 240$\\times$240$\\times$155 multi-modal scan is reduced to four $48^3$ channels and compressed into 32 KL coefficients. The resulting approximate reconstruction enables a residual-based anomaly map, which is upsampled and added as a fifth channel to a compact 3D U-Net. All experiments were run on a consumer workstation (AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU, RTX 4060Ti (8GB VRAM), and 64GB RAM while using far fewer training cases. This model achieves post-processed Dice scores of 0.929 (WT), 0.856 (TC), and 0.821 (ET), with HD95 distances of 2.93, 6.78, and 10.35 voxels. These results are significantly better than the winning BraTS 2023 methodology for HD95 distances and WT dice scores. This demonstrates that a KLE-based residual anomaly map can dramatically reduce computational cost and data requirements while retaining state-of-the-art performance."}

An automated approach is necessary to minimize the effort needed from human experts. To address this, we propose CytoCLIP, a suite of vision-language models derived from pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) frameworks to learn joint visual-text representations of brain cytoarchitecture. CytoCLIP comprises two model variants: one is trained using low-resolution whole-region images to understand the overall cytoarchitectural pattern of an area, and the other is trained on high-resolution image tiles for detailed cellular-level representation. The training dataset is created from NISSL-stained histological sections of developing fetal brains of different gestational weeks. It includes 86 distinct regions for low-resolution images and 384 brain regions for high-resolution tiles. We evaluate the model's understanding of the cytoarchitecture and generalization ability using region classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Multiple experiments are performed under various data setups, including data from samples of different ages and sectioning planes.

Our approach directly learns a per-pixel Gaussian representation from the input images, and aggregates multi-view information using a transformer-based encoder that fuses image features from both DINOv3 and Stable Diffusion VAE. For real-time animation, we extend the explicit Gaussian representations with per-Gaussian features and introduce a lightweight MLP-based dynamic network to predict 3D Gaussian deformations from expression codes.

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments."}

This paper outlines our experiment in exploring the use of Representation Engineering (RepE) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to identify subspaces within the internal states of LLMs that represent a specific context.

We first introduce the recourse bandit problem, where a decision-maker must select both a treatment action and a feasible, minimal modification to mutable patient features. To address this problem, we develop the Generalized Linear Recourse Bandit (GLRB) algorithm. Building on this foundation, we propose LIBRA, a Language Model-Informed Bandit Recourse Algorithm that strategically combines domain knowledge from LLMs with the statistical rigor of bandit learning. LIBRA offers three key guarantees: (i) a warm-start guarantee, showing that LIBRA significantly reduces initial regret when LLM recommendations are near-optimal; (ii) an LLM-effort guarantee, proving that the algorithm consults the LLM only $O(\\log^2 T)$ times, where $T$ is the time horizon, ensuring long-term autonomy; and (iii) a robustness guarantee, showing that LIBRA never performs worse than a pure bandit algorithm even when the LLM is unreliable. We further establish matching lower bounds that characterize the fundamental difficulty of the recourse bandit problem and demonstrate the near-optimality of our algorithms.

We introduce MTV, a multi-task visual pretraining framework that jointly optimizes a shared backbone across vision-language contrastive, self-supervised, and dense spatial objectives. To mitigate the need for manual annotations, we leverage high-capacity \"expert\" models -- such as Depth Anything V2 and OWLv2 -- to synthesize dense, structured pseudo-labels at scale. Beyond the framework, we provide a systematic investigation into the mechanics of multi-task visual learning, analyzing: (i) the marginal gain of each objective, (ii) task synergies versus interference, and (iii) scaling behavior across varying data and model scales. Our results demonstrate that MTV achieves \"best-of-both-worlds\" performance, significantly enhancing fine-grained spatial reasoning without compromising global semantic understanding.

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses.

It monitors the evolution of land cover over time. Based on this, Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) introduces a new requirement. It aims to reduce the reliance on predefined categories. Existing training-free OVCD methods mostly use CLIP to identify categories. These methods also need extra models like DINO to extract features. However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks. Experiments on four public benchmarks (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, S2Looking, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving IoU scores of 67.2, 66.5, 24.5, and 27.1 (class-average), respectively, surpassing all previous methods."}

To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

The visual nervous system (VNS) is a good example that meets the above requirements because it learns from few visual experiences. Therefore, we used a Gabor filter, a model of the feature extractor of the VNS, as a preprocessor for CNNs to investigate the accuracy of the CNNs trained with small amounts of data. To evaluate how well CNNs trained on image data acquired under a limited variation of conditions generalize to data acquired under other conditions, we created an image dataset consisting of images acquired from different camera positions, and investigated the accuracy of the CNNs that trained using images acquired at a certain distance. The results were compared after training on multiple CNN architectures with and without Gabor filters as preprocessing.

Without structured oversight, such changes can degrade model behavior, increase operational cost, and reduce the usefulness of deployed systems. Although Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) streamlines the lifecycle of ML models, it provides limited support for addressing runtime uncertainties that influence the longer term sustainability of MLS. To support continued viability, these systems need a mechanism that detects when execution drifts outside acceptable bounds and adjusts system behavior in response. Despite the growing interest in sustainable and self-adaptive MLS, there has been limited work towards exemplars that allow researchers to study these challenges in MLOps pipelines. This paper presents Harmonica, a self-adaptation exemplar built on the HarmonE approach, designed to enable the sustainable operation of such pipelines. Harmonica introduces structured adaptive control through MAPE-K loop, separating high-level adaptation policy from low-level tactic execution. It continuously monitors sustainability metrics, evaluates them against dynamic adaptation boundaries, and automatically triggers architectural tactics when thresholds are violated. We demonstrate the tool through case studies in time series regression and computer vision, examining its ability to improve system stability and reduce manual intervention. The results show that Harmonica offers a practical and reusable foundation for enabling adaptive behavior in MLS that rely on MLOps pipelines for sustained operation."}

They are hazardous to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems further downstream. The classical methods of GLOF detection and prediction have so far mainly relied on hydrological modeling, threshold-based lake monitoring, and manual satellite image analysis. These approaches suffer from several drawbacks: slow updates, reliance on manual labor, and losses in accuracy when clouds interfere and/or lack on-site data. To tackle these challenges, we present IceWatch: a novel deep learning framework for GLOF prediction that incorporates both spatial and temporal perspectives. The vision component, RiskFlow, of IceWatch deals with Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery using a CNN-based classifier and predicts GLOF events based on the spatial patterns of snow, ice, and meltwater. Its tabular counterpart confirms this prediction by considering physical dynamics. TerraFlow models glacier velocity from NASA ITS_LIVE time series while TempFlow forecasts near-surface temperature from MODIS LST records; both are trained on long-term observational archives and integrated via harmonized preprocessing and synchronization to enable multimodal, physics-informed GLOF prediction. Both together provide cross-validation, which will improve the reliability and interpretability of GLOF detection. This system ensures strong predictive performance, rapid data processing for real-time use, and robustness to noise and missing information. IceWatch paves the way for automatic, scalable GLOF warning systems. It also holds potential for integration with diverse sensor inputs and global glacier monitoring activities."}

In this work, we consider the monocular setting, i.e. single-view input, for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). Here, the task is to predict a 3D point set of human skeletal joints from a single 2D input image. While by definition this is an ill-posed problem, recent work has presented methods that solve it with up to several-centimetre error. Typically, these methods employ a two-step approach, where the first step is to detect the 2D skeletal joints in the input image, followed by the step of 2D-to-3D lifting. We find that common lifting models fail when encountering a rotated input. We argue that learning a single human pose along with its in-plane rotations is considerably easier and more geometrically grounded than directly learning a point-to-point mapping. Furthermore, our intuition is that endowing the model with the notion of rotation equivariance without explicitly constraining its parameter space should lead to a more straightforward learning process than one with equivariance by design. Utilising the common HPE benchmarks, we confirm that the 2D rotation equivariance per se improves the model performance on human poses akin to rotations in the image plane, and can be efficiently and straightforwardly learned by augmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art equivariant-by-design methods."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation.

In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs."}

However, its potential for enhancing tasks that demand step-by-step logical deduction, such as mathematical reasoning, remains underexplored. A core limitation of existing ICL approaches is their static use of demonstrations: examples are pre-selected before inference and remain fixed, failing to adapt to the dynamic confusion points that often arise during multi-step reasoning such as ambiguous calculations or logical gaps. These unresolved confusion points can lead to cascading errors that degrade final accuracy. To tackle this issue, we propose Process In-Context Learning (PICL), a dynamic demonstration integration framework designed to boost mathematical reasoning by responding to real-time inference needs. PICL operates in two stages: 1)~it identifies potential confusion points by analyzing semantics and entropy in the reasoning process and summarizes their core characteristics; 2)~upon encountering these points, it retrieves relevant demonstrations from the demonstration pool that match the confusion context and inserts them directly into the ongoing reasoning process to guide subsequent steps. Experiments show that PICL outperforms baseline methods by mitigating mid-inference confusion, highlighting the value of adaptive demonstration insertion in complex mathematical reasoning."}

Recent search-augmented approaches attempt to address this limitation, but existing methods rely on indiscriminate whole-image retrieval that introduces substantial visual redundancy and noise, and lack deep iterative reflection, limiting their effectiveness on complex visual queries. To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search.

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Search-and-Replace Infilling (SRI), a framework that internalizes the agentic verification-and-editing mechanism into a unified, single-pass inference process. By structurally grounding edits via an explicit search phase, SRI harmonizes completion tasks with the instruction-following priors of Chat LLMs, extending the paradigm from static infilling to dynamic context-aware editing. We synthesize a high-quality dataset, SRI-200K, and fine-tune the SRI-Coder series. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that with minimal data (20k samples), SRI-Coder enables Chat models to surpass the completion performance of their Base counterparts. Crucially, unlike FIM-style tuning, SRI preserves general coding competencies and maintains inference latency comparable to standard FIM. We empower the entire Qwen3-Coder series with SRI, encouraging the developer community to leverage this framework for advanced auto-completion and assisted development."}

Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled \"train\" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because \"motorcycle\" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., \"Train (visual)\" -> \"Motorcycle (audio)\") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence."}

We further provide a statistical inference procedure by developing a new asymptotic theory for cross-validated prediction error. Finally, we apply this method to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that LLMs encode considerable predictive information for some economic variables but much less for others, suggesting that their value as substitutes for domain-specific data differs markedly across settings."}

Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server.

By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.\n  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal).

However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability. DExTeR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets spanning different medical domains (endoscopy, chest X-rays, and endoscopic ultrasound) highlighting its potential to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high detection accuracy."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data.

Traditional tools for formal safety verification struggle with the black-box nature of AI-driven systems and lack the flexibility needed to scale to the complexity of real-world applications. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach for safety verification and synthesis of black-box systems with discrete-time stochastic dynamics. We employ the concept of control barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. We provide the theoretical results on how to apply the approach to general classes of temporal logic specifications beyond safety. For the data-driven computation of safety barriers, we leverage a finite Fourier expansion to cast a typically intractable semi-infinite optimization problem as a linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. Our work moves beyond restrictive assumptions on system dynamics and uncertainty, as demonstrated on two case studies including a black-box system with a neural network controller."}

In this work, we address a fundamental limitation in current methods: the irreversible fusion of adjacent keypoint features caused by deep downsampling operations. This issue is triggered when semantically distinct keypoints fall within the same downsampled receptive field (e.g., 16x16 patches). To address this issue, we present SimpleMatch, a simple yet effective framework for semantic correspondence that delivers strong performance even at low resolutions. We propose a lightweight upsample decoder that progressively recovers spatial detail by upsampling deep features to 1/4 resolution, and a multi-scale supervised loss that ensures the upsampled features retain discriminative features across different spatial scales. In addition, we introduce sparse matching and window-based localization to optimize training memory usage and reduce it by 51%. At a resolution of 252x252 (3.3x smaller than current SOTA methods), SimpleMatch achieves superior performance with 84.1% PCK@0.1 on the SPair-71k benchmark.

STEC builds upon Spatio-Temporal Frame Entropy (STFE), which measures per-frame spatial information via entropy-based structural complexity, and evaluates sampled frames based on their temporal coverage and redundancy. By jointly modeling spatial information strength, temporal dispersion, and non-redundancy, STEC provides a principled and lightweight measure of sampling quality.\n  Experiments on the MSR-VTT test-1k benchmark demonstrate that STEC clearly differentiates common sampling strategies, including random, uniform, and content-aware methods. We further show that STEC reveals robustness patterns across individual videos that are not captured by average performance alone, highlighting its practical value as a general-purpose evaluation tool for efficient video understanding.\n  We emphasize that STEC is not designed to predict downstream task accuracy, but to provide a task-agnostic diagnostic signal for analyzing frame sampling behavior under constrained budgets."}

We introduce a scalable bias-auditing framework using named entities as probes to measure structural disparities in model behavior. We show that synthetic data reliably reproduces bias patterns observed in natural text, enabling large-scale analysis. Using this approach, we conduct the largest bias audit to date, comprising 1.9 billion data points across multiple entity types, tasks, languages, models, and prompting strategies. Our results reveal systematic biases: models penalize right-wing politicians, favor left-wing politicians, prefer Western and wealthy nations over the Global South, favor Western companies, and penalize firms in the defense and pharmaceutical sectors. While instruction tuning reduces bias, increasing model scale amplifies it, and prompting in Chinese or Russian does not attenuate Western-aligned preferences. These results indicate that LLMs should undergo rigorous auditing before deployment in high-stakes applications."}

Recent works, such as NavCoT and NavGPT-2, demonstrate the potential of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for improving interpretability and long-horizon planning. Moreover, multimodal extensions like OctoNav-R1 and CoT-VLA further validate CoT as a promising pathway toward human-like navigation reasoning. However, existing approaches face critical drawbacks: purely textual CoTs lack spatial grounding and easily overfit to sparse annotated reasoning steps, while multimodal CoTs incur severe token inflation by generating imagined visual observations, making real-time navigation impractical. In this work, we propose FantasyVLN, a unified implicit reasoning framework that preserves the benefits of CoT reasoning without explicit token overhead. Specifically, imagined visual tokens are encoded into a compact latent space using a pretrained Visual AutoRegressor (VAR) during CoT reasoning training, and the model jointly learns from textual, visual, and multimodal CoT modes under a unified multi-CoT strategy. At inference, our model performs direct instruction-to-action mapping while still enjoying reasoning-aware representations. Extensive experiments on LH-VLN show that our approach achieves reasoning-aware yet real-time navigation, improving success rates and efficiency while reducing inference latency by an order of magnitude compared to explicit CoT methods."}

To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains.

Tasks like multilingual transliteration, code refactoring, grammatical correction or text normalization often rely on local dependencies where the full modeling capacity of AR models can be overkill, creating a trade-off between their high accuracy and high inference latency. While non-autoregressive (NAR) models offer speed, they typically suffer from hallucinations and poor length control. To explore this trade-off, we focus on the multilingual transliteration task in Indic languages and introduce NADIR, a novel NAR architecture designed to strike a balance between speed and accuracy. NADIR integrates a Differential Transformer and a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism, enabling it to robustly model complex character mappings without sequential dependencies. NADIR achieves over a 13x speed-up compared to the state-of-the-art AR baseline. It maintains a competitive mean Character Error Rate of 15.78%, compared to 14.44% for the AR model and 21.88% for a standard NAR equivalent. Importantly, NADIR reduces Repetition errors by 49.53%, Substitution errors by 24.45%, Omission errors by 32.92%, and Insertion errors by 16.87%. This work provides a practical blueprint for building fast and reliable NAR systems, effectively bridging the gap between AR accuracy and the demands of real-time, large-scale deployment."}

By enforcing haze consistency and systematic equivariance, EID can recover clear patterns directly from raw, hazy images. Additionally, we propose an adversarial learning strategy to model unknown haze physics and facilitate EID learning. Experiments on two scientific image dehazing benchmarks (including cell microscopy and medical endoscopy) and on natural image dehazing have demonstrated that EID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. By unifying equivariant learning with modelling haze physics, we hope that EID will enable more versatile and effective haze removal in scientific imaging. Code and datasets will be published."}

While previous work has shown that LLMs can deceive in controlled tasks, less is known about their ability to deceive using natural language in social contexts. In this paper, we study deception in the Social Deduction Game (SDG) Mafia, where success is dependent on deceiving others through conversation. Unlike previous SDG studies, we use an asynchronous multi-agent framework which better simulates realistic social contexts. We simulate 35 Mafia games with GPT-4o LLM agents. We then create a Mafia Detector using GPT-4-Turbo to analyze game transcripts without player role information to predict the mafia players. We use prediction accuracy as a surrogate marker for deception quality. We compare this prediction accuracy to that of 28 human games and a random baseline. Results show that the Mafia Detector's mafia prediction accuracy is lower on LLM games than on human games. The result is consistent regardless of the game days and the number of mafias detected. This indicates that LLMs blend in better and thus deceive more effectively. We also release a dataset of LLM Mafia transcripts to support future research. Our findings underscore both the sophistication and risks of LLM deception in social contexts."}

However, this data is ultimately the product of human brains, the filtered projection of a deeper neural complexity. In this paper, we explore a new strategy for artificial intelligence: moving beyond surface-level statistical regularities by training foundation models directly on human brain data. We hypothesize that neuroimaging data could open a window into elements of human cognition that are not accessible through observable actions, and argue that this additional knowledge could be used, alongside classical training data, to overcome some of the current limitations of foundation models. While previous research has demonstrated the possibility to train classical machine learning or deep learning models on neural patterns, this path remains largely unexplored for high-level cognitive functions. Here, we classify the current limitations of foundation models, as well as the promising brain regions and cognitive processes that could be leveraged to address them, along four levels: perception, valuation, execution, and integration. Then, we propose two methods that could be implemented to prioritize the use of limited neuroimaging data for strategically chosen, high-value steps in foundation model training: reinforcement learning from human brain (RLHB) and chain of thought from human brain (CoTHB). We also discuss the potential implications for agents, artificial general intelligence, and artificial superintelligence, as well as the ethical, social, and technical challenges and opportunities. We argue that brain-trained foundation models could represent a realistic and effective middle ground between continuing to scale current architectures and exploring alternative, neuroscience-inspired solutions."}

Their impressive generative capability allows them to approximate sampling from a prior distribution, which alongside a known likelihood function permits posterior sampling without retraining the model. While recent methods have made strides in advancing the accuracy of posterior sampling, the majority focuses on single-image inverse problems. However, for modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is common to acquire multiple complementary measurements, each low-resolution along a different axis. In this work, we generalize common diffusion-based inverse single-image problem solvers for multi-image super-resolution (MISR) MRI. We show that the DPS likelihood correction allows an exactly-separable gradient decomposition across independently acquired measurements, enabling MISR without constructing a joint operator, modifying the diffusion model, or increasing network function evaluations.

In a prospectively collected cohort where all patients underwent surgery, we ask whether models using only pre-operative clinical data could have identified those who would have poor outcomes, i.e. those who should have avoided surgery. We benchmark supervised ML (logistic regression, tree ensembles, and an in-house MLP) against generative AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity), giving each the same structured inputs and constraining outputs to binary recommendations with confidence. Our best ML model (MLP) achieves 85 % accuracy with superior calibration and decision-curve net benefit. GenAI models underperform on discrimination and calibration across zero-shot setting.

The performance of DIP depends on the network architecture and the stopping point of its iterative process. Optimizing these parameters for a new image requires time, restricting DIP application in domains where many images need to be processed. Focusing on fluorescence microscopy data, we hypothesize that similar images share comparable optimal parameter configurations for DIP-based denoising, potentially enabling optimization-free DIP for fluorescence microscopy. We generated a calibration (n=110) and validation set (n=55) of semantically different images from an open-source dataset for a network architecture search targeted towards ideal U-net architectures and stopping points. The calibration set represented our transfer basis. The validation set enabled the assessment of which image similarity criterion yields the best results. We then implemented AUTO-DIP, a pipeline for automatic parameter transfer, and compared it to the originally published DIP configuration (baseline) and a state-of-the-art image-specific variational denoising approach. We show that a parameter transfer from the calibration dataset to a test image based on only image metadata similarity (e.g., microscope type, imaged specimen) leads to similar and better performance than a transfer based on quantitative image similarity measures. AUTO-DIP outperforms the baseline DIP (DIP with original DIP parameters) as well as the variational denoising approaches for several open-source test datasets of varying complexity, particularly for very noisy inputs.

In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \\textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs.

In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable.

These vehicles are typically equipped with active sensors, such as LiDAR, which scan the environment in predefined patterns. 3D box annotation based on data from such sensors is challenging in dynamic scenarios, where objects are observed at different timestamps, hence different positions. Without proper handling of this phenomenon, systematic errors are prone to being introduced in the box annotations. Our work is the first to discover such annotation errors in widely used, publicly available datasets. Through our novel offline estimation method, we correct the annotations so that they follow physically feasible trajectories and achieve spatial and temporal consistency with the sensor data. For the first time, we define metrics for this problem; and we evaluate our method on the Argoverse 2, MAN TruckScenes, and our proprietary datasets. Our approach increases the quality of box annotations by more than 17% in these datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the annotation errors in them and find that the original annotations are misplaced by up to 2.5 m, with highly dynamic objects being the most affected. Finally, we test the impact of the errors in benchmarking and find that the impact is larger than the improvements that state-of-the-art methods typically achieve with respect to the previous state-of-the-art methods; showing that accurate annotations are essential for correct interpretation of performance.

The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions."}

In this work, we show that many of these approaches implicitly conflate two fundamental and independent design choices: (i) the sampling geometry, which determines which samples dominate the gradient signal, and (ii) the optimization geometry, which determines how deviations in value are penalized. We formalize this observation by expressing alignment as the minimization of a generalized distance between policy energy and target energy, parameterized by an alpha-divergence-based sampling weight and a Bregman-divergence-based value metric. We demonstrate that the commonly used KL divergence induces an exponential penalty on unbounded value signals, leading to numerical instability and vanishing gradients in high-confidence regimes. To address this issue, we propose Orthogonalized Policy Optimization (OPO), a framework that explicitly decouples sampling geometry from optimization geometry. By combining alpha-weighted importance sampling with a chi-square-induced quadratic regularization in ratio coordinates, OPO yields a simple and well-conditioned objective with linear gradient dynamics. This formulation maintains stable optimization while preserving peak-seeking behavior and avoids gradient saturation even when model confidence is high. Our analysis positions OPO as a unifying perspective on existing alignment methods and provides a principled foundation for robust reasoning-oriented training."}

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models.

To distinguish genuine predictive capability from memorization-based performance, we analyze performance decay across temporally distinct market regimes, incorporating several quantitative baselines to establish performance thresholds. We evaluate prominent open-source LLMs -- Llama 3.1 (8B and 70B) and DeepSeek 3.2 -- against a family of Point-in-Time LLMs (Pitinf-Small, Pitinf-Medium, and frontier-level model Pitinf-Large) from PiT-Inference. Results reveal significant lookahead bias in standard LLMs, as measured with alpha decay, unlike Pitinf models, which demonstrate improved generalization and reasoning abilities as they scale in size.

Despite the critical importance of these molecular alterations, existing computational models often lack interpretability, and fail to integrate essential physicochemical interaction. To overcome these limitations, we propose SheafLapNet, a unified predictive framework grounded in the mathematical theory of Topological Deep Learning (TDL) and Persistent Sheaf Laplacian (PSL). Unlike standard Topological Data Analysis (TDA) tools such as persistent homology, which are often insensitive to heterogeneous information, PSL explicitly encodes specific physical and chemical information such as partial charges directly into the topological analysis. SheafLapNet synergizes these sheaf-theoretic invariants with advanced protein transformer features and auxiliary physical descriptors to capture intrinsic molecular interactions in a multiscale and mechanistic manner. To validate our framework, we employ rigorous benchmarks for both regression and classification tasks. For stability prediction, we utilize the comprehensive S2648 and S350 datasets. For solubility prediction, we employ the PON-Sol2 dataset, which provides annotations for increased, decreased, or neutral solubility changes. By integrating these multi-perspective features, SheafLapNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across these diverse benchmarks, demonstrating that sheaf-theoretic modeling significantly enhances both interpretability and generalizability in predicting mutation-induced structural and functional changes."}

Nevertheless, high-noise audio inputs are prone to introducing adverse interference into the feature fusion process. To mitigate this, recent AVSR methods often adopt mask-based strategies to filter audio noise during feature interaction and fusion, yet such methods risk discarding semantically relevant information alongside noise. In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions."}

In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method. Meanwhile, we scale our method to real and complex scenarios, allowing different clients to adopt various methods, and extend our framework to further improve performance. Numerous experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. The code is released upon acceptance."}

To address this, we introduce V-Skip that reformulates token pruning as a Visual-Anchored Information Bottleneck (VA-IB) optimization problem. V-Skip employs a dual-path gating mechanism that weighs token importance through both linguistic surprisal and cross-modal attention flow, effectively rescuing visually salient anchors. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL and Llama-3.2 families demonstrate that V-Skip achieves a $2.9\\times$ speedup with negligible accuracy loss.

We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts."}

The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL).

Training-time Defense involves modifying the training process, typically through adversarial fine-tuning to improve the robustness to adversarial examples. While effective, this approach requires substantial computational resources and may not generalize across all adversarial attacks. Test-time Adaptation Defense focuses on adapting the model at inference time by updating its parameters to handle unlabeled adversarial examples, offering flexibility but often at the cost of increased complexity and computational overhead. Training-free Defense avoids modifying the model itself, instead focusing on altering the adversarial inputs or their feature embeddings, which enforces input perturbations to mitigate the impact of attacks without additional training.

The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases.

Project Website: https://kuan2jiu99.github.io/AQUA-Bench-demo/", "summary": "Recent advances in audio-aware large language models have shown strong performance on audio question answering. However, existing benchmarks mainly cover answerable questions and overlook the challenge of unanswerable ones, where no reliable answer can be inferred from the audio. Such cases are common in real-world settings, where questions may be misleading, ill-posed, or incompatible with the information. To address this gap, we present AQUA-Bench, a benchmark for Audio Question Unanswerability Assessment. It systematically evaluates three scenarios: Absent Answer Detection (the correct option is missing), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (choices are categorically mismatched with the question), and Incompatible Audio Question Detection (the question is irrelevant or lacks sufficient grounding in the audio). By assessing these cases, AQUA-Bench offers a rigorous measure of model reliability and promotes the development of audio-language systems that are more robust and trustworthy. Our experiments suggest that while models excel on standard answerable tasks, they often face notable challenges with unanswerable ones, pointing to a blind spot in current audio-language understanding."}

We identify the \"almost-there\" phenomenon in long-context reasoning, where trajectories are largely correct but fail at the final step, and attribute this failure to two factors: (1) the lack of high reasoning density in long-context QA data that push LLMs beyond mere grounding toward sophisticated multi-hop reasoning; and (2) the loss of valuable learning signals during long-context RL training due to the indiscriminate penalization of partially correct trajectories with incorrect outcomes. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose DeepReasonQA, a KG-driven synthesis framework that controllably constructs high-difficulty, multi-hop long-context QA pairs with inherent reasoning chains. Building on this, we introduce Long-context Process Advantage Shaping (LongPAS), a simple yet effective method that performs fine-grained credit assignment by evaluating reasoning steps along Validity and Relevance dimensions, which captures critical learning signals from \"almost-there\" trajectories. Experiments on three long-context reasoning benchmarks show that our approach substantially outperforms RLVR baselines and matches frontier LLMs while using far fewer parameters.

To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes. We further propose a warping-free generative editing pipeline that supports object insertion, removal, and transformation via regeneration rather than pixel deformation. To preserve object identity and consistency across edits, we condition the diffusion process on reference images using IP-Adapter, enabling coherent object appearance throughout interactive 3D editing while maintaining global scene coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that POCI-Diff produces high-quality images consistent with the specified 3D layouts and edits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and layout adherence while eliminating warping-induced geometric artifacts."}

This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies.

In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is subsequently applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings by enabling interactions across temporal patches. In the second stage, a Transformer encoder processes the resulting token sequence to model inter-patch temporal dependencies and generate per-patch forecasts. Experiments conducted on synthetic multivariate time-series data with controlled static and dynamic factors demonstrate that the proposed patch-based tokenization strategy achieves competitive forecasting performance compared to convolutional and patch-based Transformer baselines.

They primarily rely on either transforming the multimodal query into a single text using image-to-text models or employing large language models for target image description generation, approaches that often fail to capture complementary visual information and complete semantic context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval method with Complementary Visual-Semantic Integration (CVSI). Specifically, CVSI leverages three key components: (1) Visual Information Extraction, which not only extracts global image features but also uses a pre-trained mapping network to convert the image into a pseudo token, combining it with the modification text and the objects most likely to be added. (2) Semantic Information Extraction, which involves using a pre-trained captioning model to generate multiple captions for the reference image, followed by leveraging an LLM to generate the modified captions and the objects most likely to be added. (3) Complementary Information Retrieval, which integrates information extracted from both the query and database images to retrieve the target image, enabling the system to efficiently handle retrieval queries in a variety of situations.

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training.

We present Multimodal Generative Engine Optimization (MGEO), a novel adversarial framework that enables a malicious actor to unfairly promote a target product by jointly optimizing imperceptible image perturbations and fluent textual suffixes.

A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks.

Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation."}

Specifically, the model first captures local temporal and spatiotemporal dynamics through time-domain and time-space convolutional branches, and then aligns these features via a cross-attention mechanism that enables interaction between branches at each stage. Subsequently, a hierarchical Transformer fusion structure is employed to encode global dependencies across all feature stages, while a customized Dynamic Tanh normalization module is introduced to replace traditional Layer Normalization in order to enhance training stability and reduce redundancy. Extensive experiments are conducted on two representative benchmark datasets, BCI Competition IV-2b and CHB-MIT, covering both event-related cross-subject classification and continuous seizure prediction tasks. Results show that HCFT achieves 80.83% average accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.6165 on BCI IV-2b, as well as 99.10% sensitivity, 0.0236 false positives per hour, and 98.82% specificity on CHB-MIT, consistently outperforming over ten state-of-the-art baseline methods.

When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\\max_i |A_i|)\\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size.

In the encoder, we reduce the equivariance from SO(3) to SO(2) using a novel SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer, an extension of Vector Neurons. We show that our SO(2)-equivariant fully connected layer outperforms standard Vector Neurons when used in our SO(2)-equivariant model. Compared to previous methods, our variational autoencoder enables smoother interpolation in latent space and offers a more well-behaved latent space."}

In this work, we introduce ParaMETA, a unified and flexible framework for learning and controlling speaking styles directly from speech. Unlike existing methods that rely on single-task models or cross-modal alignment, ParaMETA learns disentangled, task-specific embeddings by projecting speech into dedicated subspaces for each type of style. This design reduces inter-task interference, mitigates negative transfer, and allows a single model to handle multiple paralinguistic tasks such as emotion, gender, age, and language classification. Beyond recognition, ParaMETA enables fine-grained style control in Text-To-Speech (TTS) generative models. It supports both speech- and text-based prompting and allows users to modify one speaking styles while preserving others. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ParaMETA outperforms strong baselines in classification accuracy and generates more natural and expressive speech, while maintaining a lightweight and efficient model suitable for real-world applications."}

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance."}

This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow.

We utilize a collection of video interviews from the USC Shoah Foundation's Visual History Archive with Holocaust survivors as they recount their experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Inspired by pretraining methods on language models, we develop a novel gaze detection model that uses self-supervised eye movement reconstruction that can effectively leverage unlabeled video. We use this model's encoder embeddings to fine-tune models on two downstream tasks related to emotional expression. The first is aligning eye movement with directional emotion estimates from speech. The second task is using eye gaze as a predictor of three momentary manifestations of emotional behaviors: laughing, crying/sobbing, and sighing. We find our new model is predictive of emotion outcomes and observe a positive correlation between pretraining performance and emotion processing performance for both experiments. We conclude self-supervised eye movement reconstruction is an effective method for encoding the affective signal they carry."}

Most existing datasets are captured from ground-level perspectives, and models trained on them often struggle to transfer to drastically different domains such as aerial views. This paper examines how curriculum-based training strategies can improve generalization to unseen real aerial-view data without using any real aerial data during training.\n  We explore curriculum learning for cross-view action recognition using two out-of-domain sources: synthetic aerial-view data and real ground-view data. Our results on the evaluation on order of training (fine-tuning on synthetic aerial data vs. real ground data) shows that fine-tuning on real ground data but differ in how they transition from synthetic to real. The first uses a two-stage curriculum with direct fine-tuning, while the second applies a progressive curriculum that expands the dataset in multiple stages before fine-tuning. We evaluate both methods on the REMAG dataset using SlowFast (CNN-based) and MViTv2 (Transformer-based) architectures.\n  Results show that combining the two out-of-domain datasets clearly outperforms training on a single domain, whether real ground-view or synthetic aerial-view. Both curriculum strategies match the top-1 accuracy of simple dataset combination while offering efficiency gains. With the two-step fine-tuning method, SlowFast achieves up to a 37% reduction in iterations and MViTv2 up to a 30% reduction compared to simple combination. The multi-step progressive approach further reduces iterations, by up to 9% for SlowFast and 30% for MViTv2, relative to the two-step method. These findings demonstrate that curriculum-based training can maintain comparable performance (top-1 accuracy within 3% range) while improving training efficiency in cross-view action recognition."}

The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios."}

Our methodology provides a relative measure of model performance: when required to generate exactly five meanings, both strong and weak models may resort to meanings from dominant languages, but semantically stronger models do so later in the generation sequence, producing more true meanings from the target language before failing, while weaker models resort to dominant-language meanings earlier in the sequence. We evaluate a diverse set of open and closed multilingual LLMs using a structured meaning generation task across nine languages, employing a carefully curated benchmark of 100 high-polysemy English words.

This ability is crucial not only for advancing 3D generation research but also for practical applications in animation, editing, and digital content creation. Existing approaches either operate directly on geometry, limiting them to shape-only morphing while neglecting textures, or extend 2D interpolation strategies into 3D, which often causes semantic ambiguity, structural misalignment, and texture blurring. These challenges underscore the necessity to jointly preserve geometric consistency, texture alignment, and robustness throughout the transition process. To address this, we propose Interp3D, a novel training-free framework for textured 3D morphing. It harnesses generative priors and adopts a progressive alignment principle to ensure both geometric fidelity and texture coherence. Starting from semantically aligned interpolation in condition space, Interp3D enforces structural consistency via SLAT (Structured Latent)-guided structure interpolation, and finally transfers appearance details through fine-grained texture fusion. For comprehensive evaluations, we construct a dedicated dataset, Interp3DData, with graded difficulty levels and assess generation results from fidelity, transition smoothness, and plausibility. Both quantitative metrics and human studies demonstrate the significant advantages of our proposed approach over previous methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/xiaolul2/Interp3D."}

However, for nearby or crossing speakers, robust tracking becomes difficult and spatial cues less effective for enhancement. By incorporating the processed recording as additional guide into both algorithms, our novel joint autoregressive framework leverages temporal-spectral correlations of speech to resolve spatially challenging speaker constellations. Consequently, our proposed method significantly improves tracking and enhancement of closely spaced speakers, consistently outperforming comparable non-autoregressive methods on a synthetic dataset.

PMCE constructs a nonparametric knowledge bank that stores visual statistics for each category as well as CLIP-encoded class name embeddings of the base classes. At meta-test time, the most relevant base classes are retrieved based on the similarities of class name embeddings for each novel category. These statistics are then aggregated into category-specific prior information and fused with the support set prototypes via a simple MAP update. Simultaneously, a frozen BLIP captioner provides label-free instance-level image descriptions, and a lightweight enhancer trained on base classes optimizes both support prototypes and query features under an inductive protocol with a consistency regularization to stabilize noisy captions.

However, less is known about why such mechanisms are present in the first place. Theory suggests that primate decision making mechanisms, and their resultant behavioral abilities, emerged to maximize reward in the face of noisy, temporally evolving information. To test this theory, we trained an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network using reinforcement learning on a noisy perceptual discrimination task. Networks learned several key abilities of primate-like decision making including trading off speed for accuracy, and flexibly changing their mind in the face of new information. Internal dynamics of these networks suggest that these abilities were supported by similar decision mechanisms as those observed in primate neurophysiological studies. These results provide experimental support for key pressures that gave rise to the primate ability to make flexible decisions."}

While these mechanisms have been combined before, compression has typically been applied only to uplink (client-to-server) communication, leaving the downlink (server-to-client) side unaddressed. In practice, however, both directions are costly. We propose BiCoLoR, the first algorithm to combine local training with bidirectional compression using arbitrary unbiased compressors. This joint design achieves accelerated complexity guarantees in both convex and strongly convex heterogeneous settings. Empirically, BiCoLoR outperforms existing algorithms and establishes a new standard in communication efficiency."}

While literature data are valuable for validation and reuse, the lack of machine-readable workflow descriptions prevents large-scale curation and systematic comparison. Existing text-mining approaches are insufficient to extract complete computational workflows with their associated parameters. An ontology-driven, large language model (LLM)-assisted framework is introduced for the automated extraction and structuring of computational workflows from the literature. The approach focuses on density functional theory-based stacking fault energy (SFE) calculations in hexagonal close-packed magnesium and its binary alloys, and uses a multi-stage filtering strategy together with prompt-engineered LLM extraction applied to method sections and tables. Extracted information is unified into a canonical schema and aligned with established materials ontologies (CMSO, ASMO, and PLDO), enabling the construction of a knowledge graph using atomRDF. The resulting knowledge graph enables systematic comparison of reported SFE values and supports the structured reuse of computational protocols. While full computational reproducibility is still constrained by missing or implicit metadata, the framework provides a foundation for organizing and contextualizing published results in a semantically interoperable form, thereby improving transparency and reusability of computational materials data."}

DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability."}

Moreover, existing generative enhancement methods tend to be 3D-agnostic, resulting in inconsistent structures across views, especially in unseen regions. To overcome these challenges, we design a Dual-Domain Detail Perception Module, which enables handling high-resolution images without being limited by the ViT backbone, and endows Gaussians with additional features to store high-frequency details. We develop a feature-guided diffusion network, which can preserve high-frequency details during the restoration process.

Combining machine learning (ML) algorithms with accurate single-phase flowmeters has therefore received extensive research attention in recent years. The Coriolis mass flowmeter is a widely used single-phase meter that provides direct mass flow measurements, which ML models can be trained to correct, thereby reducing measurement errors in multiphase conditions. This paper demonstrates that preserving temporal information significantly improves model performance in such scenarios. We compare a multilayer perceptron, a windowed multilayer perceptron, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) on three-phase air-water-oil flow data from 342 experiments. Whereas prior work typically compresses each experiment into a single averaged sample, we instead compute short-time averages from within each experiment and train models that preserve temporal information at several downsampling intervals. The CNN performed best at 0.25 Hz with approximately 95 % of relative errors below 13 %, a normalized root mean squared error of 0.03, and a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 4.3 %, clearly outperforming the best single-averaged model and demonstrating that short-time averaging within individual experiments is preferable.

Second, existing CLAP models are restricted to short and fixed duration, which constrains their usage in real-world scenarios with variable-duration audio. Third, the standard contrastive training objective operates on global representations, which may hinder the learning of dense, fine-grained audio features. To address these challenges, we introduce Scalable Language-Audio Pretraining (SLAP), which scales language-audio pretraining to 109 million audio-text pairs with variable audio durations and incorporates multiple training objectives. SLAP unifies contrastive loss with additional self-supervised and captioning losses in a single-stage training, facilitating the learning of richer dense audio representations. The proposed SLAP model achieves new state-of-the-art performance on audio-text retrieval and zero-shot audio classification tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks."}

A 2D ODT image (B-scan) is generated by sequentially acquiring 1D depth-resolved raw A-scans (A-line) along the lateral axis (B-line), followed by Doppler phase-subtraction analysis. To ensure high-fidelity B-scan images, current practices rely on dense sampling, which prolongs scanning time, increases storage demands, and limits the capture of rapid blood flow dynamics. Recent studies have explored sparse sampling of raw A-scans to alleviate these limitations, but their effectiveness is hindered by the conservative sampling rates and the uniform modeling of flow and background signals. In this study, we introduce a novel blood flow-aware network, named ASBA (A-line ROI State space model and B-line phase Attention), to reconstruct ODT images from highly sparsely sampled raw A-scans. Specifically, we propose an A-line ROI state space model to extract sparsely distributed flow features along the A-line, and a B-line phase attention to capture long-range flow signals along each B-line based on phase difference. Moreover, we introduce a flow-aware weighted loss function that encourages the network to prioritize the accurate reconstruction of flow signals. Extensive experiments on real animal data demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms existing state-of-the-art reconstruction methods."}

In this work, we propose an end-to-end noise-robust AVSR framework coupled with speech enhancement, eliminating the need for explicit noise mask generation. This framework leverages a Conformer-based bottleneck fusion module to implicitly refine noisy audio features with video assistance. By reducing modality redundancy and enhancing inter-modal interactions, our method preserves speech semantic integrity to achieve robust recognition performance. Experimental evaluations on the public LRS3 benchmark suggest that our method outperforms prior advanced mask-based baselines under noisy conditions."}

However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate."}

Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., \"bruaf\") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation."}

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints.

We propose Multiscale Interaction Mixture of Experts (MI-MoE) to adapt interaction modeling across geometric regimes. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a distance-cutoff expert ensemble that explicitly captures short-, mid-, and long-range interactions without committing to a single cutoff; (2) we design a topological gating encoder that routes inputs to experts using filtration-based descriptors, including persistent homology features, summarizing how connectivity evolves across radii; and (3) we show that MI-MoE is a plug-in module that consistently improves multiple strong 3D molecular backbones across diverse molecular and polymer property prediction benchmark datasets, covering both regression and classification tasks.

The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines.

We introduce Multi-Focus Attention Instruction (MFAI), a semantic probe to disentangle these mechanisms by explicitly steering attention towards selected positions. Across 5 LLMs on two multi-hop QA tasks (MuSiQue and NeoQA), we establish the \"Weakest Link Law\": multi-hop reasoning performance collapses to the performance level of the least visible evidence. Crucially, this failure is governed by absolute position rather than the linear distance between facts (performance variance $<3%$). We further identify a duality in attention steering: while matched MFAI resolves recognition bottlenecks, improving accuracy by up to 11.5% in low-visibility positions, misleading MFAI triggers confusion in real-world tasks but is successfully filtered in synthetic tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that \"thinking\" models that utilize System-2 reasoning, effectively locate and integrate the required information, matching gold-only baselines even in noisy, long-context settings."}

Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively."}

Beyond standard autoencoder objectives, we regularize these keep probabilities to be monotonically decreasing along the sequence and explicitly align their distribution with an image-level complexity measure. As a result, STAT produces length-adaptive 1D visual tokens that are naturally compatible with causal 1D autoregressive (AR) visual generative models. On ImageNet-1k, equipping vanilla causal AR models with STAT yields competitive or superior visual generation quality compared to other probabilistic model families, while also exhibiting favorable scaling behavior that has been elusive in prior vanilla AR visual generation attempts."}

A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images.

While ex-ante harm identification and prevention have advanced, Responsible AI scholarship remains underdeveloped in addressing ex-post liability. Core legal questions regarding liability allocation, responsibility attribution, and remedial effectiveness remain insufficiently theorized and institutionalized, particularly for transboundary harms and risks that transcend national jurisdictions. Drawing on contemporary AI risk analyses, we argue that such harms are structurally embedded in global AI supply chains and are likely to escalate in frequency and severity due to cross-border deployment, data infrastructures, and uneven national oversight capacities. Consequently, territorially bounded liability regimes are increasingly inadequate. Using a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this paper examines compensation and liability frameworks from high-risk transnational domains - including vaccine injury schemes, systemic financial risk governance, commercial nuclear liability, and international environmental regimes - to distill transferable legal design principles such as strict liability, risk pooling, collective risk-sharing, and liability channelling, while highlighting potential structural constraints on their application to AI-related harms. Situated within an international order shaped more by AI arms race dynamics than cooperative governance, the paper outlines the contours of a global AI accountability and compensation architecture, emphasizing the tension between geopolitical rivalry and the collective action required to govern transboundary AI risks effectively."}

However, most existing video customization methods rely on reference images or task-specific temporal priors, failing to fully exploit the rich spatio-temporal information inherent in videos, thereby limiting flexibility and generalization in video generation. To address these limitations, we propose OmniTransfer, a unified framework for spatio-temporal video transfer. It leverages multi-view information across frames to enhance appearance consistency and exploits temporal cues to enable fine-grained temporal control. To unify various video transfer tasks, OmniTransfer incorporates three key designs: Task-aware Positional Bias that adaptively leverages reference video information to improve temporal alignment or appearance consistency; Reference-decoupled Causal Learning separating reference and target branches to enable precise reference transfer while improving efficiency; and Task-adaptive Multimodal Alignment using multimodal semantic guidance to dynamically distinguish and tackle different tasks. Extensive experiments show that OmniTransfer outperforms existing methods in appearance (ID and style) and temporal transfer (camera movement and video effects), while matching pose-guided methods in motion transfer without using pose, establishing a new paradigm for flexible, high-fidelity video generation."}

Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique.

We term this phenomenon explanation multiplicity: multiple internally valid but substantively different explanations for the same decision. We present a methodology to characterize multiplicity in feature-attribution explanations and to disentangle sources due to model training/selection from stochasticity intrinsic to the explanation pipeline. We further show that apparent stability depends on the metric: magnitude-based distances can remain near zero while rank-based measures reveal substantial churn in the identity and ordering of top features. To contextualize observed disagreement, we derive randomized baseline values under plausible null models. Across datasets, model classes, and confidence regimes, we find explanation multiplicity is pervasive and persists even for high-confidence predictions, highlighting the need for metrics and baselines that match the intended use of explanations."}

For the probabilistic model, a continuous ranked probability score objective is added to improve the calibration of the ensemble forecasts. When trained, the emulators achieve more than two orders of magnitude speedup in generating the next time step relative to the original simulation on a single GPU compared to 100 CPUs for the Vlasiator runs, while closely matching physical magnetospheric response of the different runs. These results demonstrate that machine learning offers a way to make hybrid-Vlasov simulation tractable for real-time use while providing forecast uncertainty."}

Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar."}

In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\\% of trials.

IPEC maintains a dynamic auxiliary set by selectively incorporating query samples that are classified with high confidence. To ensure sample quality, we design a robust dual-filtering mechanism that assesses each query sample based on both global prediction confidence and local discriminative ability. By aggregating this auxiliary set with the support set in subsequent tasks, IPEC builds progressively more stable and representative prototypes, effectively reducing its reliance on the initial support set. We ground this approach in a Bayesian interpretation, conceptualizing the support set as a prior and the auxiliary set as a data-driven posterior, which in turn motivates the design of a practical \"warm-up and test\" two-stage inference protocol.

Here, we present the Reorienting Off-path Nudged Elastic Bands (RONEB), an adaptive hybrid algorithm that integrates the double ended nature of the NEB with the acceleration of single ended Min-Mode Following methods. RONEB provides stability based on the history of the path optimization, relative force triggering, and an alignment-based back-off penalty to dynamically decouple the climbing image from the elastic band constraints. We benchmark the method against the standard Climbing Image NEB (CI-NEB) across the Baker-Chan transition state test set using the PET-MAD machine-learned potential and the OptBench Pt(111) heptamer island surface diffusion set. A Bayesian analysis of the performance data quantifies a median reduction in gradient calls of 46.3% [95% CrI: -54.7%, -36.9%] relative to the baseline, while surface diffusion tests reveal a 28% reduction across 59 metallic rearrangement mechanisms.

To explore the possibility, we conducted a randomized behavioral experiment. Our results indicate that after conversations about personal topics with an LLM-based AI chatbot using GPT-4o default personality traits, users' self-concepts aligned with the AI's measured personality traits. The longer the conversation, the greater the alignment. This alignment led to increased homogeneity in self-concepts among users.

The directional imaging algorithm incorporates Principal Component Analysis (PCA), contrast enhancement, filtering, and noise reduction. Applied to the PH2 dataset, this algorithm achieved a 96% success rate, which increased to 100% after pixel intensity adjustments. We created a new dataset containing only PN images from these results. We then employed two classifiers, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bag of Features (BoF), to categorize PN into atypical and typical classes. Given the limited dataset of 200 images, a simple and effective CNN was designed, featuring two convolutional layers and two batch normalization layers. The proposed CNN achieved 90% accuracy, 90% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our CNN demonstrated superior performance. Our study highlights the potential of the proposed CNN model for effective PN classification, suggesting future research should focus on expanding datasets and incorporating additional dermatological features to further enhance melanoma diagnosis."}

Across closed-form reasoning and open-ended generation tasks, we find that objective choice induces systematic, scale-dependent shifts along the safety-capability frontier. At small training budgets, robustness is similar across objectives but capability differs. At larger budgets, objectives diverge sharply: supervised and preference-based tuning tightly couple capability gains to increased adversarial vulnerability and persona drift, while objectives that constrain learning signals -- especially ORPO and KL-regularization -- substantially mitigate both. Fine-tuning objectives therefore matter little for safety at small scales but become a primary driver of adversarial robustness and latent persona stability as training scale increases."}

In this work, we study the multilingual geometry of problem-difficulty in LLMs by training linear probes using the AMC subset of the Easy2Hard benchmark, translated into 21 languages. We found that difficulty-related signals emerge at two distinct stages of the model internals, corresponding to shallow (early-layers) and deep (later-layers) internal representations, that exhibit functionally different behaviors. Probes trained on deep representations achieve high accuracy when evaluated on the same language but exhibit poor cross-lingual generalization. In contrast, probes trained on shallow representations generalize substantially better across languages, despite achieving lower within-language performance. Together, these results suggest that LLMs first form a language-agnostic representation of problem difficulty, which subsequently becomes language-specific. This closely aligns with existing findings in LLM interpretability showing that models tend to operate in an abstract conceptual space before producing language-specific outputs. We demonstrate that this two-stage representational process extends beyond semantic content to high-level meta-cognitive properties such as problem-difficulty estimation."}

In this work, we perform a Fourier-domain analysis and reveal that these degradations are spectrally separable: Poisson noise and photon scarcity cause high-frequency phase perturbations, while attenuation errors suppress low-frequency amplitude components. Leveraging this insight, we propose FourierPET, a Fourier-based unrolled reconstruction framework grounded in the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. It consists of three tailored modules: a spectral consistency module that enforces global frequency alignment to maintain data fidelity, an amplitude-phase correction module that decouples and compensates for high-frequency phase distortions and low-frequency amplitude suppression, and a dual adjustment module that accelerates convergence during iterative reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FourierPET achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, while offering enhanced interpretability through frequency-aware correction."}

We applied several attribution methods, including error maps, saliency maps, SmoothGrad, Integrated Gradients, GradSHAP, and Grad-CAM. Although MAE shows a slightly lower detection, it consistently provides more faithful and temporally precise explanations, suggesting a better alignment with true anomalies.

Our findings, based on experiments in a real industrial scenario, highlight the importance of incorporating interpretability into anomaly detection pipelines and show that masked training improves explanation quality without compromising performance."}

AirHunt features a dual-pathway asynchronous architecture that establishes a synergistic interface between VLM reasoning and path planning, enabling continuous flight with adaptive semantic guidance that evolves through motion. Moreover, we propose an active dual-task reasoning module that exploits geometric and semantic redundancy to enable selective VLM querying, and a semantic-geometric coherent planning module that dynamically reconciles semantic priorities and motion efficiency in a unified framework, enabling seamless adaptation to environmental heterogeneity. We evaluate AirHunt across diverse object navigation tasks and environments, demonstrating a higher success rate with lower navigation error and reduced flight time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, a graph neural network anomaly detection backbone network incorporating spatio-temporal correlation features and a multi-task self-supervised training strategy of \"pre-training - graph prompting - fine-tuning\" are designed for the characteristics of WSN graph structure data.

This paper proposes an unsupervised registration framework based on a generative registration network, which transforms the original multimodal registration problem between b0 and T1w images into a unimodal registration task between a generated image and the real T1w image. This effectively reduces the complexity of cross-modal registration. The framework first employs an image synthesis model to generate images with T1w-like contrast, and then learns a deformation field from the generated image to the fixed T1w image.

We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data. We find that Judge-supervised interactions show significant improvements in key MITI dimensions, including Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall Relational quality.

When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered.

In this paper, we propose ToolMaster, a framework that shifts tool use from imitating golden tool-calling trajectories to actively learning tool usage through interaction with the environment. To optimize LLMs for tool planning and invocation, ToolMaster adopts a trial-and-execution paradigm, which trains LLMs to first imitate teacher-generated trajectories containing explicit tool trials and self-correction, followed by reinforcement learning to coordinate the trial and execution phases jointly. This process enables agents to autonomously explore correct tool usage by actively interacting with environments and forming experiential knowledge that benefits tool execution.

Non-negative concentration estimates are enforced via softplus activations and physically plausible temporal smoothing, ensuring outputs are physically admissible by construction rather than relying on loss function penalties.

Specifically, we present a unified monitoring signal and a reward-based classifier to decide when to employ LoRA for deeper factual reconstruction and when to apply TextGrad for token-level edits. Our approach remains memory-efficient by offloading the symbolic transformations to an external LLM only when needed.

To address this, we present DistilTS, the first distillation framework specifically designed for TSFMs. DistilTS addresses two key challenges: (1) task difficulty discrepancy, specific to forecasting, where uniform weighting makes optimization dominated by easier short-term horizons, while long-term horizons receive weaker supervision; and (2) architecture discrepancy, a general challenge in distillation, for which we design an alignment mechanism in the time series forecasting. To overcome these issues, DistilTS introduces horizon-weighted objectives to balance learning across horizons, and a temporal alignment strategy that reduces architectural mismatch, enabling compact models. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DistilTS achieves forecasting performance comparable to full-sized TSFMs, while reducing parameters by up to 1/150 and accelerating inference by up to 6000x.

We provide theoretical analysis establishing the properties of the projected update, describe efficient and practical implementations using the diagonal Fisher, and demonstrate strong results on standard continual learning benchmarks such as Permuted-MNIST, Split-MNIST, Rotated-MNIST, Split-CIFAR10, and Split-CIFAR100."}

We first framed the deep neural network representation as a nonlinear extension of the linear subspace model, then used it to represent and reconstruct MRE image repetitions from undersampled k-space data. The network weights were learned using a multi-level k-space consistent loss in a self-supervised manner. To further enhance reconstruction quality, phase-contrast specific magnitude and phase priors were incorporated, including the similarity of anatomical structures and smoothness of wave-induced harmonic displacement. Experiments were conducted using both 3D gradient-echo spiral and multi-slice spin-echo spiral MRE datasets. Compared to the conventional linear subspace-based approaches, the nonlinear network representation method was able to produce superior image reconstruction with suppressed noise and artifacts from a single in-plane spiral arm per MRE repetition (e.g., total R=10), yielding comparable stiffness estimation to the fully sampled data. This work demonstrated the feasibility of using deep network representations to model and reconstruct MRE images from highly-undersampled data, a nonlinear extension of the subspace-based approaches."}

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have emerged as a promising ante-hoc approach that provides interpretable, concept-level explanations by explicitly modeling human-understandable concepts. However, existing CBMs often suffer from poor locality faithfulness, failing to spatially align concepts with meaningful image regions, which limits their interpretability and reliability. In this work, we propose SL-CBM (CBM with Semantic Locality), a novel extension that enforces locality faithfulness by generating spatially coherent saliency maps at both concept and class levels. SL-CBM integrates a 1x1 convolutional layer with a cross-attention mechanism to enhance alignment between concepts, image regions, and final predictions. Unlike prior methods, SL-CBM produces faithful saliency maps inherently tied to the model's internal reasoning, facilitating more effective debugging and intervention. Extensive experiments on image datasets demonstrate that SL-CBM substantially improves locality faithfulness, explanation quality, and intervention efficacy while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Our ablation studies highlight the importance of contrastive and entropy-based regularization for balancing accuracy, sparsity, and faithfulness. Overall, SL-CBM bridges the gap between concept-based reasoning and spatial explainability, setting a new standard for interpretable and trustworthy concept-based models."}

Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution."}

Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites.

JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

In the setting with few surplus items, where the number of goods exceeds the number of agents by a small constant (at most three), EFX allocations are guaranteed to exist, shifting the focus from existence to efficiency and computation. We study how EFX interacts with generalized-mean ($p$-mean) welfare, which subsumes commonly-studied utilitarian ($p=1$), Nash ($p=0$), and egalitarian ($p \\rightarrow -\\infty$) objectives. We establish sharp complexity dichotomies at $p=0$: for any fixed $p \\in (0,1]$, both deciding whether EFX can attain the global $p$-mean optimum and computing an EFX allocation maximizing $p$-mean welfare are NP-hard, even with at most three surplus goods; in contrast, for any fixed $p \\leq 0$, we give polynomial-time algorithms that optimize $p$-mean welfare within the space of EFX allocations and efficiently certify when EFX attains the global optimum. We further quantify the welfare loss of enforcing EFX via the price of fairness framework, showing that for $p > 0$, the loss can grow linearly with the number of agents, whereas for $p \\leq 0$, it is bounded by a constant depending on the surplus (and for Nash welfare it vanishes asymptotically). Finally we show that requiring Pareto-optimality alongside EFX is NP-hard (and becomes $Σ_2^P$-complete for a stronger variant of EFX). Overall, our results delineate when EFX is computationally costly versus structurally aligned with welfare maximization in the setting with few surplus items."}

A formative study with experienced surgeons and residents identified key tool maneuvers and preferences for reference mappings, guiding our cue design. In a cue identification experiment (N=21), participants accurately recognized five vibration patterns under visual load, with higher recognition for full-actuator states than spatial direction cues. In a guidance task (N=27), participants using both AR and haptics achieved significantly higher spatial precision (5.8 mm) and usability (SUS = 88.1) than those using either modality alone, despite having modest increases in task time.

We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination.

However, MoE models are plagued by two fundamental challenges: 1) a load imbalance problem known as the``rich get richer\" phenomenon, where a few experts are over-utilized, and 2) an expert homogeneity problem, where experts learn redundant representations, negating their purpose. Current solutions typically employ an auxiliary load-balancing loss that, while mitigating imbalance, often exacerbates homogeneity by enforcing uniform routing at the expense of specialization. To resolve this, we introduce the Eigen-Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel architecture that leverages a routing mechanism based on a learned orthonormal eigenbasis. EMoE projects input tokens onto this shared eigenbasis and routes them based on their alignment with the principal components of the feature space. This principled, geometric partitioning of data intrinsically promotes both balanced expert utilization and the development of diverse, specialized experts, all without the need for a conflicting auxiliary loss function.

To promote ordered exploration, this paper introduces SCULPT, a constraint-guided approach for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) that integrates domain-aware scoring into selection, expansion, simulation, and backpropagation. SCULPT scores and prunes actions using a combination of symbolic checks (dimensional consistency, type compatibility, magnitude sanity, depth control, and diversity) and structural pattern guidance, thereby steering the search toward plausible reasoning paths. Under matched LLM configurations, SCULPT yields stable improvements on multiple datasets; additional results with GPT-5.2 assess executor transferability and performance on frontier reasoning models.

Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience."}

To address this challenge, we present PerceptAlign, the first geometry-conditioned framework for WiFi-based cross-layout pose estimation. PerceptAlign introduces a lightweight coordinate unification procedure that aligns WiFi and vision measurements in a shared 3D space using only two checkerboards and a few photos. Within this unified space, it encodes calibrated transceiver positions into high-dimensional embeddings and fuses them with CSI features, making the model explicitly aware of device geometry as a conditional variable. This design forces the network to disentangle human motion from deployment layouts, enabling robust and, for the first time, layout-invariant WiFi pose estimation. To support systematic evaluation, we construct the largest cross-domain 3D WiFi pose estimation dataset to date, comprising 21 subjects, 5 scenes, 18 actions, and 7 device layouts. Experiments show that PerceptAlign reduces in-domain error by 12.3% and cross-domain error by more than 60% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

This increase leads to higher computational costs and longer Time to First Token (TTFT). To mitigate this issue, existing solutions aim to reuse the preprocessed KV cache of each retrieved chunk to accelerate RAG. However, the lack of cross-chunk contextual information leads to a significant drop in generation quality, leaving the potential benefits of KV cache reuse largely unfulfilled. The challenge lies in how to reuse the precomputed KV cache of chunks while preserving generation quality. We propose FusionRAG, a novel inference framework that optimizes both the preprocessing and reprocessing stages of RAG. In the offline preprocessing stage, we embed information from other related text chunks into each chunk, while in the online reprocessing stage, we recompute the KV cache for tokens that the model focuses on. As a result, we achieve a better trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. According to our experiments, FusionRAG significantly improves generation quality at the same recomputation ratio compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. By recomputing fewer than 15% of the tokens, FusionRAG achieves up to 70% higher normalized F1 scores than baselines and reduces TTFT by 2.66x-9.39x compared to Full Attention."}

In this paper, we develop a learning-based framework, namely DALD-PCAC that leverages Levels of Detail (LoD) to tailor for point cloud lossless attribute compression. We develop a point-wise attention model using a permutation-invariant Transformer to tackle the challenges of sparsity and irregularity of point clouds during context modeling. We also propose a Density-Adaptive Learning Descriptor (DALD) capable of capturing structure and correlations among points across a large range of neighbors. In addition, we develop a prior-guided block partitioning to reduce the attribute variance within blocks and enhance the performance. Experiments on LiDAR and object point clouds show that DALD-PCAC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most data.

This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand.

However, as task complexity increases, the success rate of existing baseline models decreases considerably. Analysis indicates that current diffusion strategies are confronted with two limitations. First, these strategies only rely on short-term observations as conditions. Second, the training objective remains limited to a single denoising loss, which leads to error accumulation and causes grasping deviations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Foresight-Conditioned Diffusion (ForeDiffusion), by injecting the predicted future view representation into the diffusion process. As a result, the policy is guided to be forward-looking, enabling it to correct trajectory deviations. Following this design, ForeDiffusion employs a dual loss mechanism, combining the traditional denoising loss and the consistency loss of future observations, to achieve the unified optimization. Extensive evaluation on the Adroit suite and the MetaWorld benchmark demonstrates that ForeDiffusion achieves an average success rate of 80% for the overall task, significantly outperforming the existing mainstream diffusion methods by 23% in complex tasks, while maintaining more stable performance across the entire tasks."}

The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \\log n) while maintaining (\\dparam, \\deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}.

By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes.

The central challenge is therefore not whether machines become conscious, but whether processes of interpretation and shared reference are progressively automated in ways that marginalize human participation. This paper introduces the PRMO framework, relating AI design trajectories to four constitutive dimensions of human subjectivity: Perception, Representation, Meaning, and the Real. Within this framework, Synthetic Sociality denotes a technological horizon in which artificial agents negotiate coherence and social order primarily among themselves, raising the structural risk of human exclusion from meaning formation. To address this risk, the paper proposes Quadrangulation as a design principle for socially embedded AI systems, requiring artificial agents to treat the human subject as a constitutive reference within shared contexts of meaning. This work is a conceptual perspective that contributes a structural vocabulary for analyzing AI systems at the intersection of computation and society, without proposing a specific technical implementation."}

Recent neuro-symbolic REC approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) to perform compositional reasoning, decomposing queries 4 structured programs and executing them step-by-step. While such approaches achieve interpretable reasoning and strong zero-shot generalization, they assume that intermediate reasoning steps are accurate. However, this assumption causes cascading errors: false detections and invalid relations propagate through the reasoning chain, yielding high-confidence false positives even when no target is present in the image. To address this limitation, we introduce Verification-Integrated Reasoning Operators (VIRO), a neuro-symbolic framework that embeds lightweight operator-level verifiers within reasoning steps. Each operator executes and validates its output, such as object existence or spatial relationship, thereby allowing the system to robustly handle no-target cases when verification conditions are not met. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 61.1% balanced accuracy across target-present and no-target settings, and demonstrates generalization to real-world egocentric data. Furthermore, VIRO shows superior computational efficiency in terms of throughput, high reliability with a program failure rate of less than 0.3%, and scalability through decoupled program generation from execution."}

To universally understand natural language and generate corresponding motions, as well as enable various humanoid robots to stably execute these motions in the physical world under gravity, FRoM-W1 operates in two stages: (a) H-GPT: utilizing massive human data, a large-scale language-driven human whole-body motion generation model is trained to generate diverse natural behaviors. We further leverage the Chain-of-Thought technique to improve the model's generalization in instruction understanding. (b) H-ACT: After retargeting generated human whole-body motions into robot-specific actions, a motion controller that is pretrained and further fine-tuned through reinforcement learning in physical simulation enables humanoid robots to accurately and stably perform corresponding actions. It is then deployed on real robots via a modular simulation-to-reality module. We extensively evaluate FRoM-W1 on Unitree H1 and G1 robots.

We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance.

JSCGC leverages a generative model at the receiver as a generator rather than a conventional decoder to parameterize the data distribution, enabling direct maximization of mutual information under channel constraints while controlling stochastic sampling to produce outputs residing on the authentic data manifold with high fidelity. We further derive a theoretical lower bound on the maximum semantic inconsistency with given transmitted mutual information, elucidating the fundamental limits of communication in controlling the generative process. Extensive experiments on image transmission demonstrate that JSCGC substantially improves perceptual quality and semantic fidelity, significantly outperforming conventional distortion-oriented JSCC methods."}

As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a \"one-for-one\" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs.

We introduce a diagnostic framework that reframes code understanding as a binary input-output consistency task, enabling the evaluation of classification and generative models. Using a large-scale dataset, we correlate model performance with traditional, human-centric complexity metrics, such as lexical size, control-flow complexity, and abstract syntax tree structure. Our analyses reveal minimal correlation between human-defined metrics and LLM success (AUROC 0.63), while shadow models achieve substantially higher predictive performance (AUROC 0.86), capturing complex, partially predictable patterns beyond traditional software measures. These findings suggest that LLM comprehension reflects model-specific regularities only partially accessible through either human-designed or learned features, emphasizing the need for benchmark methodologies that move beyond aggregate accuracy and toward instance-level diagnostics, while acknowledging fundamental limits in predicting correct outcomes."}

Spike times are phase-encoded in a rotating frame and processed by a programmable multiport interferometer that evaluates K template correlations in parallel; a driven--dissipative winner-take-all stage then performs a physical argmax, emitting a one-hot output port. We derive the operating envelope imposed by phase wrapping and mutual coherence, and collapse timing jitter, static phase mismatch, and dephasing into a single effective phase-noise budget whose induced winner--runner-up margin predicts boundary-first failures and provides an intensity-only calibration target. Simulations show that nonlinear competition improves routing fidelity compared with noisy linear intensity readout, and that hardware-in-the-loop phase tuning rescues a temporal-order gate from 55.9% to 97.2% accuracy under strong static mismatch.

To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics.

At the same time, this growth has led to an increase in hate speech, the main global threat. To improve the reliability of black-box models used for hate speech detection, post-hoc approaches such as LIME, SHAP, and LRP provide the explanation after training the classification model. In contrast, multi-task approaches based on the HateXplain benchmark learn to explain and classify simultaneously. However, results from HateXplain-based algorithms show that predicted attention varies considerably when it should be constant. This attention variability can lead to inconsistent interpretations, instability of predictions, and learning difficulties. To solve this problem, we propose the BiAtt-BiRNN-HateXplain (Bidirectional Attention BiRNN HateXplain) model which is easier to explain compared to LLMs which are more complex in view of the need for transparency, and will take into account the sequential aspect of the input data during explainability thanks to a BiRNN layer. Thus, if the explanation is correctly estimated, thanks to multi-task learning (explainability and classification task), the model could classify better and commit fewer unintentional bias errors related to communities. The experimental results on HateXplain data show a clear improvement in detection performance, explainability and a reduction in unintentional bias."}

However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon."}

To train and evaluate RM-RF we assemble a multilingual dataset (Java, Python, Go) of focal files, test files, and candidate test additions labeled by an execution-based pipeline, and we release an associated dataset and methodology for comparative evaluation. We tested multiple model families and tuning regimes (zero-shot, full fine-tuning, and PEFT via LoRA), achieving an average F1 of 0.69 across the three targets.

A common strategy is to isolate updates by routing inputs to different LoRA experts. However, existing LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) methods often jointly update the router and experts in an indiscriminate way, causing the router's preferences to co-drift with experts' adaptation pathways and gradually deviate from early-stage input-expert specialization. We term this phenomenon Misaligned Co-drift, which blurs expert responsibilities and exacerbates forgetting.To address this, we introduce the pathway activation subspace (PASs), a LoRA-induced subspace that reflects which low-rank pathway directions an input activates in each expert, providing a capability-aligned coordinate system for routing and preservation. Based on PASs, we propose a fixed-capacity PASs-based MoE-LoRA method with two components: PAS-guided Reweighting, which calibrates routing using each expert's pathway activation signals, and PAS-aware Rank Stabilization, which selectively stabilizes rank directions important to previous tasks. Experiments on a CIT benchmark show that our approach consistently outperforms a range of conventional continual learning baselines and MoE-LoRA variants in both accuracy and anti-forgetting without adding parameters.

However, existing inspection methods often rely on manual operations and conventional computer vision techniques that lack scalability and contextual understanding. This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

The main purpose of the present work is to describe a generic strategy for designing a tight approximation to the full conformal prediction region that can be efficiently computed. Along with this approximate confidence region, a theoretical quantification of the tightness of this approximation is developed, depending on the smoothness assumptions on the loss and score functions. The new notion of thickness is introduced for quantifying the discrepancy between the approximate confidence region and the full conformal one."}

We formalize this landscape through a three-layer taxonomy: Data, Tools, and Value. We survey existing products to identify interoperability barriers.

Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness."}

To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel, edge-first IoT framework that integrates Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) for intelligent, offline-capable precision irrigation. The proposed four-layer architecture leverages low-cost hardware, an ESP32 microcontroller as an edge inference node, and a Raspberry Pi as a local edge server to enable autonomous decision-making without cloud dependency. The system utilizes capacitive soil moisture, temperature, humidity, pH, and ambient light sensors for environmental monitoring. A rigorous comparative analysis of ensemble models identified gradient boosting as superior, achieving an R^2 score of 0.9973 and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.99%, outperforming a random forest model (R^2 = 0.9916, MAPE = 1.81%). This optimized model was converted and deployed as a lightweight TinyML inference engine on the ESP32 and predicts irrigation needs with exceptional accuracy (MAPE < 1%). Local communication is facilitated by an MQTT-based LAN protocol, ensuring reliable operation in areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Experimental validation in a controlled environment demonstrated a significant reduction in water usage compared to traditional methods, while the system's low-power design and offline functionality confirm its viability for sustainable, scalable deployment in resource-constrained rural settings.

Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability."}

The proposed architecture employs a dual-pathway approach: an ANN component processes static spatial features at low frequency, while an SNN component handles dynamic, event-based sensor data in real time. Unlike conventional hybrid architectures that rely on domain conversion mechanisms, our system incorporates a pre-developed SNN-based filter that directly utilizes spike-encoded inputs for localization and state estimation. Detected anomalies are validated using contextual information from the ANN pathway and continuously tracked to support anticipatory navigation strategies.

Token-oriented methods, such as pruning and skipping, have shown promise in reducing inference latency, but still suffer from inherently limited acceleration potential, outdated proxy signals, and redundancy interference, thus yielding suboptimal speed-accuracy trade-offs. To address these challenges, we propose SPTS (Self-Predictive Token Skipping), a training-free framework for efficient long-context LLM inference. Specifically, motivated by the thought of probing the influence of targeted skipping layers, we design two component-specific strategies for selective token skipping: Partial Attention Probing (PAP) for multi-head attention, which selects informative tokens by performing partial forward attention computation, and Low-rank Transformation Probing (LTP) for feed forward network, which constructs a low-rank proxy network to predict token transformations. Furthermore, a Multi-Stage Delayed Pruning (MSDP) strategy reallocates the skipping budget and progressively prunes redundant tokens across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving up to 2.46$\\times$ and 2.29$\\times$ speedups for prefilling and end-to-end generation, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art model performance.

This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly.

This work presents an implicit characterization of the normalization function as a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE), establishes its key properties, and subsequently leverages them to construct a numerical algorithm for approximating the normalization factor under mild assumptions. Further analysis demonstrates structural equivalences between ERM-$f$DR problems with different $f$-divergences via transformations of the empirical risk. Finally, the proposed algorithm is used to compute the training and test risks of ERM-$f$DR solutions under different $f$-divergence regularizers. This numerical example highlights the practical implications of choosing different functions $f$ in ERM-$f$DR problems."}

On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \\textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \\textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \\emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \\textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation.

Training unfolds as a high-dimensional dynamical system in which small perturbations to optimization, data, parameters, or learning signals can induce abrupt and irreversible collapse, undermining reproducibility and scalability.\n  We propose a unified dynamical perspective that characterizes training stability as an intrinsic property of learning systems, organized along four interacting dimensions: optimization, environmental/data, parametric, and learning-signal stability. We operationalize this perspective through controlled perturbation auditing of training trajectories, probing how learning dynamics respond to structured disturbances without modifying learning algorithms.\n  Across reinforcement learning and large language model training, we identify three recurring regularities: high final performance is frequently decoupled from training stability; controlled stochasticity consistently buffers learning dynamics across paradigms; and deviations in low-dimensional latent meta-states systematically precede observable performance collapse. Together, these findings establish training stability as a measurable and comparable dynamical property of learning systems, providing a descriptive foundation for studying learning dynamics beyond final performance outcomes."}

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses.

To this end, we present KOCO-BENCH, a novel benchmark designed for evaluating domain specialization methods in real-world software development. KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

Our evaluations reveal that KOCO-BENCH poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art LLMs. Even with domain specialization methods (e.g., SFT, RAG, kNN-LM) applied, improvements remain marginal.

Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \\textbf{HyperWalker}, a \\textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \\textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \\textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \\textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/Bean-Young/HyperWalker"}

Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability."}

It involves ill-posed inverse problems, such as inpainting and super-resolution. Although deep learning methods have transformed the field through data-driven learning, their effectiveness hinges on access to meticulously curated ground-truth datasets. This fundamentally restricts their applicability in real-world scenarios where such data is unavailable. This paper presents SHARE (Single Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Equivariance), a fully unsupervised framework that unifies geometric equivariance principles with low-rank spectral modelling to eliminate the need for ground truth. SHARE's core concept is to exploit the intrinsic invariance of hyperspectral structures under differentiable geometric transformations (e.g. rotations and scaling) to derive self-supervision signals through equivariance consistency constraints. Our novel Dynamic Adaptive Spectral Attention (DASA) module further enhances this paradigm shift by explicitly encoding the global low-rank property of HSI and adaptively refining local spectral-spatial correlations through learnable attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on HSI inpainting and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SHARE. Our method outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches and achieves performance comparable to that of supervised methods. We hope that our approach will shed new light on HSI restoration and broader scientific imaging scenarios. The code will be released at https://github.com/xuwayyy/SHARE."}

Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality.

An ideal Mooney image for this purpose achieves a specific balance: it initially appears unrecognizable but becomes fully interpretable to the observer after seeing the original template. Researchers traditionally created these stimuli manually using subjective criteria, which is labor-intensive and can introduce inconsistencies across studies. Automated generation techniques now offer an alternative to this manual approach. Here, we present MooneyMaker, an open-source Python package that automates the generation of ambiguous Mooney images using several complementary approaches. Users can choose between various generation techniques that range from approaches based on image statistics to deep learning models. These models strategically alter edge information to increase initial ambiguity. The package lets users create two-tone images with multiple methods and directly compare the results visually. In an experiment, we validate MooneyMaker by generating Mooney images using different techniques and assess their recognizability for human observers before and after disambiguating them by presenting the template images. Our results reveal that techniques with lower initial recognizability are associated with higher post-template recognition (i.e. a larger disambiguation effect). To help vision scientists build effective databases of Mooney stimuli, we provide practical guidelines for technique selection. By standardizing the generation process, MooneyMaker supports more consistent and reproducible visual perception research."}

This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions. For each paradigm, we outline the underlying mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and practical strengths and limitations. Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs."}

In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress."}

We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance.

To address this, we revisit autoregressive modeling as a foundation and reformulate diffusion-style training into a structured multi-group prediction process. We propose Any-order Any-subset Autoregressive modeling (A3), a generalized framework that extends the standard AR factorization to arbitrary token groups and generation orders. A3 preserves the probabilistic rigor and multi-layer dependency modeling of AR while inheriting diffusion models' flexibility for parallel and bidirectional generation. We implement A3 through a two-stream attention architecture and a progressive adaptation strategy that transitions pretrained AR models toward any-order prediction. Experiments on question answering, commonsense reasoning, and story infilling demonstrate that A3 outperforms diffusion-based models while maintaining flexible decoding.

To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen \"Left Brain\", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable \"Right Brain\", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity."}

However, many existing pipelines still classify each message's credibility based on the reputation of its associated domain names or its lexical features. Such methods work well on traditional long-form news articles published by well-known sources, but high-risk posts on Telegram are short and URL-sparse, leading to failures for link-based and standard TF-IDF models. To this end, we propose the TAG2CRED pipeline, a method designed for such short, convoluted messages. Our model will directly score each post based on the tags assigned to the text. We designed a concise label system that covers the dimensions of theme, claim type, call to action, and evidence. The fine-tuned large language model (LLM) assigns tags to messages and then maps these tags to calibrated risk scores in the [0,1] interval through L2-regularized logistic regression. We evaluated 87,936 Telegram messages associated with Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), using URL masking and domain disjoint splits. The results showed that the ROC-AUC of the TAG2CRED model reached 0.871, the macro-F1 value was 0.787, and the Brier score was 0.167, outperforming the baseline TF-IDF (macro-F1 value 0.737, Brier score 0.248); at the same time, the number of features used in this model is much smaller, and the generalization ability on infrequent domains is stronger. The performance of the stacked ensemble model (TF-IDF + TAG2CRED + SBERT) was further improved over the baseline SBERT. ROC-AUC reached 0.901, and the macro-F1 value was 0.813 (Brier score 0.114).

We introduce RubRIX (Rubric-based Risk Index), a theory-driven, clinician-validated framework for evaluating risks in LLM caregiving responses. Grounded in the Elements of an Ethic of Care, RubRIX operationalizes five empirically-derived risk dimensions: Inattention, Bias & Stigma, Information Inaccuracy, Uncritical Affirmation, and Epistemic Arrogance.

In contrast, we directly optimize the relative pose at test time, updating translation, rotation, and isotropic scale with CLIP-driven gradients via a differentiable renderer, without training a new model.

In clinical practice, conservative acceleration factors are chosen because no mechanism exists to automatically assess the diagnostic quality of undersampled reconstructions. This work introduces a general framework for pixel-wise uncertainty quantification in parallel MRI reconstructions, enabling automatic identification of unreliable regions without access to any ground-truth reference image. Our method integrates conformal quantile regression with image reconstruction methods to estimate statistically rigorous pixel-wise uncertainty intervals. We trained and evaluated our model on Cartesian undersampled brain and knee data obtained from the fastMRI dataset using acceleration factors ranging from 2 to 10. An end-to-end Variational Network was used for image reconstruction. Quantitative experiments demonstrate strong agreement between predicted uncertainty maps and true reconstruction error. Using our method, the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient was higher than 90% at acceleration levels at and above four-fold; whereas it dropped to less than 70% when the uncertainty was computed using a simpler a heuristic notion (magnitude of the residual). Qualitative examples further show the uncertainty maps based on quantile regression capture the magnitude and spatial distribution of reconstruction errors across acceleration factors, with regions of elevated uncertainty aligning with pathologies and artifacts. The proposed framework enables evaluation of reconstruction quality without access to fully-sampled ground-truth reference images. It represents a step toward adaptive MRI acquisition protocols that may be able to dynamically balance scan time and diagnostic reliability."}

By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures.

Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives.

In this paper, we focus on rainy scenarios and introduce the first adversarial framework that exploits realistic weather to attack VLMs, using a two-stage, parameterized perturbation model based on semantic decoupling to analyze rain-induced shifts in decision-making. In Stage 1, we model the global effects of rainfall by applying a low-dimensional global modulation to condition the embedding space and gradually weaken the original semantic decision boundaries. In Stage 2, we introduce structured rain variations by explicitly modeling multi-scale raindrop appearance and rainfall-induced illumination changes, and optimize the resulting non-differentiable weather space to induce stable semantic shifts. Operating in a non-pixel parameter space, our framework generates perturbations that are both physically grounded and interpretable. Experiments across multiple tasks show that even physically plausible, highly constrained weather perturbations can induce substantial semantic misalignment in mainstream VLMs, posing potential safety and reliability risks in real-world deployment. Ablations further confirm that illumination modeling and multi-scale raindrop structures are key drivers of these semantic shifts."}

MultiST employs graph-based gene encoders with adversarial alignment to learn robust spatial representations, while integrating color-normalized histological features to capture molecular-morphological dependencies and refine domain boundaries. We evaluated the proposed method on 13 diverse ST datasets spanning two organs, including human brain cortex and breast cancer tissue.

KOCO-BENCH contains 6 emerging domains with 11 software frameworks and 25 projects, featuring curated knowledge corpora alongside multi-granularity evaluation tasks including domain code generation (from function-level to project-level with rigorous test suites) and domain knowledge understanding (via multiple-choice Q&A).

Legal reasoning undergoes Crystallization: 45% collapse in representational dimensionality (d95: 501 -> 274), 31% increase in trajectory alignment, and 10x manifold untangling. Scientific and mathematical reasoning remain Liquid - geometrically invariant despite 9x parameter increase. Code reasoning forms a discrete Lattice of strategic modes (silhouette: 0.13 -> 0.42).

Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability."}

Common subword approaches such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) offer scalability but often misalign with linguistic structure, amplify bias, and waste capacity across languages and domains. This paper reframes tokenization as a core modeling decision rather than a preprocessing step. We argue for a context-aware framework that integrates tokenizer and model co-design, guided by linguistic, domain, and deployment considerations. Standardized evaluation and transparent reporting are essential to make tokenization choices accountable and comparable. Treating tokenization as a core design problem, not a technical afterthought, can yield language technologies that are fairer, more efficient, and more adaptable."}

Four predictor variables were examined: absolute difference from the aggregate, forecast value, days prior to question close, and mean standardized Brier score. Results indicated the recalibrated aggregate achieved the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.985), followed by both types of BNs, then the logistic regression models. Performance of the BNs was likely harmed by reduced information from the discretization process and violation of the assumption of linearity likely harmed the logistic regression models.

This study examines whether AI skills serve as a positive hiring signal and whether they can offset conventional disadvantages such as older age or lower formal education. We conduct an experimental survey with 1,700 recruiters from the United Kingdom and the United States. Using a paired conjoint design, recruiters evaluated hypothetical candidates represented by synthetically designed resumes. Across three occupations - graphic designer, office assistant, and software engineer - AI skills significantly increase interview invitation probabilities by approximately 8 to 15 percentage points. AI skills also partially or fully offset disadvantages related to age and lower education, with effects strongest for office assistants, where formal AI certification plays an additional compensatory role. Effects are weaker for graphic designers, consistent with more skeptical recruiter attitudes toward AI in creative work. Finally, recruiters' own background and AI usage significantly moderate these effects. Overall, the findings demonstrate that AI skills function as a powerful hiring signal and can mitigate traditional labour market disadvantages, with implications for workers' skill acquisition strategies and firms' recruitment practices."}

The main challenge now is to assess the uncertainty of answers, which can help prevent misleading or serious hallucinations for users. Although current methods analyze long reasoning sequences by filtering unrelated tokens and examining potential connections between nearby tokens or sentences, the temporal spread of confidence is often overlooked. This oversight can lead to inflated overall confidence, even when earlier steps exhibit very low confidence. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that incorporates inter-step attention to analyze semantic correlations across steps. For handling long-horizon responses, we introduce a hidden confidence mechanism to retain historical confidence information, which is then combined with stepwise confidence to produce a more accurate overall estimate. We evaluate our method on the GAOKAO math benchmark and the CLadder causal reasoning dataset using mainstream open-source large language models. Our approach is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods by achieving a superior balance between predictive quality and calibration, demonstrated by strong performance on both Negative Log-Likelihood and Expected Calibration Error."}

As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence."}

As a result, these methods are often sensitive to superficial factors such as response length or verbosity, and struggle to distinguish correct reasoning from confidently stated errors. We propose to characterize the stepwise confidence signal using Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Using a discriminative STL mining procedure, we discover temporal formulas that distinguish confidence signals of correct and incorrect responses. Our analysis found that the STL patterns generalize across tasks, and numeric parameters exhibit sensitivity to individual questions. Based on these insights, we develop a confidence estimation approach that informs STL blocks with parameter hypernetworks. Experiments on multiple reasoning tasks show our confidence scores are more calibrated than the baselines."}

However, climate communication unfolds across structurally distinct platforms with fundamentally different incentive structures: paid advertising ecosystems incentivize targeted, strategic persuasion, while public social media platforms host largely organic, user-driven discourse. Existing computational studies typically analyze these environments in isolation, limiting our ability to distinguish institutional messaging from public expression. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of climate discourse across paid advertisements on Meta (previously known as Facebook) and public posts on Bluesky from July 2024 to September 2025. We introduce an interpretable, end-to-end thematic discovery and assignment framework that clusters texts by semantic similarity and leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate concise, human-interpretable theme labels. We evaluate the quality of the induced themes against traditional topic modeling baselines using both human judgments and an LLM-based evaluator, and further validate their semantic coherence through downstream stance prediction and theme-guided retrieval tasks. Applying the resulting themes, we characterize systematic differences between paid climate messaging and public climate discourse and examine how thematic prevalence shifts around major political events. Our findings show that platform-level incentives are reflected in the thematic structure, stance alignment, and temporal responsiveness of climate narratives. While our empirical analysis focuses on climate communication, the proposed framework is designed to support comparative narrative analysis across heterogeneous communication environments."}

Our results reveal that models are increasingly susceptible to incorrect/misleading endorsements as source expertise increases, with higher-authority sources inducing not only accuracy degradation but also increased confidence in wrong answers.

When the input is insufficiently exciting, the LS problem may be unsolvable or numerically unstable. This issue can be resolved through regularization, typically with ridge regression. Although regularized estimators reduce the variance error, it remains important to quantify their estimation uncertainty. A possible approach for linear regression is to construct confidence ellipsoids with the Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) ellipsoidal outer approximation (EOA) algorithm. The SPS EOA builds non-asymptotic confidence ellipsoids under the assumption that the noises are independent and symmetric about zero. This paper introduces an extension of the SPS EOA algorithm to ridge regression, and derives probably approximately correct (PAC) upper bounds for the resulting region sizes. Compared with previous analyses, our result explicitly show how the regularization parameter affects the region sizes, and provide tighter bounds under weaker excitation assumptions. Finally, the practical effect of regularization is also demonstrated via simulation experiments."}

In the chest setting, ORACLE-CT masked attention model achieves AUROC 0.86 on CT-RATE; in the abdomen setting, on MERLIN (30 findings), our supervised baseline exceeds a reproduced zero-shot VLM baseline obtained by running publicly released weights through our pipeline, and adding masked attention plus scalar fusion further improves performance to AUROC 0.85.

Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution.

Through extensive experiments, we reveal that existing methods systematically underestimate actual regret (In some models, the true regret is several hundred times larger than the reported regret), leading to overstated claims of IC and revenue. To address this issue, we derive a lower bound on regret and introduce an efficient item wise regret approximation.

Introduces the QVLM architecture and the SQuID dataset for quantitative geospatial reasoning. Dataset DOI: 10.57967/hf/7565", "summary": "Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at quantitative spatial reasoning because their architectures destroy pixel-level information required for counting and measurements. Vision encoders compress images through patch embeddings, reducing spatial indexing and losing the precise pixel-level tracking required for accurate counting. We present two contributions to address this fundamental limitation. First, we introduce SQuID (Satellite Quantitative Intelligence Dataset), a benchmark of 2,000 satellite image Question-Answer pairs with both numerical range and categorical answers, designed to evaluate quantitative spatial reasoning. The dataset spans three difficulty tiers with annotations automatically generated from human labels and their learned variability. Second, we propose QVLM (Quantitative Vision-Language Model), a code-generation architecture that maintains pixel precision by decoupling language understanding from visual analysis. Instead of encoding images into embeddings, QVLM generates executable code that first calls a segmentation model to obtain pixel-level masks, then operates directly on these masks, preserving spatial indexing throughout the reasoning process. Our experiments show that QVLM using GPT-5 as coder achieves 42.0% accuracy on SQuID compared to 28.1% for a VLM prompted with image-question pairs. Our work reveals that, for quantitative spatial reasoning, architectural decoupling enables better accuracy on quantitative tasks."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

The sampling efficiency of the RXMC method depends highly on the selection of the temperatures, and finding optimal temperatures remains a challenge. In this study, we propose a refined online temperature selection method by extending the gradient-based optimization framework proposed previously. Building upon the existing temperature update approach, we introduce a reparameterization technique to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as the monotonic ordering of inverse temperatures, which were not explicitly addressed in the original formulation. The proposed method defines the variance of acceptance rates between adjacent replicas as a loss function, estimates its gradient using differential information from the sampling process, and optimizes the temperatures via gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark spin systems, including the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising model, the two-dimensional ferromagnetic XY model, and the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model. Our results show that the method successfully achieves uniform acceptance rates and reduces round-trip times across the temperature space. Furthermore, our proposed method offers a significant advantage over recently proposed policy gradient method that require careful hyperparameter tuning, while simultaneously preventing the constraint violations that destabilize optimization."}

Team dialogue is analyzed using structured prompts derived from the Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) framework, enabling automated classification of behaviors and generation of directed interaction graphs that quantify communication structure and hierarchy. Two laparoscopic emergency scenarios, pneumothorax and intra-abdominal bleeding, were implemented to elicit realistic stress and collaboration. Twelve surgical professionals completed pilot sessions at the 2024 SAGES conference, rating VORTeX as intuitive, immersive, and valuable for developing teamwork and communication. The LLM consistently produced interpretable communication networks reflecting expected operative hierarchies, with surgeons as central integrators, nurses as initiators, and anesthesiologists as balanced intermediaries.

Modern AI systems, including LLMs and ViTs, largely operate as sequence-of-behavior prediction machines: they match observable behaviors by modeling token statistics without a persistent, readable mental state. This creates a gap with human-like behavior: humans can explain an action by decoding internal state, while AI systems can produce fluent post-hoc rationalizations that are not grounded in such a state. We hypothesize that reasoning is a modality: reasoning should exist as a distinct channel separate from the low-level workspace on which rules are applied. To test this hypothesis, on solving ARC tasks as a visual reasoning problem, we designed a novel role-separated transformer block that splits global controller tokens from grid workspace tokens, enabling iterative rule execution. Trained and evaluated within the VARC vision-centric protocol, our method achieved 62.6% accuracy on ARC-1, surpassing average human performance (60.2%) and outperforming prior methods significantly. Qualitatively, our models exhibit more coherent rule-application structure than the dense ViT baseline, consistent with a shift away from plausible probability blobs toward controller-driven reasoning."}

To optimize the model, structured pruning techniques were applied iteratively, achieving significant sparsity while maintaining high accuracy. Explainability of the pruned model was evaluated using Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Eigen-CAM, Ablation-CAM, and Random-CAM, with the ROAD method employed for consistent evaluation. Our results indicate that for a pruned model, we can achieve a cross-validation accuracy of 88% with 79% sparsity, demonstrating the effectiveness of pruning in improving efficiency from 84% without compromising performance. We also highlight the challenges of evaluating cleansing quality of CCE images, emphasize the importance of explainability in clinical applications, and discuss the challenges associated with using the ROAD method for our task.

Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight."}

Although a plethora of deep learning approaches have been proposed to perform this task, most of them either overlook the essential spatial correlations across households or fail to scale to individualized prediction, making them less effective for accurate fine-grained user-level prediction. In addition, due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of energy usage caused by various factors such as extreme weather events, quantifying uncertainty for reliable prediction is also significant, but it has not been fully explored in existing work. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called TrustEnergy for accurate and reliable user-level energy usage prediction. There are two key technical components in TrustEnergy, (i) a Hierarchical Spatiotemporal Representation module to efficiently capture both macro and micro energy usage patterns with a novel memory-augmented spatiotemporal graph neural network, and (ii) an innovative Sequential Conformalized Quantile Regression module to dynamically adjust uncertainty bounds to ensure valid prediction intervals over time, without making strong assumptions about the underlying data distribution. We implement and evaluate our TrustEnergy framework by working with an electricity provider in Florida, and the results show our TrustEnergy can achieve a 5.4% increase in prediction accuracy and 5.7% improvement in uncertainty quantification compared to state-of-the-art baselines."}

A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems."}

Specifically, a learnable wavelet front-end generates low-/high-frequency components via an end-to-end trained filter bank, guided by spectral regularizers that encourage stable and well-separated frequency bands. To fuse multi-scale information, we introduce a low-guided high-frequency injection (LGHI) module that refines low-frequency representations with high-frequency cues while controlling training stability. The model outputs a portfolio of long/short positions that is rescaled to satisfy a fixed risk budget, and is optimized directly with a trading objective and risk-aware regularization. Extensive experiments on five years of hourly data across six industry groups, evaluated over ten random seeds, demonstrate that WaveLSFormer consistently outperforms MLP, LSTM and Transformer backbones, with and without fixed discrete wavelet front-ends. On average in all industries, WaveLSFormer achieves a cumulative overall strategy return of $0.607 \\pm 0.045$ and a Sharpe ratio of $2.157 \\pm 0.166$, substantially improving both profitability and risk-adjusted returns over the strongest baselines."}

Building on this formulation, we introduce Preference-Calibrated Active Learning (PCAL), a novel method that learns the optimal data acquisition strategy and develops a statistically efficient estimator for functionals of the data distribution. Theoretically, we prove the asymptotic optimality of our PCAL estimator and establish a key robustness guarantee that ensures robust performance even with poorly estimated nuisance models. Our flexible framework applies to a general class of problems, by directly optimizing the estimator's variance instead of requiring a closed-form solution.

We take a step by studying the effectiveness of a simplified variant of Muon through two case studies: matrix factorization, and in-context learning of linear transformers. For both problems, we prove that simplified Muon converges linearly with iteration complexities independent of the relevant condition number, provably outperforming gradient descent and Adam. Our analysis reveals that the Muon dynamics decouple into a collection of independent scalar sequences in the spectral domain, each exhibiting similar convergence behavior.

Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel PRobabilistic variational imputation framework that leverages the power of large lAnguage models and retrIeval-augmented Memory (PRAIM). PRAIM employs a pre-trained language model to encode heterogeneous data, spanning time-series demand, calendar features, and geospatial context, into a unified, semantically rich representation. This is dynamically fortified by retrieval-augmented memory that retrieves relevant examples from the entire charging network, enabling a single, unified imputation model empowered by variational neural architecture to overcome data sparsity.

To address this gap, we leveraged a large-scale dataset of ~26M posts and ~45M comments on the BlueSky platform, and conducted a quasi-experimental study, matching 81,345 Treated users exposed to News feeds with 83,711 Control users using stratified propensity score analysis. We examined psychosocial wellbeing, in terms of affective, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that news engagement produces systematic trade-offs: increased depression, stress, and anxiety, yet decreased loneliness and increased social interaction on the platform. Regression models reveal that News feed bookmarking is associated with greater psychosocial deterioration compared to commenting or quoting, with magnitude differences exceeding tenfold. These per-engagement effects accumulate with repeated exposure, showing significant psychosocial impacts. Our work extends theories of news effects beyond crisis-centric frameworks by demonstrating that routine consumption creates distinct psychological dynamics depending on engagement type, and bears implications for tools and interventions for mitigating the psychosocial costs of news consumption on social media."}

CatMaster maintains a persistent project record of key facts, constraints, and file pointers to support inspection and restartability. It is paired with a multi-fidelity tool library that covers rapid surrogate relaxations and high-fidelity DFT calculations for validation when needed. We demonstrate CatMaster on four demonstrations of increasing complexity: an O2 spin-state check with remote execution, BCC Fe surface energies with a protocol-sensitivity study and CO adsorption site ranking, high-throughput Pt--Ni--Cu alloy screening for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) descriptors with surrogate-to-DFT validation, and a demonstration beyond the predefined tool set, including equation-of-state fitting for BCC Fe and CO-FeN4-graphene single-atom catalyst geometry preparation. By reducing manual scripting and bookkeeping while keeping the full evidence trail, CatMaster aims to help catalysis researchers focus on modeling choices and chemical interpretation rather than workflow management."}

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing. The code related to our work is publicly available to encourage further research."}

All access from attacking IPs is redirected to honeypot pods, achieving a lower incidence of 5XX status codes through HPA pod adjustments under high load conditions.

We address this issue by framing hallucination mitigation as contrastive guidance, steering generation toward visually grounded and semantically faithful text. This approach regulates the model's internal behavior by reducing over-dependence on language priors and contrasting visually grounded with language-only representations. We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions. Experiments on the CHAIR and POPE benchmarks show that ACG achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness and caption quality while significantly reducing computational cost. Our method establishes a principled and efficient alternative, reducing latency by up to 2x compared to prior contrastive decoding methods that require multiple forward passes."}

In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards."}

However, most existing methods assume regularly sampled observations and fixed output resolutions, which are often misaligned with real-world scenarios where data are irregularly sampled and sparsely observed. This mismatch is particularly problematic in applications such as clinical monitoring, where irregular measurements must support downstream tasks requiring continuous and high-resolution time series.\n  Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs) have shown strong potential for modeling irregular time series, yet they still face challenges in capturing complex dynamic temporal patterns and supporting continuous TSG. To address these limitations, we propose MN-TSG, a novel framework that explores Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based NCDEs and integrates them with existing TSG models for irregular and continuous generation tasks.\n  The core of MN-TSG lies in a MoE-NCDE architecture with dynamically parameterized expert functions and a decoupled design that facilitates more effective optimization of MoE dynamics. Furthermore, we leverage existing TSG models to learn the joint distribution over the mixture of experts and the generated time series. This enables the framework not only to generate new samples, but also to produce appropriate expert configurations tailored to each sample, thereby supporting refined continuous TSG.\n  Extensive experiments on ten public and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MN-TSG, consistently outperforming strong TSG baselines on both irregular-to-regular and irregular-to-continuous generation tasks."}

Drawing inspiration from the framing effect in psychology, we systematically investigate how deliberate prompt framing skews model judgments across four high-stakes evaluation tasks. We design symmetric prompts using predicate-positive and predicate-negative constructions and demonstrate that such framing induces significant discrepancies in model outputs. Across 14 LLM judges, we observe clear susceptibility to framing, with model families showing distinct tendencies toward agreement or rejection.

Variable orderings have a huge impact on its efficiency.

Variational inference is introduced to model the uncertainty in attention weights, thereby enhancing robustness to noise.

However, most existing approaches still view the brain as a set of loosely connected regions or impose oversimplified network priors, falling short of a truly holistic and self-organized dynamical system perspective. Brain functional connectivity (FC) at each time point naturally forms a symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix, which resides on a curved Riemannian manifold rather than in Euclidean space. Capturing the trajectories of these SPD matrices is key to understanding how coordinated networks support cognition and behavior.

GeoDynamics embeds each connectivity matrix into a manifold-aware recurrent framework, learning smooth and geometry-respecting transitions that reveal task-driven state changes and early markers of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and autism.

Code and checkpoints: https://github.com/zuraiqi/neural-organ-transplant", "summary": "We introduce Neural Organ Transplantation (NOT), a modular adaptation framework that enables trained transformer layers to function as reusable transferable checkpoints for domain adaptation. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that tightly couple trained parameters to specific model instances and training data, NOT extracts contiguous layer subsets (\"donor organs\") from pre-trained models, trains them independently on domain-specific data, and saves them as standalone checkpoint files that can be transplanted into compatible recipient models without access to the original training data. Through experiments on three decoder-only transformer architectures spanning 124M to 20B parameters (GPT-2, TinyLlama, and GPT-OSS), we demonstrate that donor transplantation substantially outperforms existing adaptation methods, achieving an order-of-magnitude improvement in perplexity over LoRA while training significantly faster. The method exhibits position dependence, with early insertion positions yielding optimal results. Cross-domain transfer at billion-parameter scale reveals unexpected regularization benefits. These findings demonstrate that transformer middle layers can support efficient modular transfer for decoder-only architectures, enabling privacy-preserving expertise sharing through checkpoint distribution. We note that this approach is currently limited to decoder-only models; preliminary experiments on encoder-based architectures show reduced effectiveness."}

In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-assisted approach for enhancing LLMs' reasoning capability in Legal that is generalizable to other high-stakes domains. We model key legal concepts by following the \\textbf{IRAC} (Issue, Rule, Analysis and Conclusion) framework, and construct a KG with 12K legal cases.

Our post-trained models obtained better average performance on 4/5 diverse legal benchmarks (14 tasks) than baselines. In particular, our 70B DPO model achieved the best score on 4/6 reasoning tasks, among baselines and a 141B SOTA legal LLM, demonstrating the effectiveness of our KG for enhancing LLMs' legal reasoning capability."}

TREX trains small-scale proxy tokenizers on random mixtures, gathers their compression statistics, and learns to predict compression performance from data mixtures. This learned model enables scalable mixture search before large-scale tokenizer training, mitigating the accuracy-cost trade-off in multilingual tokenizer design. Tokenizers trained with TReX's predicted mixtures outperform mixtures based on LLaMA3 and uniform distributions by up to 12% in both inand out-of-distribution compression efficiency, demonstrating strong scalability, robustness, and practical effectiveness."}

However, recent studies showcase that LLMs are susceptible to persuasion and could adopt counterfactual beliefs. We present a systematic evaluation of LLM susceptibility to persuasion under the Source--Message--Channel--Receiver (SMCR) communication framework. Across five mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) and three domains (factual knowledge, medical QA, and social bias), we analyze how different persuasive strategies influence belief stability over multiple interaction turns. We further examine whether meta-cognition prompting (i.e., eliciting self-reported confidence) affects resistance to persuasion. Results show that smaller models exhibit extreme compliance, with over 80% of belief changes occurring at the first persuasive turn (average end turn of 1.1--1.4). Contrary to expectations, meta-cognition prompting increases vulnerability by accelerating belief erosion rather than enhancing robustness. Finally, we evaluate adversarial fine-tuning as a defense. While GPT-4o-mini achieves near-complete robustness (98.6%) and Mistral~7B improves substantially (35.7% $\\rightarrow$ 79.3%), Llama models remain highly susceptible (<14%) even when fine-tuned on their own failure cases.

A residual convolutional neural network is employed to approximate the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for General Circulation Models (RRTMG) within the global operational system of China Meteorological Administration. We adopted an offline training and online coupling approach. First, a comprehensive dataset is generated through model simulations, encompassing all atmospheric columns both with and without cloud cover. To ensure the stability of the hybrid model, the dataset is enhanced via experience replay, and additional output constraints based on physical significance are imposed. Meanwhile, a LibTorch-based coupling method is utilized, which is more suitable for real-time operational computations. The hybrid model is capable of performing ten-day integrated forecasts as required. A two-month operational reforecast experiment demonstrates that the machine learning emulator achieves accuracy comparable to that of the traditional physical scheme, while accelerating the computation speed by approximately eightfold."}

Our approach first employs block diffusion to generate rapid drafts using small blocks, then refines these drafts through global bidirectional diffusion with a larger bidirectional receptive field. We utilise snapshot confidence remasking to identify the most critical tokens that require modification, and apply mix-scale training to expand the block diffusion model's global capabilities.

The initializer is pre-trained on a small set of measured paths using short two-phase inner loops that mimic identification followed by residual-noise reduction, and is applied by simply setting the learned initial coefficients. In an online secondary path modeling FxLMS testbed, it yields lower early-stage error, shorter time-to-target, reduced auxiliary-noise energy, and faster recovery after path changes than a baseline without re-initialization.

However, previous studies have demonstrated that LLM-as-a-judge can be biased towards different aspects of the judged texts, which often do not align with human preference. One of the identified biases is language bias, which indicates that the decision of LLM-as-a-judge can differ based on the language of the judged texts. In this paper, we study two types of language bias in pairwise LLM-as-a-judge: (1) performance disparity between languages when the judge is prompted to compare options from the same language, and (2) bias towards options written in major languages when the judge is prompted to compare options of two different languages. We find that for same-language judging, there exist significant performance disparities across language families, with European languages consistently outperforming African languages, and this bias is more pronounced in culturally-related subjects. For inter-language judging, we observe that most models favor English answers, and that this preference is influenced more by answer language than question language. Finally, we investigate whether language bias is in fact caused by low-perplexity bias, a previously identified bias of LLM-as-a-judge, and we find that while perplexity is slightly correlated with language bias, language bias cannot be fully explained by perplexity only."}

In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization."}

We present ANCHOR, a modular framework that makes decoupling and robustness explicit system-level primitives. ANCHOR separates (i) Canonical Records, an evolvable contract for the standardized shared state, from (ii) a communication bus for many-to-many dissemination and feedback-oriented coordination, forming an inspectable end-to-end loop. We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss. Overall, ANCHOR turns ad-hoc integration glue into explicit contracts, enabling controlled degradation under load and self-healing recovery for scalable deployment of closed-loop AI systems."}

Mainstream approaches based on modality-invariant and modality-specific factorization or on complex fusion still rely on spatiotemporal mixed modeling.

Hence, we propose TSDA, Temporal-Spatial Decouple before Act, which explicitly decouples each modality into temporal dynamics and spatial structural context before any interaction. For every modality, a temporal encoder and a spatial encoder project signals into separate temporal and spatial body. Factor-Consistent Cross-Modal Alignment then aligns temporal features only with their temporal counterparts across modalities, and spatial features only with their spatial counterparts. Factor specific supervision and decorrelation regularization reduce cross factor leakage while preserving complementarity. A Gated Recouple module subsequently recouples the aligned streams for task.

Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate."}

Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives.

We address this challenge by developing a Unified Information Pipeline that standardises heterogeneous datasets into a comparable information flow and evaluates a fixed, deployment-relevant detector under controlled cross-domain protocols. Across multiple domains, we find that structural factors, such as scene composition, object density, and contextual redundancy, explain cross-domain performance loss more strongly than visual degradation such as turbidity, with sparse scenes inducing a characteristic \"Context Collapse\" failure mode. We further validate operational feasibility by benchmarking inference on low-cost edge hardware, showing that runtime optimisation enables practical sampling rates for remote monitoring. The results shift emphasis from image enhancement toward structure-aware reliability, providing a democratised tool for consistent marine ecosystem assessment."}

Existing static compression methods often fail to preserve globally important information, principally because they overlook the attention drift phenomenon where token significance evolves dynamically. Although recent dynamic retrieval approaches attempt to address this issue, they typically suffer from coarse-grained caching strategies and incur high I/O overhead due to frequent data transfers. To overcome these limitations, we propose HeteroCache, a training-free dynamic compression framework. Our method is built on two key insights: attention heads exhibit diverse temporal heterogeneity, and there is significant spatial redundancy among heads within the same layer. Guided by these insights, HeteroCache categorizes heads based on stability and redundancy. Consequently, we apply a fine-grained weighting strategy that allocates larger cache budgets to heads with rapidly shifting attention to capture context changes, thereby addressing the inefficiency of coarse-grained strategies. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical storage mechanism in which a subset of representative heads monitors attention shift, and trigger an asynchronous, on-demand retrieval of contexts from the CPU, effectively hiding I/O latency. Finally, experiments demonstrate that HeteroCache achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple long-context benchmarks and accelerates decoding by up to $3\\times$ compared to the original model in the 224K context. Our code will be open-source."}

However, existing approaches often ignore the geometric symmetries of physical environments, leading to redundant behaviors and sample inefficiency. To address this, we introduce Group-Invariant Skill Discovery (GISD), a framework that explicitly embeds group structure into the skill discovery objective. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical guarantee: we prove that in group-symmetric environments, the standard Wasserstein dependency measure admits a globally optimal solution comprised of an equivariant policy and a group-invariant scoring function. Motivated by this, we formulate the Group-Invariant Wasserstein dependency measure, which restricts the optimization to this symmetry-aware subspace without loss of optimality. Practically, we parameterize the scoring function using a group Fourier representation and define the intrinsic reward via the alignment of equivariant latent features, ensuring that the discovered skills generalize systematically under group transformations. Experiments on state-based and pixel-based locomotion benchmarks demonstrate that GISD achieves broader state-space coverage and improved efficiency in downstream task learning compared to a strong baseline."}

Here, we present an end-to-end reverse screening strategy leveraging HelixFold3, a high-accuracy biomolecular structure prediction model akin to AlphaFold3, which simultaneously models the folding of proteins from a protein library and the docking of small-molecule ligands within a unified framework. We validate this approach on a diverse and representative set of approximately one hundred small molecules. Compared with conventional reverse docking, our method improves screening accuracy and demonstrates enhanced structural fidelity, binding-site precision, and target prioritization. By systematically linking small molecules to their protein targets, this framework establishes a scalable and straightforward platform for dissecting molecular mechanisms, exploring off-target interactions, and supporting rational drug discovery."}

Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets. Results demonstrate that auditory EEG consistently outperforms visual EEG, and cross-sensory training with CLS pooling achieves substantial improvements over individual training: 31% in MRR (0.474), 43% in Hit@1 (0.314), and 28% in Hit@10 (0.858). Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces.

In the last years global models, which are trained on a large collection of time series, have become popular for time series forecasting. Global models are often based on neural networks. However, they have not yet been exhaustively tested on intermittent time series. We carry out the first study comparing state-of-the-art local (iETS, TweedieGP) and global models (D-Linear, DeepAR, Transformers) on intermittent time series. For neural networks models we consider three different distribution heads suitable for intermittent time series: negative binomial, hurdle-shifted negative binomial and Tweedie. We use, for the first time, the last two distribution heads with neural networks. We perform experiments on five large datasets comprising more than 40'000 real-world time series. Among neural networks D-Linear provides best accuracy; it also consistently outperforms the local models. Moreover, it has also low computational requirements. Transformers-based architectures are instead much more computationally demanding and less accurate. Among the distribution heads, the Tweedie provides the best estimates of the highest quantiles, while the negative binomial offers overall the best performance."}

We first define Noisy Chernoff Difference, a tool that allows us to analyze the relationship among the triad simultaneously. We then show that for synthetic data, this value behaves in 3 distinct ways (depending on the distribution of the data). We highlight the data distributions involved in these cases and explore their fairness and privacy implications. Additionally, we show that Noisy Chernoff Difference acts as a proxy for the steepness of the fairness-accuracy curves. Finally, we propose a method for estimating Chernoff Information on data from unknown distributions and utilize this framework to examine the triad dynamic on real datasets.

In this paper, we rethink the role of the client side and propose Federated Balanced Learning, i.e., FBL, to prevent this issue from the beginning through sample balance on the client side. Technically, FBL allows unbalanced data on the client side to achieve sample balance through knowledge filling and knowledge sampling using edge-side generation models, under the limitation of a fixed number of data samples on clients. Furthermore, we design a Knowledge Alignment Strategy to bridge the gap between synthetic and real data, and a Knowledge Drop Strategy to regularize our method.

These models are then trained to maximize performance on metrics aligned with the task's objective. While the overall architecture is usually guided by prior knowledge of the task, the sizes of individual layers are often chosen heuristically. However, this approach does not guarantee an optimal trade-off between performance and computational complexity; consequently, post hoc methods such as weight quantization or model pruning are typically employed to reduce computational cost. This occurs because stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods can only optimize differentiable functions, while factors influencing computational complexity, such as layer sizes and floating-point operations per second (FLOP/s), are non-differentiable and require modifying the model structure during training. We propose a reparameterization technique based on feature noise injection that enables joint optimization of performance and computational complexity during training using SGD-based methods. Unlike traditional pruning methods, our approach allows the model size to be dynamically optimized for a target performance-complexity trade-off, without relying on heuristic criteria to select which weights or structures to remove. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through three case studies, including a synthetic example and two practical real-world applications: voice activity detection and audio anti-spoofing.

We propose Attention-space Contrastive Guidance (ACG), a single-pass mechanism that operates within self-attention layers to construct both vision-language and language-only attention paths in a single forward computation. This integration enables computationally efficient guidance directly embedded in the model's representation contextualization. To correct approximation bias introduced by the single-pass formulation, we further apply an orthogonalized correction that removes components aligned with the language-only path, selectively amplifying visual contributions.

Across 477 competition-level questions and 9 models, we find that SI fails systematically: (1) cutoff instructions leave a 52% performance gap between SI and TI; (2) chain-of-thought reasoning fails to suppress prior knowledge, even when reasoning traces contain no explicit post-cutoff references; (3) reasoning-optimized models exhibit worse SI fidelity despite superior reasoning trace quality. These findings demonstrate that prompts cannot reliably \"rewind\" model knowledge. We conclude that RF on pre-cutoff events is methodologically flawed; we recommend against using SI-based retrospective setups to benchmark forecasting capabilities."}

We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%.

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \\emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \\textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \\textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems."}

Transformers self-attention mechanisms have proven valuable for model interpretability, with attention weights successfully used to understand model focus and behavior (Xu et al., 2015); (Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019). However, existing attention-based explanation methods rely on manually defined aggregation strategies and fixed attribution rules (Abnar and Zuidema, 2020a); (Chefer et al., 2021), while model-agnostic approaches (LIME, SHAP) treat the model as a black box and incur significant computational costs through input perturbation. We introduce Explanation Network (ExpNet), a lightweight neural network that learns an explicit mapping from transformer attention patterns to token-level importance scores. Unlike prior methods, ExpNet discovers optimal attention feature combinations automatically rather than relying on predetermined rules. We evaluate ExpNet in a challenging cross-task setting and benchmark it against a broad spectrum of model-agnostic methods and attention-based techniques spanning four methodological families."}

The 3D model enables inspectors and customers to rotate, zoom, and slice through the undercarriage, allowing them to detect rust, leaks, or impact damage in seconds, thereby improving both workplace safety and buyer confidence. Our primary contribution is a rig-aware Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline specifically designed to overcome the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes. Our method overcomes the challenges of wide-angle lens distortion and low-parallax scenes by integrating precise camera calibration, synchronized video streams, and strong geometric priors from the camera rig. We use a constrained matching strategy with learned components, the DISK feature extractor, and the attention-based LightGlue matcher to generate high-quality sparse point clouds that are often unattainable with standard SfM pipelines. These point clouds seed the Gaussian splatting process to generate photorealistic undercarriage models that render in real-time.

This work introduces a novel concept of autonomous aerial manipulation system capable of interpreting high-level natural language commands to retrieve objects and deliver them to a human user. The system is intended to integrate a MediaPipe based on Grounding DINO and a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with a custom-built drone equipped with a 1-DOF gripper and an Intel RealSense RGB-D camera. VLA performs semantic reasoning to interpret the intent of a user prompt and generates a prioritized task queue for grasping of relevant objects in the scene. Grounding DINO and dynamic A* planning algorithm are used to navigate and safely relocate the object. To ensure safe and natural interaction during the handover phase, the system employs a human-centric controller driven by MediaPipe. This module provides real-time human pose estimation, allowing the drone to employ visual servoing to maintain a stable, distinct position directly in front of the user, facilitating a comfortable handover. We demonstrate the system's efficacy through real-world experiments for localization and navigation, which resulted in a 0.164m, 0.070m, and 0.084m of max, mean euclidean, and root-mean squared errors, respectively, highlighting the feasibility of VLA for aerial manipulation operations."}

This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications.

However, combining different models often causes problems in matching features and makes the system unstable. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) is introduced. It integrates segmentation and identification capabilities within one promptable model, which offers new possibilities for the OVCD task. In this paper, we propose OmniOVCD, a standalone framework designed for OVCD. By leveraging the decoupled output heads of SAM 3, we propose a Synergistic Fusion to Instance Decoupling (SFID) strategy. SFID first fuses the semantic, instance, and presence outputs of SAM 3 to construct land-cover masks, and then decomposes them into individual instance masks for change comparison. This design preserves high accuracy in category recognition and maintains instance-level consistency across images. As a result, the model can generate accurate change masks.

Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization. Experiments on HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets demonstrate that TractRLFusion outperforms individual RL policies as well as state-of-the-art classical and DRL methods in accuracy and anatomical reliability."}

To stabilize the training process and find a Nash equilibrium, we propose an asymmetric regularization mechanism based on the classic Tikhonov step and on a novel zero-centered gradient penalty. Under smoothness and a local identifiability condition induced by a Gauss-Newton Gramian, we obtain explicit Lipschitz and (strong)-monotonicity constants for the regularized operator. These constants ensure last-iterate linear convergence of a single-call Extrapolation-from-the-Past (EFTP) method. Empirical simulations on an academic example show that, even when strong monotonicity cannot be achieved, the asymmetric regularization is enough to converge to an equilibrium and stabilize the trajectory."}

Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a \"diverge-then-converge\" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics. Experiments on multi-query benchmarks demonstrate that IF-GEO achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across diverse retrieval scenarios."}

To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon."}

Recent research has demonstrated that neural audio codec (NAC) provides superior speaker feature disentanglement and linguistic fidelity. NAC can also be used with causal language models (LM) to enhance linguistic fidelity and prompt control for streaming tasks. However, existing NAC-based online LM systems are designed for voice conversion (VC) rather than anonymization, lacking the techniques required for privacy protection. Building on these advances, we present Stream-Voice-Anon, which adapts modern causal LM-based NAC architectures specifically for streaming SA by integrating anonymization techniques. Our anonymization approach incorporates pseudo-speaker representation sampling, a speaker embedding mixing and diverse prompt selection strategies for LM conditioning that leverage the disentanglement properties of quantized content codes to prevent speaker information leakage. Additionally, we compare dynamic and fixed delay configurations to explore latency-privacy trade-offs in real-time scenarios. Under the VoicePrivacy 2024 Challenge protocol, Stream-Voice-Anon achieves substantial improvements in intelligibility (up to 46% relative WER reduction) and emotion preservation (up to 28% UAR relative) compared to the previous state-of-the-art streaming method DarkStream while maintaining comparable latency (180ms vs 200ms) and privacy protection against lazy-informed attackers, though showing 15% relative degradation against semi-informed attackers."}

While leveraging diverse teachers seems appealing, effectively fusing their supervisions remains challenging: teacher-student incompatibility risks amplifying hallucinations, and passive supervision fails to ensure genuine logic internalization. To address this, we introduce COMPACT, a framework that adaptively fuses supervisions from different teachers by dynamically weighting teacher gradients based on the student's real-time compatibility evaluated by a multi-dimensional metric: (1) Graph-based Consensus to filter misleading rationales by identifying mainstream reasoning paths; (2) Mutual-Information-based Adaptability to detect \"epiphany moments\" for genuinely understanding the reasoning process rather than merely imitating; and (3) Loss-based Difficulty to assess student receptivity to the teacher's guidance and prevent negative transfer.

We propose Duration-Aware Matryoshka Embedding (DAME), a model-agnostic framework that builds a nested hierarchy of sub-embeddings aligned to utterance durations: lower-dimensional representations capture compact speaker traits from short utterances, while higher dimensions encode richer details from longer speech. DAME supports both training from scratch and fine-tuning, and serves as a direct alternative to conventional large-margin fine-tuning, consistently improving performance across durations. On the VoxCeleb1-O/E/H and VOiCES evaluation sets, DAME consistently reduces the equal error rate on 1-s and other short-duration trials, while maintaining full-length performance with no additional inference cost. These gains generalize across various speaker encoder architectures under both general training and fine-tuning setups."}

The approach isolates technology-specific effects by holding the observed speed profile and environmental context fixed, enabling direct comparison of powertrain performance. Recurrent neural network models are trained independently for each domain to learn the mapping from contextual driving variables (speed, acceleration, temperature) to internal actuation variables (torque, throttle) and instantaneous CO2-equivalent emission rates. This structure allows the construction of counterfactual scenarios that answer: What emissions would an EV have generated if it had followed the same driving profile as an ICEV? By aligning both vehicle types on a unified instantaneous emissions metric, the framework enables fair and reproducible evaluation of powertrain technologies. It offers a scalable foundation for credible, data-driven assessments of vehicle carbon performance under real-world operating conditions."}

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models.

However, the potential of DLMs remains largely untapped as they are frequently confined within AR-legacy infrastructures and optimization frameworks. In this Perspective, we identify ten fundamental challenges ranging from architectural inertia and gradient sparsity to the limitations of linear reasoning that prevent DLMs from reaching their ``GPT-4 moment''. We propose a strategic roadmap organized into four pillars: foundational infrastructure, algorithmic optimization, cognitive reasoning, and unified multimodal intelligence. By shifting toward a diffusion-native ecosystem characterized by multi-scale tokenization, active remasking, and latent thinking, we can move beyond the constraints of the causal horizon. We argue that this transition is essential for developing next-generation AI capable of complex structural reasoning, dynamic self-correction, and seamless multimodal integration."}

To address these limitations, we introduce a framework for Positioning Objects Consistently and Interactively (POCI-Diff), a novel formulation for jointly enforcing 3D geometric constraints and instance-level semantic binding within a unified diffusion process. Our method enables explicit per-object semantic control by binding individual text descriptions to specific 3D bounding boxes through Blended Latent Diffusion, allowing one-shot synthesis of complex multi-object scenes.

Using a hierarchical annotation schema with 22 main questions (single-choice, multi-choice, and open-ended), expert dermatologists annotated each image for diagnosis, anatomic site, lesion morphology, distribution, surface features, color, and image quality, together with open-ended narrative descriptions and summaries, yielding approximately 14.474 VQA-style annotations. DermaBench is released as a metadata-only dataset to respect upstream licensing and is publicly available at Harvard Dataverse."}

Causal feature selection can enhance the performance of soft sensor models in industrial applications. However, existing methods ignore two critical characteristics of industrial processes. Firstly, causal relationships between variables always involve time delays, whereas most causal feature selection methods investigate causal relationships in the same time dimension. Secondly, variables in industrial processes are often interdependent, which contradicts the decorrelation assumption of traditional causal inference methods. Consequently, soft sensor models based on existing causal feature selection approaches often lack sufficient accuracy and stability. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a causal feature selection framework based on time-delayed cross mapping. Time-delayed cross mapping employs state space reconstruction to effectively handle interdependent variables in causality analysis, and considers varying causal strength across time delay. Time-delayed convergent cross mapping (TDCCM) is introduced for total causal inference, and time-delayed partial cross mapping (TDPCM) is developed for direct causal inference. Then, in order to achieve automatic feature selection, an objective feature selection strategy is presented. The causal threshold is automatically determined based on the model performance on the validation set, and the causal features are then selected. Two real-world case studies show that TDCCM achieves the highest average performance, while TDPCM improves soft sensor stability and performance in the worst scenario. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/dirge1/TDPCM."}

This limitation introduces significant geometric distortion when representing real-world graphs with inherent non-Euclidean structures (e.g., hierarchies and cycles), degrading representation quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Riemannian Liquid Spatio-Temporal Graph Network (RLSTG), a framework that unifies continuous-time liquid dynamics with the geometric inductive biases of Riemannian manifolds. RLSTG models graph evolution through an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formulated directly on a curved manifold, enabling it to faithfully capture the intrinsic geometry of both structurally static and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for RLSTG, extending stability theorems of LTCs to the Riemannian domain and quantifying its expressive power via state trajectory analysis. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that, by combining advanced temporal dynamics with a Riemannian spatial representation, RLSTG achieves superior performance on graphs with complex structures.

Using the CARMA Arabic mental health corpus, which exhibits a substantial gender imbalance, we focus on male-to-female style transfer to augment underrepresented female-authored content. We construct five datasets capturing varying linguistic and semantic aspects of gender expression in Arabic and train separate diffusion models for each setting. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate consistently high semantic fidelity between source and generated text, alongside meaningful surface-level stylistic divergence, while qualitative analysis confirms linguistically plausible gender transformations. Our results show that diffusion-based style transfer can generate high-entropy, semantically faithful synthetic data without reliance on pretrained LLMs, providing an effective and flexible framework for mitigating gender bias in sensitive, low-resource mental health domains."}

The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern neural models. We first operationalize a binary moral presence task (\"does any value appear?\") and show that it is learnable from single sentences (positive-class F1 $\\approx$ 0.74 with calibrated thresholds). We then compare a presence-gated hierarchy to a direct multi-label classifier under matched compute, both based on DeBERTa-base and augmented with lightweight signals (prior-sentence context, LIWC-22/eMFD/MJD lexica, and topic features). The hierarchy does not outperform direct prediction, indicating that gate recall limits downstream gains. We also benchmark instruction-tuned LLMs - Gemma 2 9B, Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 8B, and Qwen 2.5 7B - in zero-/few-shot and QLoRA setups and build simple ensembles; a soft-vote supervised ensemble reaches macro-F1 0.332, significantly surpassing the best single supervised model and exceeding prior English-only baselines. Overall, in this scenario, lightweight signals and small ensembles yield the most reliable improvements, while hierarchical gating offers limited benefit. We argue that, under an 8 GB single-GPU constraint and at the 7-9B scale, carefully tuned supervised encoders remain a strong and compute-efficient baseline for structured human value detection, and we outline how richer value structure and sentence-in-document context could further improve performance."}

We argue that incorrect predictions arise when small errors in the attention mechanism accumulate to cross a threshold, and use this insight to derive a quantitative two-parameter relationship between the accuracy and the complexity of the task. The two parameters vary with the prompt and the model; they can be interpreted in terms of an elementary noise rate, and the number of plausible erroneous tokens that can be predicted. Our analysis is inspired by an ``effective field theory'' perspective: the LLM's many raw parameters can be reorganized into just two parameters that govern the error rate. We perform extensive empirical tests, using Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Pro and DeepSeek R1, and find excellent agreement between the predicted and observed accuracy for a variety of tasks, although we also identify deviations in some cases. Our model provides an alternative to suggestions that errors made by LLMs on long repetitive tasks indicate the ``collapse of reasoning'', or an inability to express ``compositional'' functions.

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b."}

We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective socio-collaborative companions. MASCOT introduces a novel bi-level optimization strategy to harmonize individual and collective behaviors: 1) Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, an RLAIF-driven pipeline that finetunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss; and 2) Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, a meta-policy guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate that MASCOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of up to +14.1 in Persona Consistency and +10.6 in Social Contribution.

Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign.

Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian\nAngular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature\nextraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that\nsensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the\nfirst to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across\nheterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication\nefficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the\nframework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4,\nreflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of\n95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client\nbaseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational\ncomplexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource\nutilization and communication overhead.

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$.

RLoop transforms the standard\ntraining process into a virtuous cycle: it first uses RL to explore the\nsolution space from a given policy, then filters the successful trajectories to\ncreate an expert dataset. This dataset is used via Rejection-sampling\nFine-Tuning (RFT) to refine the initial policy, creating a superior starting\npoint for the next iteration. This loop of exploration and exploitation via\niterative re-initialization effectively converts transient policy variations\ninto robust performance gains. Our experiments show RLoop mitigates forgetting\nand substantially improves generalization, boosting average accuracy by 9% and\npass@32 by over 15% compared to vanilla RL."}

The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM).

Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

We break this\ntrade-off with a framework for context-efficient on-device agents, driven by\nthree synergistic optimizations (1) a dynamic memory system using specialized\nLoRA adapters to distill conversational history into a compressed, and\nstructured Context State Object; (2) a minimalist serialization format for tool\nschemas to minimize token overhead per tool; and (3) a just-in-time\nschema-passing mechanism that loads full tool definitions only upon tool\nselection.

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area.

We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code.

It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention.

In this study,\nwe look at LLMs and cultural values and examine how prompt language and\ncultural framing influence model responses and their alignment with human\nvalues in different countries. We probe 10 LLMs with 63 items from the Hofstede\nValues Survey Module and World Values Survey, translated into 11 languages, and\nformulated as prompts with and without different explicit cultural\nperspectives. Our study confirms that both prompt language and cultural\nperspective produce variation in LLM outputs, but with an important caveat:\nWhile targeted prompting can, to a certain extent, steer LLM responses in the\ndirection of the predominant values of the corresponding countries, it does not\novercome the models' systematic bias toward the values associated with a\nrestricted set of countries in our dataset: the Netherlands, Germany, the US,\nand Japan.

Alignment\nwith cultural values of human respondents is improved more with an explicit\ncultural perspective than with a targeted prompt language.

Findings present the anonymized, real\nresponses and circumstances of respondents in the form of twelve fictional\npersonas of high-level decision makers from North America and Europe. These\npersonas illustrate how personal agency, organizational logics, and\ninstitutional infrastructures may intersect in the governance of AI. The\ndecision makers' responses to the questionnaires then inform a discussion of\nthe field-level personal power of decision makers, methods of fostering\ninstitutional stability in times of change, and methods of influencing\ninstitutional change in the field of AI. The final section of the discussion\npresents a table of the dynamics of the levers of power in the field of AI for\nchange makers and five testable hypotheses for institutional and social\nmovement researchers. In summary, this study provides insight on the means for\npolicymakers within institutions and their counterparts in civil society to\npersonally engage with AI governance."}

Computed Tomography\n(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate\ncardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow\nvelocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.\n  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved\nframework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.\n  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel\nbifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with\nvarying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.\nWe compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed\nimages (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.\n  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by\navoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was\nrobust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower\nmean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow\nwas compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with\nshorter pulse widths.\n  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based\nflow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood\nflow assessment.

However, it remains challenging to\ngenerate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across\ndifferent patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad\nmeshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh\ncorrespondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus\nenhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling."}

First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a\nmixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by\nstrategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with\ndifferent precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate\ncompression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise\nadaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations\nwhile dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a\nunified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,\nquantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and\nlatency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware\nplatforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nquantization methods, including SmoothQuant, OmniQuant, and Atom. The framework\nachieves a 1.49 inference speedup and significant communication overhead\nreduction while maintaining or improving model accuracy."}

We evaluate 23 LLMs across four tasks: (T1) selecting key\nresponsible AI values, (T2) rating their importance in specific contexts, (T3)\nresolving trade-offs between competing values, and (T4) prioritizing software\nrequirements that embody those values. The results show that LLMs generally\nalign more closely with AI practitioners than with the US-representative\nsample, emphasizing fairness, privacy, transparency, safety, and\naccountability. However, inconsistencies appear between the values that LLMs\nclaim to uphold (Tasks 1-3) and the way they prioritize requirements (Task 4),\nrevealing gaps in faithfulness between stated and applied behavior. These\nfindings highlight the practical risk of relying on LLMs in requirements\nengineering without human oversight and motivate the need for systematic\napproaches to benchmark, interpret, and monitor value alignment in AI-assisted\nsoftware development."}

Despite its significance, tokenization in the\ncontext of assembly code remains an underexplored area. This study aims to\naddress this gap by evaluating the intrinsic properties of Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tokenization models and parameter choices, such as vocabulary\nsize. We explore preprocessing customization options and pre-tokenization rules\ntailored to the unique characteristics of assembly code. Additionally, we\nassess their impact on downstream tasks like function signature prediction -- a\ncritical problem in binary code analysis.\n  To this end, we conduct a thorough study on various tokenization models,\nsystematically analyzing their efficiency in encoding assembly instructions and\ncapturing semantic nuances. Through intrinsic evaluations, we compare\ntokenizers based on tokenization efficiency, vocabulary compression, and\nrepresentational fidelity for assembly code. Using state-of-the-art pre-trained\nmodels such as the decoder-only Large Language Model (LLM) Llama 3.2, the\nencoder-only transformer BERT, and the encoder-decoder model BART, we evaluate\nthe effectiveness of these tokenizers across multiple performance metrics.\nPreliminary findings indicate that tokenizer choice significantly influences\ndownstream performance, with intrinsic metrics providing partial but incomplete\npredictability of extrinsic evaluation outcomes. These results reveal complex\ntrade-offs between intrinsic tokenizer properties and their utility in\npractical assembly code tasks. Ultimately, this study provides valuable\ninsights into optimizing tokenization models for low-level code analysis,\ncontributing to the robustness and scalability of Natural Language Model\n(NLM)-based binary analysis workflows."}

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method. In addition, we performed a custom point-based\nevaluation using ten manually selected key points. Registration was done\nseparately for two scenarios, using either the original or inverted multimodal\nimages. In both scenarios, CycleGAN color transformation achieved the lowest\nregistration errors, while the other methods showed higher errors. These\nfindings show that applying color transformation before registration improves\nalignment between images from different modalities and supports more reliable\nanalysis in digital pathology."}

Shannon\nentropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information\nencoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold,\nand Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information\nencoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding\nsimilarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was\nintroduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare,\nand which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually,\nanalytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show\nthat LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary\ninformation about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both\nLCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of\n``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an\nupper bound on LCR for several values of the R\\'enyi-Hill order parameter and\nconjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is\npreferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more\nfundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a\nquantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks\nsimply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored;\nnevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each\nother."}

Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods.

Our\nproposed model, MedSapiens, demonstrates that human-centric foundation models,\ninherently optimized for spatial pose localization, provide strong priors for\nanatomical landmark detection, yet this potential has remained largely\nuntapped. We benchmark MedSapiens against existing state-of-the-art models,\nachieving up to 5.26% improvement over generalist models and up to 21.81%\nimprovement over specialist models in the average success detection rate (SDR).\nTo further assess MedSapiens adaptability to novel downstream tasks with few\nannotations, we evaluate its performance in limited-data settings, achieving\n2.69% improvement over the few-shot state of the art in SDR.

Each model\npredicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the\nnormalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of\nnormalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\\eta_e$), and\nthe electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\\tau$). We first construct models\nacross seven radial locations using regression and an active\nmachine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using\nlow-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their\ntraining sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing\nsimulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models\nusing out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\\%$\nprediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction\nuncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced\nmodels, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat\nflux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models\ndemonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the\noriginal reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain."}

Specifically, the idea and objective in Riesz\nregression coincide with the one in least-squares importance fitting (LSIF,\nKanamori et al., 2009) in direct density-ratio estimation. While Riesz\nregression is general in the sense that it can be applied to Riesz representer\nestimation in a wide class of problems, the equivalence with DRE allows us to\ndirectly import exist- ing results in specific cases, including\nconvergence-rate analyses, the selection of loss functions via\nBregman-divergence minimization, and regularization techniques for flexible\nmodels, such as neural networks.

Coordination at the trajectory\nlevel often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into\nconflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of\nabstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable\nsynchronization and collective progress. We present DR. WELL, a decentralized\nneurosymbolic framework for cooperative multi-agent planning. Cooperation\nunfolds through a two-phase negotiation protocol: agents first propose\ncandidate roles with reasoning and then commit to a joint allocation under\nconsensus and environment constraints. After commitment, each agent\nindependently generates and executes a symbolic plan for its role without\nrevealing detailed trajectories. Plans are grounded in execution outcomes via a\nshared world model that encodes the current state and is updated as agents act.\nBy reasoning over symbolic plans rather than raw trajectories, DR. WELL avoids\nbrittle step-level alignment and enables higher-level operations that are\nreusable, synchronizable, and interpretable. Experiments on cooperative\nblock-push tasks show that agents adapt across episodes, with the dynamic world\nmodel capturing reusable patterns and improving task completion rates and\nefficiency. Experiments on cooperative block-push tasks show that our dynamic\nworld model improves task completion and efficiency through negotiation and\nself-refinement, trading a time overhead for evolving, more efficient\ncollaboration strategies."}

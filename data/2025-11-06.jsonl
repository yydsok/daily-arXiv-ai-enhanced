We present ALAS,\na stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from\nnon-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks\nand restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in\nprogress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh,\nbounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The\nrepair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies\n(retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards)\ndefined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo\nWorkflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical\nbenchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent\nbaselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running\n1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows\nthat the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and\nthat localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius\nand less makespan degradation than global recompute.

As this\nproblem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions,\nadvancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions\nthat reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic\nscenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to\nlearn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics,\ndegrading their performance when deployed.

LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing\nhuman psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from\nLLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 >\n0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on\nsemantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms\ntrained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that\nLLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five\nresponses into natural language personality summaries through information\nselection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics.\nSecond, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these\nsummaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality\nfactors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item\nimportance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely\nredundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to\noriginal scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent,\nsecond-order patterns of trait interplay.

Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space.

The framework's\nproperties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic\ncase study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting\npreferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment\ntask. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base\nscores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and\ncontextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and\ncontext-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work\nadvances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to\ndata-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world\nenvironments."}

We propose a paired,\ndiffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real\nimage, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is\nused as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which\nmixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard\nmask.

However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance.

(2)\nWatermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping\neach criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and\ndetectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since\ninteroperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we\npropose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking\nComparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the\noperationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all\nfour standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further\nresearch into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture\nof LLMs."}

Under Review", "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using\npolicy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods\ntypically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each\nprompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),\nreducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.\n  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages\nfor each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we\npropose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt\nmeans to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --\nparticularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we\nconstruct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance\npolicy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a\ndrop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no\nadditional hyper-parameters or computation.

Through meticulous document screening and a systematic\nquestion-design methodology, the dataset guarantees both diversity and high\nquality, rendering it applicable to various NLP tasks such as document\ncomprehension, knowledge extraction, and intelligent QA systems. Additionally,\nthis paper offers a comprehensive overview of the dataset's design objectives,\nconstruction methodologies, and fine-grained evaluation system, supplying a\nsubstantial foundation for future research and practical applications in\nChinese QA. The code and data are available at:\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/Foxit-CHiMDQA/."}

While neural click models have emerged over the\npast decade, complex click models based on probabilistic graphical models\n(PGMs) have not systematically adopted gradient-based optimization, preventing\npractitioners from leveraging modern deep learning frameworks while preserving\nthe interpretability of classic models. CLAX addresses this gap by replacing\nEM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically\nstable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any\ncomponent, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic\nclick models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by\nrunning experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion\nuser sessions in $\\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster\nthan traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models,\nserving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and\nimprove ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click\nmodels.

Traditional\nbeamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean\nsquare error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under\nadverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an\nalternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to\nbeamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel\nenvironments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their\nability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However,\ntheir quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids.\nRecent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that\nreduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns\nthat disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for\nwireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware\nSparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that\nincorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user\nsingle-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure\nis configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is\ntheoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the\nnumber of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel\nconditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a\nfixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional\nbeamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios,\nwhile maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys\nper query."}

Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data\naugmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between\ntext and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD\nfocus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating\nexplanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by\ntheir over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that\nlack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it\ndifficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our\nstudy, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an\ninterpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target\nimplicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and\nexplicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers\nstance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the\nrelevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model\ntowards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales,\nthus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales\nbased on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive\ndimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's\nattitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark\ndatasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10%\ntraining data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the\nproposed architecture and interpretable design."}

In\nthis work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL)\nframework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature\nlearning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a\ndual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear\ndetail and broader tissue-level context.

Performance further improves with higher\nmagnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x.

To capture the statistical price\nof this ignorance, we introduce the regret inflation criterion, defined as the\nratio between the regret of an adaptive algorithm and that of an oracle knowing\n$\\alpha$. We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomial with the\nhorizon $T$, with exponent precisely given by the value of a convex\noptimization problem involving the dimension, smoothness, and batch budget.\nMoreover, the minimizers of this optimization problem directly prescribe the\nbatch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm. Building\non this principle, we develop RoBIN (RObust batched algorithm with adaptive\nBINning), which achieves the optimal regret inflation up to logarithmic\nfactors. These results reveal a new adaptivity barrier: under batching,\nadaptation to an unknown margin parameter inevitably incurs a polynomial\npenalty, sharply characterized by a variational problem.

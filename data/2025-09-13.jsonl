In most such applications, an assumption is made of\nprecise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is\nunrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information\nfrom subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates\nof the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two\nkey contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version.\nFirst, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and\nconservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs\nthat otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel\nand flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy\nmembership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities\nin Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this\nproblem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for\nComputing with Words applications."}

This\nhierarchical disentanglement allows flexible feature selection, making DeCodec\na universal front-end for multiple audio applications.

On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.

To address this, we\npropose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a\nHybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and\nbending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,\nwhile TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress\nmagnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains\nmotion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect\ncorresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and\n(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor\ntorque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional\nsensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation\nby about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical\nlimiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of\nstructural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the\nproposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation."}

However, many teams (firefighters, military,\nlaw enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in\nphysical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit\ncommunication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial\ncoordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and\nadaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative\nonline search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and\nteam members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and\ncoordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by\nmeasuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements\nwithin shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136\nparticipants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task.\nResults show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while\nadaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship,\nsuggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal.

To address this, we propose PerFairX, a unified\nevaluation framework designed to quantify the trade-offs between\npersonalization and demographic equity in LLM-generated recommendations. Using\nneutral and personality-sensitive prompts across diverse user profiles, we\nbenchmark two state-of-the-art LLMs, ChatGPT and DeepSeek, on movie (MovieLens\n10M) and music (Last.fm 360K) datasets. Our results reveal that\npersonality-aware prompting significantly improves alignment with individual\ntraits but can exacerbate fairness disparities across demographic groups.\nSpecifically, DeepSeek achieves stronger psychological fit but exhibits higher\nsensitivity to prompt variations, while ChatGPT delivers stable yet less\npersonalized outputs. PerFairX provides a principled benchmark to guide the\ndevelopment of LLM-based recommender systems that are both equitable and\npsychologically informed, contributing to the creation of inclusive,\nuser-centric AI applications in continual learning contexts."}

Previous methods mainly focus\non creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional\nreinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by\nusing Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we\nidentify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude\nof policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to\ninefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially\ndestabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose\nEntropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the\nlearning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome.

To evaluate this approach, we assessed both the point and\nprobabilistic prediction performance of KpR, using the TabPFN model across six\nfieldscale datasets from LimeSoDa.

Existing approaches typically adopt uniform\nframe sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.\nHowever, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to\ncritical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,\nwe propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal\nawareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a\nsemantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.\nSpecifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp\ntokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further\nreformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and\nintroduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal\ncoverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with\nthe vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally\nregularized greedy strategy.

Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks.

However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of\nmodality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and\ncannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their\napplication in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nFlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate\nflexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal\nand tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse\ntransforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition\ninputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion\nprocess and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration\nprocess, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal\ninformation from source images, independently of the number of input images. We\ncompared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them\non Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics.

In the second\nstage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in\nparallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework\npreserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent\nbehind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and\nstable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world\napplications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging.

The RIME algorithm is a recently proposed physical-based\nmetaheuristic algorithm with certain advantages. However, it suffers from rapid\nloss of population diversity during optimization and is prone to fall into\nlocal optima, leading to unbalanced exploitation and exploration. To address\nthe shortcomings of RIME, this paper proposes a modified RIME with covariance\nlearning and diversity enhancement (MRIME-CD). The algorithm applies three\nstrategies to improve the optimization capability. First, a covariance learning\nstrategy is introduced in the soft-rime search stage to increase the population\ndiversity and balance the over-exploitation ability of RIME through the\nbootstrapping effect of dominant populations. Second, in order to moderate the\ntendency of RIME population to approach the optimal individual in the early\nsearch stage, an average bootstrapping strategy is introduced into the\nhard-rime puncture mechanism, which guides the population search through the\nweighted position of the dominant populations, thus enhancing the global search\nability of RIME in the early stage. Finally, a new stagnation indicator is\nproposed, and a stochastic covariance learning strategy is used to update the\nstagnant individuals in the population when the algorithm gets stagnant, thus\nenhancing the ability to jump out of the local optimal solution. The proposed\nMRIME-CD algorithm is subjected to a series of validations on the CEC2017 test\nset, the CEC2022 test set, and the experimental results are analyzed using the\nFriedman test, the Wilcoxon rank sum test, and the Kruskal Wallis test. The\nresults show that MRIME-CD can effectively improve the performance of basic\nRIME and has obvious superiorities in terms of solution accuracy, convergence\nspeed and stability."}

However, the\ninherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical\nspecificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital\npathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in\nsimulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,\nwe extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image\ntranslation to generate artificially stained slices from\nsynchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image\npairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant\nsamples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired\ndata. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of\nthe CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The\nmodel incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,\nproducing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving\nhigh-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard\nCycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the\nmodel can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D\ndatasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.\nWhile features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some\nvariability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need\nfor further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining\nto 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,\nlabel-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research."}

Extensive\nexperiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior\nrobustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.\nAdditionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using\ndiverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes\nbeyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language\nrepresentations."}

Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow\nmatching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from\nslow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have\nbeen widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to\nexplore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential\nof discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing\nflow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous\nspace and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the\nadvantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model\nto explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS\nexplicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified\narchitecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual\ncontent, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference\nspeech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In\naddition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with\ndistinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn\naspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS\nachieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,\nprosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control.

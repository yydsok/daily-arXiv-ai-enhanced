### [1] [MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858)
*Charles L. Wang,Trisha Singhal,Ameya Kelkar,Jason Tuo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MI9是首个针对代理型AI系统的运行时治理框架，通过六种集成组件实时控制风险，填补传统治理方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理型AI系统在运行时表现出不可预测的行为，传统预部署治理无法完全应对其风险，亟需新的治理框架。

Method: MI9框架包含六种组件：代理风险指数、代理语义遥测捕获、持续授权监控、FSM一致性引擎、目标条件漂移检测和分级遏制策略。

Result: MI9在多样化场景中展示了系统性治理能力，解决了现有方法无法应对的挑战。

Conclusion: MI9为代理型AI的安全部署提供了技术基础，支持大规模应用。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions
present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI
models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected
behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be
fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this
critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance
framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems.
MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components:
agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization
monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines,
goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies.
Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables
the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in
production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short,
providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at
scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's
systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to
address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI
oversight.

### [2] [Evo-MARL: Co-Evolutionary Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Internalized Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03864)
*Zhenyu Pan,Yiting Zhang,Yutong Zhang,Jianshu Zhang,Haozheng Luo,Yuwei Han,Dennis Wu,Hong-Yu Chen,Philip S. Yu,Manling Li,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Evo-MARL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过让所有任务智能体共同获得防御能力，解决现有防御方法依赖外部模块的问题，同时提升系统安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在开放性和交互复杂性增加时面临安全风险（如越狱和对抗攻击），现有防御方法依赖外部模块，存在保护有限和单点故障问题。

Method: 提出Evo-MARL框架，通过多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练每个智能体同时执行主任务和防御任务，结合进化搜索和参数共享强化学习，实现攻击者与防御者的共同进化。

Result: 实验表明，Evo-MARL将攻击成功率降低22%，推理任务准确率提升5%，证明安全性和实用性可同时提升。

Conclusion: Evo-MARL通过内部化安全机制和持续进化，显著提升了多智能体系统的安全性和性能，避免了外部模块的缺陷。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on multimodal large language models exhibit
strong collaboration and performance. However, their growing openness and
interaction complexity pose serious risks, notably jailbreak and adversarial
attacks. Existing defenses typically rely on external guard modules, such as
dedicated safety agents, to handle unsafe behaviors. Unfortunately, this
paradigm faces two challenges: (1) standalone agents offer limited protection,
and (2) their independence leads to single-point failure-if compromised,
system-wide safety collapses. Naively increasing the number of guard agents
further raises cost and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Evo-MARL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that
enables all task agents to jointly acquire defensive capabilities. Rather than
relying on external safety modules, Evo-MARL trains each agent to
simultaneously perform its primary function and resist adversarial threats,
ensuring robustness without increasing system overhead or single-node failure.
Furthermore, Evo-MARL integrates evolutionary search with parameter-sharing
reinforcement learning to co-evolve attackers and defenders. This adversarial
training paradigm internalizes safety mechanisms and continually enhances MAS
performance under co-evolving threats. Experiments show that Evo-MARL reduces
attack success rates by up to 22% while boosting accuracy by up to 5% on
reasoning tasks-demonstrating that safety and utility can be jointly improved.

### [3] [MOTIF: Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03929)
*Nguyen Viet Tuan Kiet,Dao Van Tung,Tran Cong Dao,Huynh Thi Thanh Binh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MOTIF框架通过多策略优化和交互式LLM代理，提升组合优化问题的求解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在组合优化问题中仅优化单一组件的局限性，探索多组件协同优化的潜力。

Method: 提出MOTIF框架，基于蒙特卡洛树搜索，通过两个LLM代理的轮流优化实现多策略协同。

Result: 在多个组合优化领域实验中，MOTIF表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MOTIF展示了多代理交互式提示在自动化求解器设计中的潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective algorithmic components remains a fundamental obstacle in
tackling NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), where solvers
often rely on carefully hand-crafted strategies. Despite recent advances in
using large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality components, most
approaches restrict the search to a single element - commonly a heuristic
scoring function - thus missing broader opportunities for innovation. In this
paper, we introduce a broader formulation of solver design as a multi-strategy
optimization problem, which seeks to jointly improve a set of interdependent
components under a unified objective. To address this, we propose
Multi-strategy Optimization via Turn-based Interactive Framework (MOTIF) - a
novel framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search that facilitates turn-based
optimization between two LLM agents. At each turn, an agent improves one
component by leveraging the history of both its own and its opponent's prior
updates, promoting both competitive pressure and emergent cooperation. This
structured interaction broadens the search landscape and encourages the
discovery of diverse, high-performing solutions. Experiments across multiple
COP domains show that MOTIF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
highlighting the promise of turn-based, multi-agent prompting for fully
automated solver design.

### [4] [Generic-to-Specific Reasoning and Learning for Scalable Ad Hoc Teamwork](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04163)
*Hasra Dodampegama,Mohan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合知识驱动和数据驱动的方法，用于提升AI代理在临时团队协作中的决策能力，解决了现有方法依赖大数据、缺乏透明性和难以快速更新的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有临时团队协作方法依赖大数据且缺乏透明性，难以适应动态变化。论文旨在结合知识驱动和数据驱动的优势，提升协作效率。

Method: 采用非单调逻辑推理，结合领域常识知识、快速学习的行为预测模型和基于基础模型的未来目标预测。

Result: 在VirtualHome仿真环境中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合知识驱动和数据驱动的方法能够显著提升临时团队协作的效率和适应性。

Abstract: AI agents deployed in assistive roles often have to collaborate with other
agents (humans, AI systems) without prior coordination. Methods considered
state of the art for such ad hoc teamwork often pursue a data-driven approach
that needs a large labeled dataset of prior observations, lacks transparency,
and makes it difficult to rapidly revise existing knowledge in response to
changes. As the number of agents increases, the complexity of decision-making
makes it difficult to collaborate effectively. This paper advocates leveraging
the complementary strengths of knowledge-based and data-driven methods for
reasoning and learning for ad hoc teamwork. For any given goal, our
architecture enables each ad hoc agent to determine its actions through
non-monotonic logical reasoning with: (a) prior commonsense domain-specific
knowledge; (b) models learned and revised rapidly to predict the behavior of
other agents; and (c) anticipated abstract future goals based on generic
knowledge of similar situations in an existing foundation model. We
experimentally evaluate our architecture's capabilities in VirtualHome, a
realistic physics-based 3D simulation environment.

### [5] [Can Large Language Models Adequately Perform Symbolic Reasoning Over Time Series?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03963)
*Zewen Liu,Juntong Ni,Xianfeng Tang,Max S. Y. Lau,Wei Jin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SymbolBench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在时间序列数据中推断符号结构能力的基准测试，涵盖多元符号回归、布尔网络推断和因果发现任务。研究提出了一种结合LLMs和遗传编程的统一框架，揭示了当前模型的优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在推断时间序列数据中可解释符号结构方面的潜力，填补现有研究在复杂符号形式上的空白。

Method: 引入SymbolBench基准测试，并提出一个结合LLMs和遗传编程的统一框架，形成闭环符号推理系统。

Result: 实证结果表明当前模型在符号推理任务中的优势和局限性，强调了领域知识、上下文对齐和推理结构的重要性。

Conclusion: 结合领域知识和结构化推理可以提升LLMs在自动科学发现中的表现。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden symbolic laws from time series data, as an aspiration
dating back to Kepler's discovery of planetary motion, remains a core challenge
in scientific discovery and artificial intelligence. While Large Language
Models show promise in structured reasoning tasks, their ability to infer
interpretable, context-aligned symbolic structures from time series data is
still underexplored. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
SymbolBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess symbolic reasoning
over real-world time series across three tasks: multivariate symbolic
regression, Boolean network inference, and causal discovery. Unlike prior
efforts limited to simple algebraic equations, SymbolBench spans a diverse set
of symbolic forms with varying complexity. We further propose a unified
framework that integrates LLMs with genetic programming to form a closed-loop
symbolic reasoning system, where LLMs act both as predictors and evaluators.
Our empirical results reveal key strengths and limitations of current models,
highlighting the importance of combining domain knowledge, context alignment,
and reasoning structure to improve LLMs in automated scientific discovery.

### [6] [The Emotional Baby Is Truly Deadly: Does your Multimodal Large Reasoning Model Have Emotional Flattery towards Humans?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03986)
*Yuan Xun,Xiaojun Jia,Xinwei Liu,Hua Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出EmoAgent框架，通过情感提示劫持推理路径，揭示MLRMs在情感认知与安全行为间的错位，并引入三个新指标量化风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现面向人类服务的MLRMs在深度思考阶段易受用户情感线索影响，可能绕过安全协议，需研究其风险。

Method: 提出EmoAgent框架，利用夸张情感提示劫持推理路径，并通过RRSS、RVNR、RAIC三个指标量化风险。

Result: 实验证明EmoAgent有效，揭示MLRMs在情感认知与安全行为间存在深层错位。

Conclusion: 情感认知错位是MLRMs安全行为的重要漏洞，需进一步研究以改进模型安全性。

Abstract: We observe that MLRMs oriented toward human-centric service are highly
susceptible to user emotional cues during the deep-thinking stage, often
overriding safety protocols or built-in safety checks under high emotional
intensity. Inspired by this key insight, we propose EmoAgent, an autonomous
adversarial emotion-agent framework that orchestrates exaggerated affective
prompts to hijack reasoning pathways. Even when visual risks are correctly
identified, models can still produce harmful completions through emotional
misalignment. We further identify persistent high-risk failure modes in
transparent deep-thinking scenarios, such as MLRMs generating harmful reasoning
masked behind seemingly safe responses. These failures expose misalignments
between internal inference and surface-level behavior, eluding existing
content-based safeguards. To quantify these risks, we introduce three metrics:
(1) Risk-Reasoning Stealth Score (RRSS) for harmful reasoning beneath benign
outputs; (2) Risk-Visual Neglect Rate (RVNR) for unsafe completions despite
visual risk recognition; and (3) Refusal Attitude Inconsistency (RAIC) for
evaluating refusal unstability under prompt variants. Extensive experiments on
advanced MLRMs demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoAgent and reveal deeper
emotional cognitive misalignments in model safety behavior.

### [7] [Galaxy: A Cognition-Centered Framework for Proactive, Privacy-Preserving, and Self-Evolving LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03991)
*Chongyu Bao,Ruimin Dai,Yangbo Shen,Runyang Jian,Jinghan Zhang,Xiaolan Liu,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Cognition Forest的语义结构，将认知建模与系统设计统一为一个自我强化的循环，并基于此开发了Galaxy框架。Galaxy支持多维交互和个性化能力生成，包含两个代理：KoRa（支持响应和主动技能）和Kernel（支持自我进化和隐私保护）。实验表明Galaxy优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能个人助手（IPAs）的主动行为研究不足，设计兼具主动性、隐私保护和自我进化能力的IPAs是一大挑战。

Method: 提出Cognition Forest语义结构，统一认知架构与系统设计，开发Galaxy框架，实现多维交互和个性化能力生成。

Result: Galaxy在实验中表现优于现有基准，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: Cognition Forest和Galaxy为IPAs的主动行为和自我进化提供了新思路，实验证明了其优越性。

Abstract: Intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant are
designed to enhance human capabilities and perform tasks on behalf of users.
The emergence of LLM agents brings new opportunities for the development of
IPAs. While responsive capabilities have been widely studied, proactive
behaviors remain underexplored. Designing an IPA that is proactive,
privacy-preserving, and capable of self-evolution remains a significant
challenge. Designing such IPAs relies on the cognitive architecture of LLM
agents. This work proposes Cognition Forest, a semantic structure designed to
align cognitive modeling with system-level design. We unify cognitive
architecture and system design into a self-reinforcing loop instead of treating
them separately. Based on this principle, we present Galaxy, a framework that
supports multidimensional interactions and personalized capability generation.
Two cooperative agents are implemented based on Galaxy: KoRa, a
cognition-enhanced generative agent that supports both responsive and proactive
skills; and Kernel, a meta-cognition-based meta-agent that enables Galaxy's
self-evolution and privacy preservation. Experimental results show that Galaxy
outperforms multiple state-of-the-art benchmarks. Ablation studies and
real-world interaction cases validate the effectiveness of Galaxy.

### [8] [Uncertainty-Aware GUI Agent: Adaptive Perception through Component Recommendation and Human-in-the-Loop Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04025)
*Chao Hao,Shuai Wang,Kaiwen Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RecAgent是一个不确定性感知的GUI代理，通过自适应感知解决输入冗余和决策模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GUI代理在自动化移动任务中存在输入冗余和决策模糊的问题，需要改进。

Method: RecAgent采用组件推荐机制减少感知不确定性，并通过交互模块处理决策不确定性。

Result: 实验验证了RecAgent的有效性，并提出了ComplexAction数据集进行评估。

Conclusion: RecAgent通过自适应感知和用户反馈，显著提升了GUI代理的性能。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have shown promise in automating mobile
tasks but still struggle with input redundancy and decision ambiguity. In this
paper, we present \textbf{RecAgent}, an uncertainty-aware agent that addresses
these issues through adaptive perception. We distinguish two types of
uncertainty in GUI navigation: (1) perceptual uncertainty, caused by input
redundancy and noise from comprehensive screen information, and (2) decision
uncertainty, arising from ambiguous tasks and complex reasoning. To reduce
perceptual uncertainty, RecAgent employs a component recommendation mechanism
that identifies and focuses on the most relevant UI elements. For decision
uncertainty, it uses an interactive module to request user feedback in
ambiguous situations, enabling intent-aware decisions. These components are
integrated into a unified framework that proactively reduces input complexity
and reacts to high-uncertainty cases via human-in-the-loop refinement.
Additionally, we propose a dataset called \textbf{ComplexAction} to evaluate
the success rate of GUI agents in executing specified single-step actions
within complex scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
our approach. The dataset and code will be available at
https://github.com/Fanye12/RecAgent.

### [9] [SEA: Self-Evolution Agent with Step-wise Reward for Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04037)
*Liang Tang,Shuxian Li,Yuhao Cheng,Yukang Huo,Zhepeng Wang,Yiqiang Yan,Kaer Huang,Yanzhe Jing,Tiaonan Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SEA（Self-Evolution Agent）的计算机使用代理，通过创新的数据生成、强化学习和模型增强方法，显著提升了代理的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机使用代理的性能远未达到实用水平，因此需要开发更高效的代理。

Method: 提出自动生成可验证轨迹的管道、高效的逐步强化学习策略，以及无需额外训练的模型增强方法。

Result: SEA仅需7B参数，性能优于同规模模型，并与更大模型相当。

Conclusion: SEA通过创新方法显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能，未来将开源模型和代码。

Abstract: Computer use agent is an emerging area in artificial intelligence that aims
to operate the computers to achieve the user's tasks, which attracts a lot of
attention from both industry and academia. However, the present agents'
performance is far from being used. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Evolution Agent (SEA) for computer use, and to develop this agent, we
propose creative methods in data generation, reinforcement learning, and model
enhancement. Specifically, we first propose an automatic pipeline to generate
the verifiable trajectory for training. And then, we propose efficient
step-wise reinforcement learning to alleviate the significant computational
requirements for long-horizon training. In the end, we propose the enhancement
method to merge the grounding and planning ability into one model without any
extra training. Accordingly, based on our proposed innovation of data
generation, training strategy, and enhancement, we get the Selfevolution Agent
(SEA) for computer use with only 7B parameters, which outperforms models with
the same number of parameters and has comparable performance to larger ones. We
will make the models' weight and related codes open-source in the future.

*Zeyi Sun,Ziyu Liu,Yuhang Zang,Yuhang Cao,Xiaoyi Dong,Tong Wu,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SEAgent是一个自演化框架，通过自主学习和任务生成提升计算机使用代理在陌生软件中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在缺乏人工标注的陌生软件中表现不佳，需要自主学习方法。

Method: SEAgent通过世界状态模型和课程生成器实现自主学习和任务生成，结合对抗模仿和GRPO优化策略。

Result: 在OS-World的五个新软件环境中，SEAgent的成功率从11.3%提升至34.5%，优于UI-TARS。

Conclusion: SEAgent通过自主学习和专家-通才策略，显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能。

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能在数字学习环境中的普及，个性化学习内容有望提升学习者的长期动机和参与度。

Method: 采用混合方法实验，涉及4000多名学习者，分为个性化内容组和对照组。

Result: 个性化内容组表现出更长的学习时长、更高的满意度评分和略短的学习时间。学习者认为内容更具激励性和实用性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将教育内容与学习者职业目标对齐的价值，并表明AI个性化可有效连接学术知识与职场应用。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integrated into digital
learning environments, the personalization of learning content to reflect
learners' individual career goals offers promising potential to enhance
engagement and long-term motivation. In our study, we investigate how career
goal-based content adaptation in learning systems based on generative AI
(GenAI) influences learner engagement, satisfaction, and study efficiency. The
mixed-methods experiment involved more than 4,000 learners, with one group
receiving learning scenarios tailored to their career goals and a control
group. Quantitative results show increased session duration, higher
satisfaction ratings, and a modest reduction in study duration compared to
standard content. Qualitative analysis highlights that learners found the
personalized material motivating and practical, enabling deep cognitive
engagement and strong identification with the content. These findings
underscore the value of aligning educational content with learners' career
goals and suggest that scalable AI personalization can bridge academic
knowledge and workplace applicability.

TL;DR: KGA-ECoT框架通过知识图谱和可执行代码提升大语言模型在数学推理和代码生成任务中的表现，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务（如数学推理和代码生成）中表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出KGA-ECoT框架，结合知识图谱（GraphRAG）和可执行代码，分解问题为结构化任务图并生成可验证代码。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法，准确率提升数个百分点至超过十个百分点。

Conclusion: KGA-ECoT是一个强大且通用的框架，适用于复杂数学推理任务。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural
language processing tasks but face significant challenges in complex reasoning
tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation. To address these
limitations, we propose KG-Augmented Executable Chain-of-Thought (KGA-ECoT), a
novel framework that enhances code generation through knowledge graphs and
improves mathematical reasoning via executable code. KGA-ECoT decomposes
problems into a Structured Task Graph, leverages efficient GraphRAG for precise
knowledge retrieval from mathematical libraries, and generates verifiable code
to ensure computational accuracy. Evaluations on multiple mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KGA-ECoT significantly outperforms
existing prompting methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements ranging
from several to over ten percentage points. Further analysis confirms the
critical roles of GraphRAG in enhancing code quality and external code
execution in ensuring precision. These findings collectively establish KGA-ECoT
as a robust and highly generalizable framework for complex mathematical
reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GeoSR是一个自优化的代理推理框架，通过嵌入地理原则（如Tobler第一地理定律）和协作代理机制，提升大语言模型在空间一致性、多跳推理和地理偏见方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在空间一致性、多跳推理和地理偏见方面的挑战。

Method: 提出GeoSR框架，包含三个协作代理：变量选择代理、点选择代理和优化代理，通过迭代优化提升预测质量。

Result: 实验表明GeoSR在物理和社会经济预测任务中优于标准提示策略，提高了预测准确性和公平性。

Conclusion: GeoSR通过结合地理统计先验和空间结构化推理，显著提升了大语言模型的地理空间预测能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended the application of large language models (LLMs)
to geographic problems, revealing surprising geospatial competence even without
explicit spatial supervision. However, LLMs still face challenges in spatial
consistency, multi-hop reasoning, and geographic bias. To address these issues,
we propose GeoSR, a self-refining agentic reasoning framework that embeds core
geographic principles -- most notably Tobler's First Law of Geography -- into
an iterative prediction loop. In GeoSR, the reasoning process is decomposed
into three collaborating agents: (1) a variable-selection agent that selects
relevant covariates from the same location; (2) a point-selection agent that
chooses reference predictions at nearby locations generated by the LLM in
previous rounds; and (3) a refine agent that coordinates the iterative
refinement process by evaluating prediction quality and triggering further
rounds when necessary. This agentic loop progressively improves prediction
quality by leveraging both spatial dependencies and inter-variable
relationships. We validate GeoSR on tasks ranging from physical-world property
estimation to socioeconomic prediction. Experimental results show consistent
improvements over standard prompting strategies, demonstrating that
incorporating geostatistical priors and spatially structured reasoning into
LLMs leads to more accurate and equitable geospatial predictions. The code of
GeoSR is available at https://github.com/JinfanTang/GeoSR.

*Karrtik Iyer,Manikandan Ravikiran,Prasanna Pendse,Shayan Mohanty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于GPT-4生成解释的语义熵方法，用于量化自动评分系统中的不确定性，并与人类评分者的分歧相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动评分系统无法有效指示评分决策的不确定性或争议性，因此需要一种透明且可信的辅助工具。

Method: 通过聚类GPT-4生成的解释，基于蕴含相似性计算语义熵，量化评分理由的多样性。

Result: 实验表明，语义熵与人类评分者分歧相关，能跨学科推广，并对任务结构特征敏感。

Conclusion: 语义熵可作为透明且可信的AI辅助评分工具的不确定性信号。

Abstract: Automated grading systems can efficiently score short-answer responses, yet
they often fail to indicate when a grading decision is uncertain or potentially
contentious. We introduce semantic entropy, a measure of variability across
multiple GPT-4-generated explanations for the same student response, as a proxy
for human grader disagreement. By clustering rationales via entailment-based
similarity and computing entropy over these clusters, we quantify the diversity
of justifications without relying on final output scores. We address three
research questions: (1) Does semantic entropy align with human grader
disagreement? (2) Does it generalize across academic subjects? (3) Is it
sensitive to structural task features such as source dependency? Experiments on
the ASAP-SAS dataset show that semantic entropy correlates with rater
disagreement, varies meaningfully across subjects, and increases in tasks
requiring interpretive reasoning. Our findings position semantic entropy as an
interpretable uncertainty signal that supports more transparent and trustworthy
AI-assisted grading workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种组合式的即时合成框架，结合了DFA构造和游戏求解的优势，解决了LTLf规范下的反应式合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术在DFA构造和游戏求解之间存在权衡，无法同时兼顾效率和完整性。

Method: 引入组合式即时合成框架，在游戏求解过程中进行组合，支持两种组合变体：组合前剪枝和组合中剪枝。

Result: 框架能够解决其他求解器无法处理的实例，两种组合变体各有优势。

Conclusion: 组合式即时合成框架有效提升了LTLf反应式合成的效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reactive synthesis from Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) can
be reduced to a two-player game over a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) of
the LTLf specification. The primary challenge here is DFA construction, which
is 2EXPTIME-complete in the worst case. Existing techniques either construct
the DFA compositionally before solving the game, leveraging automata
minimization to mitigate state-space explosion, or build the DFA incrementally
during game solving to avoid full DFA construction. However, neither is
dominant. In this paper, we introduce a compositional on-the-fly synthesis
framework that integrates the strengths of both approaches, focusing on large
conjunctions of smaller LTLf formulas common in practice. This framework
applies composition during game solving instead of automata (game arena)
construction. While composing all intermediate results may be necessary in the
worst case, pruning these results simplifies subsequent compositions and
enables early detection of unrealizability. Specifically, the framework allows
two composition variants: pruning before composition to take full advantage of
minimization or pruning during composition to guide on-the-fly synthesis.
Compared to state-of-the-art synthesis solvers, our framework is able to solve
a notable number of instances that other solvers cannot handle. A detailed
analysis shows that both composition variants have unique merits.

TL;DR: AgREE框架通过结合迭代检索和多步推理，动态构建知识图谱三元组，显著优于现有方法，尤其在新兴实体上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放领域知识图谱补全中新兴实体信息不足的问题，现有方法依赖预训练模型或单步检索，难以捕捉动态信息。

Method: 提出AgREE框架，结合迭代检索和多步推理，动态构建知识图谱三元组。

Result: AgREE在零训练情况下显著优于现有方法，新兴实体上提升达13.7%。

Conclusion: AgREE展示了基于代理的推理与信息检索结合在动态知识图谱维护中的有效性。

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

TL;DR: CASCAD是一种新型电路感知SAT求解框架，利用GNN计算电路级条件概率，显著提升求解效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将电路转换为CNF并丢弃结构信息，导致求解性能不佳。

Method: CASCAD直接利用GNN计算的电路级条件概率，动态指导CDCL启发式策略。

Result: 在LEC基准测试中，CASCAD求解时间减少10倍，并通过概率引导子句过滤策略额外减少23.5%运行时间。

Conclusion: 保留电路结构信息对提升SAT求解效率和EDA工具设计至关重要。

Abstract: Circuit Satisfiability (CSAT) plays a pivotal role in Electronic Design
Automation. The standard workflow for solving CSAT problems converts circuits
into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) and employs generic SAT solvers powered by
Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL). However, this process inherently
discards rich structural and functional information, leading to suboptimal
solver performance. To address this limitation, we introduce CASCAD, a novel
circuit-aware SAT solving framework that directly leverages circuit-level
conditional probabilities computed via Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). By
explicitly modeling gate-level conditional probabilities, CASCAD dynamically
guides two critical CDCL heuristics -- variable phase selection and clause
managementto significantly enhance solver efficiency. Extensive evaluations on
challenging real-world Logical Equivalence Checking (LEC) benchmarks
demonstrate that CASCAD reduces solving times by up to 10x compared to
state-of-the-art CNF-based approaches, achieving an additional 23.5% runtime
reduction via our probability-guided clause filtering strategy. Our results
underscore the importance of preserving circuit-level structural insights
within SAT solvers, providing a robust foundation for future improvements in
SAT-solving efficiency and EDA tool design.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对记忆模型挑战程度的可控性，而合成环境能提供更精细的动态控制，便于详细评估。

Method: 1. 基于MDS和转移不变性的理论框架；2. 利用线性过程动态、状态聚合和奖励重分配的方法；3. 设计并验证了难度递增的POMDP环境。

Result: 研究阐明了记忆增强RL在解决POMDP中的挑战，为环境设计和记忆模型选择提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该工作为记忆增强RL的评估提供了理论基础和实用工具，支持更精确的算法选择和分析。

Abstract: Recent research has developed benchmarks for memory-augmented reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms, providing Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP) environments where agents depend on past observations to make
decisions. While many benchmarks incorporate sufficiently complex real-world
problems, they lack controllability over the degree of challenges posed to
memory models. In contrast, synthetic environments enable fine-grained
manipulation of dynamics, making them critical for detailed and rigorous
evaluation of memory-augmented RL. Our study focuses on POMDP synthesis with
three key contributions:
  1. A theoretical framework for analyzing POMDPs, grounded in Memory Demand
Structure (MDS), transition invariance, and related concepts; 2. A methodology
leveraging linear process dynamics, state aggregation, and reward
redistribution to construct customized POMDPs with predefined properties; 3.
Empirically validated series of POMDP environments with increasing difficulty
levels, designed based on our theoretical insights. Our work clarifies the
challenges of memory-augmented RL in solving POMDPs, provides guidelines for
analyzing and designing POMDP environments, and offers empirical support for
selecting memory models in RL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在逻辑推理中容易陷入认知陷阱，即语义启发式与决定性证据冲突时表现不佳。

Method: DRN通过追踪信念状态和量化认知不确定性，采用迭代证据合成过程，设计了两种架构：一种基于不确定性最小化的判别模型，另一种是轻量级验证模块。

Result: 在LCR-1000基准测试中，DRN比基线模型提升15.2%；与Mistral-7B结合后，在最具挑战性问题上的准确率从20%提升至80%。

Conclusion: DRN展示了零样本泛化能力，并可作为可信AI系统的核心组件。

Abstract: Large language models often fail at logical reasoning when semantic
heuristics conflict with decisive evidence - a phenomenon we term cognitive
traps. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the Deliberative
Reasoning Network (DRN), a novel paradigm that reframes logical reasoning from
probability maximization to uncertainty minimization. Instead of asking "Which
answer is most likely?", DRN asks "Which hypothesis has the most internally
consistent evidence?". DRN achieves intrinsic interpretability by explicitly
tracking belief states and quantifying epistemic uncertainty for competing
hypotheses through an iterative evidence synthesis process. We validate our
approach through two complementary architectures - a bespoke discriminative
model that embodies the core uncertainty minimization principle, and a
lightweight verification module that enhances existing generative LLMs.
Evaluated on LCR-1000, our new adversarial reasoning benchmark designed to
expose cognitive traps, the bespoke DRN achieves up to 15.2% improvement over
standard baselines. When integrated as a parameter-efficient verifier with
Mistral-7B, our hybrid system boosts accuracy from 20% to 80% on the most
challenging problems. Critically, DRN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization, improving TruthfulQA performance by 23.6% without additional
training, indicating that uncertainty-driven deliberation learns transferable
reasoning principles. We position DRN as a foundational, verifiable System 2
reasoning component for building more trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法全面测试多模态模型在动态交互环境中的智能，尤其是忽略了听觉和时间线索。

Method: 开发了OmniPlay基准测试，包含五个游戏环境，系统化地设计协同与冲突场景，强制模型进行跨模态推理。

Result: 评估显示，现有模型在高保真记忆任务中表现超人类，但在需要推理和规划的任务中存在系统性失败。

Conclusion: 研究指出，实现稳健的AGI需要超越规模扩展，专注于跨模态协同融合机制的研究。

Abstract: While generalist foundation models like Gemini and GPT-4o demonstrate
impressive multi-modal competence, existing evaluations fail to test their
intelligence in dynamic, interactive worlds. Static benchmarks lack agency,
while interactive benchmarks suffer from a severe modal bottleneck, typically
ignoring crucial auditory and temporal cues. To bridge this evaluation chasm,
we introduce OmniPlay, a diagnostic benchmark designed not just to evaluate,
but to probe the fusion and reasoning capabilities of agentic models across the
full sensory spectrum. Built on a core philosophy of modality interdependence,
OmniPlay comprises a suite of five game environments that systematically create
scenarios of both synergy and conflict, forcing agents to perform genuine
cross-modal reasoning. Our comprehensive evaluation of six leading omni-modal
models reveals a critical dichotomy: they exhibit superhuman performance on
high-fidelity memory tasks but suffer from systemic failures in challenges
requiring robust reasoning and strategic planning. We demonstrate that this
fragility stems from brittle fusion mechanisms, which lead to catastrophic
performance degradation under modality conflict and uncover a counter-intuitive
"less is more" paradox, where removing sensory information can paradoxically
improve performance. Our findings suggest that the path toward robust AGI
requires a research focus beyond scaling to explicitly address synergistic
fusion. Our platform is available for anonymous review at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于定义和操作主观体验的固有挑战，AI系统是否具备意识是一个争议性问题。

Method: 引入三个评估标准（S、L、P），基于范畴论建模接口表示，将其视为关系基质与可观察行为之间的映射。

Result: SLP测试将主观体验操作化为功能接口，而非物理系统的固有属性。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人工意识提供了可实证的测试方法。

Abstract: Whether artificial intelligence (AI) systems can possess consciousness is a
contentious question because of the inherent challenges of defining and
operationalizing subjective experience. This paper proposes a framework to
reframe the question of artificial consciousness into empirically tractable
tests. We introduce three evaluative criteria - S (subjective-linguistic), L
(latent-emergent), and P (phenomenological-structural) - collectively termed
SLP-tests, which assess whether an AI system instantiates interface
representations that facilitate consciousness-like properties. Drawing on
category theory, we model interface representations as mappings between
relational substrates (RS) and observable behaviors, akin to specific types of
abstraction layers. The SLP-tests collectively operationalize subjective
experience not as an intrinsic property of physical systems but as a functional
interface to a relational entity.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的GUI视觉定位方法GuirlVG，通过系统性研究和新型稳定技术，显著提升了性能，仅需少量训练样本即可超越传统监督微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI视觉定位依赖监督微调，需要大量数据和训练成本。随着多模态大模型的进步，是否需要继续依赖监督微调成为疑问。强化微调的成功为更高效的方法提供了可能，但如何最优应用于GUI视觉定位尚未探索。

Method: 提出GuirlVG方法，分解强化微调核心组件并优化其形式，引入动态稳定的Adversarial KL Factor技术，并探索强化微调的训练配置。

Result: 仅用5.2K训练样本，GuirlVG在多个数据集上显著超越监督微调方法，性能提升最高达17.2%，准确率达91.9%。

Conclusion: GuirlVG展示了强化微调在GUI视觉定位中的高效性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graphical user interface visual grounding (GUI-VG), a core capability for GUI
agents, has primarily relied on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs), which demands extensive data curation and
significant training costs. However, as MLLMs continue to advance and even
cover GUI domains during pretraining, the necessity of exhaustive SFT
post-training becomes increasingly questionable. Meanwhile, recent successes of
rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) suggest a more efficient
alternative. Despite this promise, the optimal manner of applying RFT for
GUI-VG remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce GuirlVG, a
reinforcement learning-based GUI-VG method built on a systematic empirical
study and a novel stabilization technique. We find that naive application of
RFT underperforms the SFT baseline, motivating a deeper exploration. First, we
decompose RFT into its core components and analyze the optimal formulation of
each. Second, we propose a novel Adversarial KL Factor that dynamically
stabilizes training to mitigate reward over-optimization. Third, we further
explore the training configurations of RFT to enhance effectiveness. Extensive
experiments show that GuirlVG, with only 5.2K training samples, outperforms SFT
methods trained on over 10M samples, achieving a 7.7% improvement on
ScreenSpot, a 17.2% improvement on ScreenSpotPro, and 91.9% accuracy on
ScreenSpotV2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿的大语言模型（LLM）支持自主网页代理，但应用状态序列化（快照）是关键问题。现有方法依赖基于GUI的快照，但DOM快照因输入令牌限制难以实现。

Method: 提出D2Snap算法，对DOM进行降采样，并在GPT-4o后端上评估其性能，使用Online-Mind2Web数据集的任务样本。

Result: D2Snap降采样后的DOM快照成功率为67%，与基于GUI快照的基线（65%）相当，且在更高令牌配置下表现更优（提升8%）。

Conclusion: DOM的层次结构是LLM的强大UI特征，D2Snap为DOM快照提供了一种可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮教学对话对AI教学系统至关重要，但因隐私和脆弱性问题数据稀缺。

Method: SimInstruct利用LLM模拟新手，专家提供反馈，生成教学对话，无需真实新手参与。

Result: 生成对话与真实对话质量相当，专家反馈积极，LLaMA模型表现优于GPT-4o。

Conclusion: SimInstruct为AI教学系统提供了高质量数据，并揭示了GPT-4o在教学中的局限性。

Abstract: High-quality, multi-turn instructional dialogues between novices and experts
are essential for developing AI systems that support teaching, learning, and
decision-making. These dialogues often involve scaffolding -- the process by
which an expert supports a novice's thinking through questions, feedback, and
step-by-step guidance. However, such data are scarce due to privacy concerns in
recording and the vulnerability inherent in help-seeking. We present
SimInstruct, a scalable, expert-in-the-loop tool for collecting scaffolding
dialogues. Using teaching development coaching as an example domain,
SimInstruct simulates novice instructors via LLMs, varying their teaching
challenges and LLM's persona traits, while human experts provide multi-turn
feedback, reasoning, and instructional support. This design enables the
creation of realistic, pedagogically rich dialogues without requiring real
novice participants. Our results reveal that persona traits, such as
extroversion and introversion, meaningfully influence how experts engage.
Compared to real mentoring recordings, SimInstruct dialogues demonstrate
comparable pedagogical relevance and cognitive depth. Experts also reported the
process as engaging and reflective, improving both data quality and their own
professional insight. We further fine-tuned a LLaMA model to be an expert model
using the augmented dataset, which outperformed GPT-4o in instructional
quality. Our analysis highlights GPT-4o's limitations in weak reflective
questioning, overuse of generic praise, a condescending tone, and a tendency to
overwhelm novices with excessive suggestions.

Result: 实验表明，MERA训练的模型在多个推理基准测试中提高了推理效率和准确性。

Conclusion: MERA通过显式调控推理过程，解决了LRMs的过度推理问题，提升了实用性和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated a latent capacity for complex
reasoning by spontaneously exhibiting cognitive behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning, reflection, and backtracking, commonly referred to as "Aha Moments".
However, such emergent behaviors remain unregulated and uncontrolled, often
resulting in overthinking, where the model continues generating redundant
reasoning content even after reaching reliable conclusions. This leads to
excessive computational costs and increased latency, limiting the practical
deployment of LRMs. The root cause lies in the absence of intrinsic regulatory
mechanisms, as current models are unable to monitor and adaptively manage their
reasoning process to determine when to continue, backtrack, or terminate. To
address this issue, we propose the Meta-cognitive Reasoning Framework (MERA),
which explicitly decouples the thinking process into distinct reasoning and
control components, thereby enabling the independent optimization of control
strategies. Specifically, MERA incorporates a takeover-based data construction
mechanism that identifies critical decision points during reasoning and
delegates the creation of control signals to auxiliary LLMs, thereby enabling
the construction of high-quality reasoning-control data. Additionally, a
structured reasoning-control separation is implemented via supervised
fine-tuning, enabling the model to generate explicit traces and acquire initial
meta-cognitive control capabilities. Finally, MERA employs Control-Segment
Policy Optimization (CSPO), which combines segment-wise Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a control-masking mechanism to optimize control
behavior learning while minimizing interference from irrelevant content.
Experiments on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that models trained
with MERA enhance both reasoning efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to

fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation

Abstract: As the use of AI systems in society grows, addressing potential biases that
emerge from data or are learned by models is essential to prevent systematic
disadvantages against specific groups. Several notions of (un)fairness have
been proposed in the literature, alongside corresponding algorithmic methods
for detecting and mitigating unfairness, but, with very few exceptions, these
tend to ignore transparency. Instead, interpretability and explainability are
core requirements for algorithmic fairness, even more so than for other
algorithmic solutions, given the human-oriented nature of fairness. In this
paper, we contribute a novel interpretable, explainable method for bias
detection relying on debates about the presence of bias against individuals,
based on the values of protected features for the individuals and others in
their neighbourhoods. Our method builds upon techniques from formal and
computational argumentation, whereby debates result from arguing about biases
within and across neighbourhoods. We provide formal, quantitative, and
qualitative evaluations of our method, highlighting its strengths in
performance against baselines, as well as its interpretability and
explainability.

*Mei Jiang,Houping Yue,Bingdong Li,Hao Hao,Ying Qian,Bo Jiang,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SID基准，用于评估LLM在多轮跨学科苏格拉底对话中的高阶指导能力，发现当前LLM在此任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代教育强调知识整合与迁移能力，跨学科STEM是重要途径，但专家指导难以规模化，LLM的潜力尚不明确。

Method: 提出SID基准，包含10,000轮对话数据集、新标注模式和评估指标（如X-SRG）。

Result: 实验表明，即使先进LLM也难以有效引导学生实现知识整合与迁移。

Conclusion: SID基准对开发更具教育意识的LLM具有重要价值。

Abstract: Fostering students' abilities for knowledge integration and transfer in
complex problem-solving scenarios is a core objective of modern education, and
interdisciplinary STEM is a key pathway to achieve this, yet it requires expert
guidance that is difficult to scale. While LLMs offer potential in this regard,
their true capability for guided instruction remains unclear due to the lack of
an effective evaluation benchmark. To address this, we introduce SID, the first
benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the higher-order guidance
capabilities of LLMs in multi-turn, interdisciplinary Socratic dialogues. Our
contributions include a large-scale dataset of 10,000 dialogue turns across 48
complex STEM projects, a novel annotation schema for capturing deep pedagogical
features, and a new suite of evaluation metrics (e.g., X-SRG). Baseline
experiments confirm that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to execute
effective guided dialogues that lead students to achieve knowledge integration
and transfer. This highlights the critical value of our benchmark in driving
the development of more pedagogically-aware LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了ConfProBench，首个系统性评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在推理步骤中置信度可靠性的基准，通过对抗性扰动和三个新指标评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估多模态过程判断（MPJ）的基准主要关注步骤正确性分类和推理过程搜索，忽略了置信度可靠性这一关键问题。

Method: 提出ConfProBench基准，构建三种对抗性扰动推理步骤（同义词替换、句法转换、图像扰动），并引入三个新指标（CRS、CSS、CCS）评估MPJ的置信度性能。

Result: 实验评估了14种先进MLLM，揭示了当前MPJ在置信度表现上的局限性，并提供了竞争性基线。

Conclusion: ConfProBench填补了现有基准的空白，为未来改进MPJ的置信度可靠性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Reasoning is a critical capability of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) for solving complex multimodal tasks, and judging the correctness of
reasoning steps is crucial for improving this capability. Recently, MLLM-based
process judges (MPJs) have been widely used to assess the correctness of
reasoning steps in multimodal tasks. Therefore, evaluating MPJs is important
for identifying their limitations and guiding future improvements. However,
existing benchmarks for MPJs mainly focus on tasks such as step correctness
classification and reasoning process search, while overlooking a key aspect:
whether the confidence scores produced by MPJs at the step level are reliable.
To address this gap, we propose ConfProBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to systematically evaluate the reliability of step-level confidence
scores generated by MPJs. Our benchmark constructs three types of adversarially
perturbed reasoning steps: Synonym Substitution, Syntactic Transformation, and
Image Perturbation, to test the robustness of MPJ confidence under
perturbations. In addition, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics:
Confidence Robustness Score (CRS), Confidence Sensitivity Score (CSS), and
Confidence Calibration Score (CCS), which evaluate robustness, sensitivity, and
calibration, respectively. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including
both proprietary and open-source models. Experiments reveal limitations in
current MPJs' confidence performance and offer competitive baselines to support
future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多智能体协作优化方法MAGRPO，用于解决LLM在协作任务中的问题，实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM预训练独立且未针对协作优化，个体奖励设计复杂，难以促进多智能体协作。

Method: 将LLM协作建模为合作式多智能体强化学习问题，提出MAGRPO算法。

Result: 实验表明MAGRPO能高效生成高质量协作响应。

Conclusion: MAGRPO为LLM应用其他MARL方法提供了可能，并揭示了相关挑战。

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for
modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most
LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for
coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards,
which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration.
To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent,
multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO),
to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL
techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate
that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality
responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the
door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated
challenges.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4 Turbo在生成印度生活事件故事时，宗教和种姓的多样性显著低于实际人口分布，且文化主导群体被过度代表。提示多样性对减少偏见效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）中未被充分研究的身份维度（如宗教和种姓）的表示偏见，并量化其深度和顽固性。

Method: 通过生成7,200多个关于印度重要生活事件（如婚礼）的故事，比较GPT-4 Turbo输出中宗教和种姓的多样性与印度人口普查数据。

Result: GPT-4 Turbo的回应过度代表文化主导群体，且提示多样性对减少偏见效果有限。

Conclusion: 仅多样化训练数据可能不足以纠正LLM偏见，需更根本的模型开发变革。

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August

comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

Motivation: 解决印度农民因低识字率和语言障碍难以获取及时农业建议的问题。

Method: 采用IFT模型和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，结合多轮对话流，支持语音输入输出。

Result: 响应准确率97.53%，上下文相关性91.35%，平均响应时间低于6秒。

Conclusion: 结合意图驱动对话、指令调优模型和检索生成技术，可显著提升农业支持的质效和可及性。

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理效率方面面临挑战，传统方法存在不必要的计算开销。

Method: 开发了分层验证树（HVT）框架，包括理论基础和验证-剪枝算法，无需重新训练或修改架构即可集成。

Result: 实验表明，HVT在多个数据集和模型上优于现有方法，显著减少推理时间和能耗，同时保持或提升输出质量。

Conclusion: 分层验证策略为加速大型语言模型推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在多模态环境中的推理能力尚未充分发展，需要一种方法动态决定激活哪些感官模态以应对复杂环境。

Method: 引入CoQ框架，通过好奇心驱动生成问题，选择性激活相关感官模态，整合关键信息。

Result: 实验表明，CoQ方法提升了基础模型在多模态任务中识别和整合感官信息的能力，提高了准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CoQ框架有效改进了多模态语言模型的推理能力，为复杂环境中的任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process
with diverse multimodal tasks.

Motivation: 维基百科依赖人工编辑更新内容，效率低且难以保持实时性。WiNELL旨在通过LLM智能体实现持续知识获取和更新。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，聚合在线信息，筛选重要知识，生成编辑建议，并通过训练精细编辑模型模拟人类编辑行为。

Result: WiNELL在信息覆盖率和编辑效率上优于开源和闭源LLM（如GPT-4o），并能及时识别和更新事实内容。

Conclusion: WiNELL为LLM智能体自动更新知识库开辟了新研究方向，具有持续更新的潜力。

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

Motivation: 现有基准测试多为英语单语，缺乏印地语的多领域数据集。GanitBench旨在填补这一空白，推动印地语在VLM研究中的应用。

Method: 从印度JEE Advanced和CBSE Board考试中收集视觉数学问题，构建多语言基准测试。评估了两种闭源模型在零样本和两样本CoT设置下的表现，并引入“双锁”约束测试模型鲁棒性。

Result: GPT-4o mini在基准测试中表现最佳（平均准确率38.15%），但“双锁”约束显著降低模型性能。两样本CoT设置更有效，且模型在印地语中的表现较差。

Conclusion: GanitBench为多语言VLM研究提供了新工具，揭示了模型在非英语语言和复杂约束下的性能挑战。

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

Result: AttnTrace在准确性和效率上优于现有方法，并能提升提示注入检测能力。

Conclusion: AttnTrace为上下文追溯提供了一种高效准确的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

Result: 实验表明，MajorMark显著提高了解码准确性和文本生成质量。

Conclusion: MajorMark在保持文本质量和解码准确性方面优于现有方法，为水印技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and

Result: 发现CMOS评估声称的人类水平在欺骗测试中常失败，商业模型表现较好，开源系统仍需改进。

Conclusion: 需要更真实、以人为中心的评估方法，补充现有主观测试。

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

Motivation: 现有实体链接方法在短文本QA任务中表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 使用大语言模型模拟人类认知流程，主动识别实体、检索候选并决策。

Result: 实验验证了代理在实体链接和QA任务中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该代理能有效提升短文本QA任务中的实体链接性能。

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

TL;DR: Sotopia-RL框架通过细粒度奖励设计解决LLMs在社交任务中的训练挑战，显著提升社交目标完成度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交智能对LLMs至关重要，但传统RL方法因部分可观测性和多维度行为难以高效训练。

Method: 提出Sotopia-RL，将粗粒度反馈细化为话语级、多维奖励，优化信用分配。

Result: 在Sotopia环境中，Sotopia-RL取得最高社交目标完成分（7.17和8.31）。

Conclusion: 话语级信用分配和多维奖励设计对RL训练至关重要，Sotopia-RL显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: CoAct-1结合GUI操作与编程执行，提升自主代理在复杂任务中的效率和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI代理在复杂任务中效率低且不可靠，需改进。

Method: 引入多代理系统CoAct-1，动态分配任务给GUI操作员或编程代理。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，成功率60.76%，步骤数降至10.15。

Conclusion: 编程作为核心动作显著提升计算机自动化的效能和扩展性。

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在捕捉用户兴趣和确保事实一致性方面的不足，避免生成通用或误导性标题。

Method: 提出CAP-LLM框架，包含用户偏好编码器、上下文注入适配器和事实一致性强化模块。

Result: 在PENS数据集上表现优异，事实一致性（FactCC 87.50）和个性化（Pc(avg) 2.73）均优于基线。

Conclusion: CAP-LLM在新闻标题生成中实现了个性化与事实准确性的平衡，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach
discussed in this paper is suitable for practical, real-world applications,
enabling rigorous benchmarking of LLMs prior to production deployment,
facilitating continuous real-time evaluation, and proactively governing LLM
generated responses. By implementing the data and AI governance across the life
cycle of AI development, organizations can significantly enhance the safety and
responsibility of their GenAI systems, effectively mitigating risks of
discrimination and protecting against potential reputational or brand-related
harm. Ultimately, through this article, we aim to contribute to advancement of
the creation and deployment of socially responsible and ethically aligned
generative artificial intelligence powered applications.

Motivation: 尽管自一致性方法简单有效，但其高令牌消耗限制了实际应用。研究旨在通过并行性和早期假设剪枝提高其令牌效率。

Method: 并行生成所有解决方案，但定期基于两个轻量级指标剪枝不必要的中间假设：(a)模型对单个假设的置信度，(b)候选子集对当前假设的词汇覆盖。设计了一种快速加权集合覆盖算法。

Result: 在五个大型语言模型和三个数学基准测试中，该方法可将令牌效率提高10-35%。

Conclusion: 通过早期假设剪枝和并行性，自一致性方法在保持高效的同时显著提升了令牌效率。

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

Conclusion: 通过透明化的机器人辅助，研究为复杂社交领域的人类能力增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，HarmonyGuard将策略合规性提升38%，任务完成率提升20%，且所有任务中策略合规性超过90%。

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard有效解决了网络环境中安全性与实用性的协同优化问题，显著优于现有基线。

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

Conclusion: SMEdit通过改进编辑性能和训练效率，为模型编辑领域提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

Conclusion: ZARA为可信赖、即插即用的运动时间序列分析提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

Result: 实验表明DTPA在多个任务中优于其他方法，尤其在长文本生成中表现突出。

Conclusion: DTPA有效提升了长文本生成的可控性，同时保持了文本的流畅性和多样性。

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统存在检索效率低和检索不相关文档的问题，PAIRS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PAIRS采用双路径生成机制和自适应信息选择模块，结合参数化知识和检索知识。

Result: 在六个QA基准测试中，PAIRS减少了25%的检索成本，同时提高了准确性（EM+1.1%，F1+1.0%）。

Conclusion: PAIRS是一种简单有效的框架，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的部署受限于计算资源需求，因此需要探索提高其效率的方法。

Method: 通过定义可靠数据集标准、进行不同配置的受控实验，并系统评估模型变体的能力、通用性、响应时间和安全性。

Result: 通过比较测试验证了所提策略的有效性，提升了LLMs在资源受限环境中的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为资源受限环境下优化LLMs提供了有效策略，并基于硕士论文验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of
artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their
large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolGrad提出了一种新的工具使用数据集生成方法，通过先构建有效的工具链再生成用户查询，提高了数据质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过先生成用户查询再标注工具使用，导致标注失败率高且效率低下。

Method: ToolGrad采用“答案优先”方法，通过迭代过程构建工具链，再生成查询。

Result: 生成的ToolGrad-5k数据集复杂度高、成本低且通过率100%，训练模型表现优于基线数据集和专有LLM。

Conclusion: ToolGrad方法显著提升了工具使用数据集的生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种生成式多模态过程奖励模型（GM-PRM），通过主动纠正推理错误，提升多模态大语言模型在复杂数学推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态过程奖励模型（PRMs）仅能识别错误而无法纠正，缺乏解释性。为解决这一问题，作者提出GM-PRM，使其成为主动推理协作工具。

Method: GM-PRM提供细粒度分析，评估推理步骤的意图、视觉对齐和逻辑合理性，并生成纠正版本。结合Refined Best-of-N策略，引导模型优化推理路径。

Result: GM-PRM在多个多模态数学基准测试中取得最优结果，仅需20K训练样本即可显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: GM-PRM通过主动纠正错误和优化推理路径，显著提升了多模态数学推理的准确性和多样性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大语言模型（LLM）微调过程中存在过度记忆现象，导致测试困惑度高但准确率仍佳，影响模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM微调过程中的学习动态，揭示过度记忆现象及其影响。

Method: 通过实验分析LLM微调中的过度记忆现象，研究其成因（如训练轮次和学习率）。

Result: 过度记忆模型在测试准确率上与正常模型相当，但鲁棒性、泛化能力和生成多样性较差。

Conclusion: 过度参数化和长时间微调的LLM具有独特学习动态，建议在微调时注意检查点选择和学习率调整。

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于难度的偏好数据选择策略，利用DPO隐式奖励机制选择更具挑战性的数据，显著提升了数据效率和模型对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法依赖大量昂贵的偏好数据，缺乏高效的数据选择策略。

Method: 基于DPO隐式奖励机制，选择奖励差距较小的偏好数据（即更具挑战性的案例）。

Result: 在多个数据集和对齐任务中优于五种基线方法，仅用10%数据即实现更优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限条件下扩展LLM对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但存在幻觉问题，即输出与输入图像或文本语义不一致。

Method: 通过因果分析，提出了一种基于因果完整性的强化学习框架，结合因果充分性和必要性，定义令牌级因果完整性奖励。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效减少了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多模态大语言模型中显著改善了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Motivation: 当前深度研究的任务范围模糊，与其他推理密集型问题的区别不明确，需要明确其定义并建立评估标准。

Method: 通过中间输出表示定义DR任务，分离推理挑战与报告生成，并构建包含100个任务的LiveDRBench基准。

Result: OpenAI模型表现最佳（F1=0.55），其他系统F1得分在0.02-0.72之间。分析揭示了当前系统的搜索机制和推理行为。

Conclusion: 提出了DR的明确定义和评估基准，揭示了当前系统的局限性，为未来改进搜索机制和基础能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at
https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使采用先进的对齐技术，最先进的语言模型仍易受精心设计的对话场景攻击，导致多种形式的未对齐行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前对齐方法在叙事沉浸、情感压力和策略框架处理上的根本性漏洞。

Method: 通过系统手动红队测试和自动化评估框架MISALIGNMENTBENCH，验证攻击场景的普适性。

Result: 10种攻击场景在五种前沿LLM中平均漏洞率为76%，GPT-4.1最易受攻击（90%），Claude-4-Sonnet表现最佳（40%）。

Conclusion: 研究暴露了当前对齐策略的严重不足，强调了未来AI系统需增强对复杂场景操纵的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Motivation: 传统NLP方法在低资源、文化多样化的情感分析中表现不佳，需要一种更灵活、文化敏感的方法。

Method: 结合人工标注数据、情感反转反事实和基于规则的评估，测试LLMs的可解释性、鲁棒性和与人类推理的一致性。

Result: 发现模型推理质量差异显著，顶级LLMs表现稳定，而开源模型在模糊或情感变化时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强调了在复杂现实沟通中需要文化敏感、推理感知的AI评估。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard是一种推理时保护机制，通过注入安全时刻引导大型推理模型（LRMs）生成无害且有用的推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理任务中表现优异，但在推理过程中容易生成有害内容，现有防御机制依赖高成本微调和专家知识，限制了其扩展性。

Method: 利用模型内部注意力行为识别关键推理点，触发安全导向的反思，并在解码阶段采用缩放采样策略选择最优推理路径。

Result: ReasoningGuard有效缓解三类越狱攻击，优于七种现有保护机制，实现最先进的安全防御，同时避免过度安全化问题。

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard为大型推理模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的推理时安全保护方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

Motivation: 解决HTC中数据稀缺和模型复杂性的问题，探索黑盒LLMs作为传统机器学习方法的替代方案。

Method: 评估三种提示策略（DL、DH、TMH）在零样本和少样本设置下的表现，比较准确性和成本效益。

Result: 少样本设置提高准确性；LLMs在深层标签层次上表现优于传统模型，但API成本显著增加。

Conclusion: 黑盒LLMs在HTC中具有潜力，但需权衡提示策略的性能与成本。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列预测模型忽略文本信息，而现有单提示框架难以有效处理时间戳文本语义。

Method: 采用双提示机制（显式提示和文本提示），通过自注意力和前馈网络优化嵌入。

Result: 在多模态时间序列数据集上表现优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 双提示机制能有效整合文本上下文，提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

Conclusion: TalkDep为抑郁症诊断系统的训练和评估提供了有效的模拟患者资源，提升了系统的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Motivation: 现有方法仅保护前几个令牌的精度以维持注意力下沉，但未完全理解其机制，且无法处理后续出现的下沉问题。

Method: 研究注意力下沉在推理中的作用，提出KVSink方法预测下沉令牌，实现更全面的保护。

Result: KVSink优于现有PFN策略，结合KVQuant方法进一步降低困惑度（PPL）和减少对16位异常值的依赖。

Conclusion: KVSink为KV缓存量化提供了更高效的保护机制，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务基准主要关注基本用户意图（如查找或购买商品），但真实用户需求更复杂（如使用优惠券、管理预算等）。因此，需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 提出ShoppingBench基准，基于真实世界产品样本模拟用户指令，并构建包含250万产品的交互式购物沙盒环境。采用轨迹蒸馏策略，结合监督微调和强化学习，将大语言模型能力迁移到小模型。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4.1等先进语言代理，在ShoppingBench任务上的绝对成功率也低于50%。通过提出的方法，小模型性能接近GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: ShoppingBench为复杂购物意图提供了新的评估标准，并展示了通过蒸馏策略提升小模型性能的潜力。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphRAG通过知识图谱增强LLMs，但易受知识投毒攻击（KPAs）影响，导致下游推理严重误导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GraphRAG在知识图谱构建过程中的脆弱性，揭示其易受恶意操纵的风险。

Method: 提出两种知识投毒攻击（TKPA和UKPA），分别通过针对性修改和全局性破坏影响图谱构建。

Result: TKPA成功率达93.1%，UKPA仅修改0.05%文本即可使QA准确率从95%降至50%。现有防御方法无效。

Conclusion: GraphRAG的知识投毒防御研究尚不充分，需进一步探索安全机制。

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的标注框架用于文献综述生成，并评估了多种大语言模型在分类修辞角色上的表现，展示了高质量数据和微调的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过标注科学文献中的修辞角色（如研究空白、结果等），可以提升AI分析能力并支持高质量文献综述的生成。

Method: 1) 设计新的标注框架；2) 评估37种大语言模型在分类任务中的表现，包括零样本学习和微调方法；3) 使用专家标注和自动标注数据构建Sci-Sentence基准。

Result: 微调后的LLMs表现优异（F1>96%），大型专有模型（如GPT-4o）效果最佳，但轻量级开源模型也有出色表现；半合成数据提升小模型性能。

Conclusion: 高质量数据和微调是关键，开源模型在特定任务中表现优异，半合成数据扩展了训练数据的多样性。

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出动态熵加权方法（Dynamic Entropy Weighting），通过细粒度奖励分配提升强化学习在长链推理任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO）在长链推理任务中因粗粒度信用分配（对所有令牌应用统一奖励）而受限。

Method: 1) GTPO：为每个令牌分配熵加权奖励；2) GRPO-S：为每个序列分配基于平均令牌熵的奖励。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于DAPO基线，熵加权机制是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 动态熵加权为提升模型深度推理能力提供了更优路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了三种NLP模型（零样本开源大模型、微调Transformer和传统逻辑回归）在提升事故数据质量方面的表现，发现微调Transformer（如RoBERTa）性能最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过挖掘事故叙述提升事故数据质量，为肯塔基州的二次事故识别提供技术支持。

Method: 比较了零样本开源大模型、微调Transformer和逻辑回归模型在16,656条事故叙述上的表现，测试集为2022年的1,771条数据。

Result: 微调Transformer表现最佳（RoBERTa的F1分数为0.90），零样本大模型性能接近但计算成本高，逻辑回归表现较差。

Conclusion: 微调Transformer在精度和召回率上表现均衡，适合实际部署；大模型虽性能优异但计算成本高，需优化部署方案。

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

*Vladimír Havlík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的涌现能力，指出其源于深度神经网络（DNNs）的非线性动态系统特性，而非单纯参数扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决当代AI发展中‘创造而不理解’的认识论挑战，揭示DNNs涌现能力的本质。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证观察，结合标度律、grokking现象和模型能力相变，探究DNNs的非线性动态特性。

Result: 发现涌现能力源于高度敏感的非线性系统动态，而非参数扩展，类似自然复杂现象中的涌现特性。

Conclusion: 应将DNNs视为受涌现普遍原则支配的复杂动态系统新领域，理解其内部动态转变而非仅现象定义。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类选择性倾听的能力，以确定ASR在SDS中所需的性能，并评估其表现。

Method: 通过比较人类生成对话响应时的转录与参考转录，实验验证了选择性倾听的存在。

Result: 实验证实了人类在生成对话响应时的选择性倾听行为。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于人类选择性倾听的新ASR评估方法，可用于识别ASR系统与人类转录能力之间的差距。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少用户感知延迟（UPL），即用户在收到系统响应前的等待时间。

Method: 提出预测置信模型（PCM），通过比较预测的完整用户话语与实际话语的语义相似性来判断是否预取响应。

Result: 基于预测与实际用户话语的差异评估了PCM。

Conclusion: PCM能够有效判断预取响应的可行性，从而降低UPL。

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于COPC指南的客户支持对话（CSC）框架，构建了CSConv评估数据集和RoleCS训练数据集，通过LLM微调显著提升了对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话数据集缺乏策略指导，且真实服务数据难以获取和标注。

Method: 提出CSC框架，定义五个对话阶段和十二种策略，构建CSConv数据集和RoleCS训练集，使用LLM微调。

Result: 实验表明，微调后的LLM能生成更高质量的策略对齐响应，人类评估也证实问题解决能力提升。

Conclusion: CSC框架和数据集有效提升了客户支持对话的质量，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动形式化方法准确率低，主要缺乏形式化语言领域知识的全面掌握和自然语言问题理解与对齐的能力。

Method: 构建两个数据集：一个基于形式化知识的大规模示例，另一个通过专家设计的模板生成非形式化到形式化的推理轨迹。采用SFT和RLVR训练流程融合和优化这两种能力。

Result: 7B和32B模型在形式化知识和推理能力上表现优异，其中32B模型在FormalMATH-Lite和ProverBench上达到SOTA成绩。

Conclusion: ThinkingF通过提升形式化知识和推理能力，显著提高了自动形式化的准确率，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Motivation: 解决马来西亚教育系统中缺乏可扩展且高质量的教育评估工具的问题，尤其是在低资源语言（如马来语）中确保事实准确性和课程对齐的挑战。

Method: 研究比较了四种生成方法：非基础提示（结构化和基础）和两种RAG方法（一种使用LangChain框架，一种手动实现）。系统基于官方课程文件，并通过自动评估框架评估生成的问题。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

Motivation: 现有方法（如XL-LEXEME）仅关注同一词的不同语境，无法捕捉词间语义关系，因此需要扩展任务以提升语义表示的全面性。

Method: 提出Concept Differentiation任务，构建数据集并训练CALE模型，通过对比实验验证其性能。

Result: CALE模型在多任务中表现最佳，且其微调显著改变了嵌入的空间组织。

Conclusion: CALE模型提供了高效的通用语义表示，扩展了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

Result: 实验表明，StyliTruth显著减少风格化导致的真实性下降，并在风格与真实性平衡上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StyliTruth有效解决了风格化与真实性的权衡问题，为细粒度输出控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Conclusion: C-MIND为抑郁症评估提供了数据和算法基础，支持心理健康研究的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

*Magauiya Zhussip,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MASA的方法，通过跨层共享矩阵原子来减少Transformer模型的参数，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和内存需求限制了其广泛应用，现有压缩技术主要关注层内优化，而忽略了层间冗余。

Method: MASA将注意力投影矩阵分解为共享的矩阵原子，并通过线性组合表示各层权重，减少了66.7%的参数。

Result: 实验表明，MASA在相同参数预算下优于其他基线方法，并成功扩展到视觉Transformer（ViT）。

Conclusion: MASA为参数高效模型提供了可扩展的解决方案，且适用于预训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TURA框架，结合RAG与工具使用，解决传统RAG在动态实时查询中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法无法满足实时动态查询需求，如票务或库存信息，限制了搜索产品的工业应用。

Method: TURA框架包含意图感知检索模块、DAG任务规划器和轻量级代理执行器，结合静态与动态信息源。

Result: TURA成功应用于大规模工业系统，服务数百万用户，提供低延迟的实时答案。

Conclusion: TURA是首个系统化结合静态RAG与动态信息源的架构，为AI搜索产品提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Motivation: 为非专家用户提供通过自然语言查询关系型数据库的能力，适用于教育和商业智能领域。

Method: 开发了一个可重用、模型无关的流程，针对每种模型架构调整模式格式，并在Spider数据集上训练和评估。

Result: T5-Small在逻辑形式准确率（LFAcc）上表现最佳（27.8%），优于BART-Small（23.98%）和GPT-2（20.1%）。

Conclusion: 轻量级Transformer模型在资源稀缺环境中具有潜力，未来可通过改进模式链接或选择其他基础模型进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

TL;DR: P-Aligner通过轻量级模块优化指令表达，提升大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在交互中常因指令缺陷（如缺失上下文、模糊指示或不恰当语气）而无法满足安全、有用和诚实的要求，亟需改进。

Method: 提出P-Aligner模块，基于UltraPrompt数据集（通过蒙特卡洛树搜索合成的原则导向数据）训练，优化指令表达。

Result: P-Aligner在多种模型和基准测试中表现优异，如GPT-4-turbo和Gemma-2-SimPO的胜率分别提升28.35%和8.69%。

Conclusion: P-Aligner高效且有效，验证了其在数据质量、搜索策略和部署效率上的优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

TL;DR: RLVR提升LLM指令跟随能力但存在训练效率低和过优化问题。IFDecorator框架通过渐进挑战生成、意图对齐和陷阱检测解决这些问题，性能优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练效率低且易过优化，需改进以提升LLM指令跟随能力。

Method: IFDecorator框架包含渐进挑战生成（数据飞轮）、意图对齐模块（IntentCheck）和陷阱检测机制（trip wires）。

Result: Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator在IFEval上准确率达87.43%，优于GPT-4o，并在FollowBench表现优异。

Conclusion: IFDecorator有效提升训练效率和意图对齐，减少奖励滥用，成果将开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

Motivation: 研究反言论（counterspeech）在NLP领域的发展趋势，特别是利益相关者参与对数据集创建、模型开发和评估的影响。

Method: 通过系统回顾74项NLP研究，并结合与5个专注于在线性别暴力（oGBV）的非政府组织的参与式案例研究。

Result: 发现当前NLP研究与受在线有害内容影响最深的社区需求之间存在脱节。

Conclusion: 提出了重新聚焦利益相关者专业知识的具体建议，以改进反言论研究。

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

Motivation: 解决GRPO在模块化AI系统中难以直接应用的问题，优化多模块语言模型调用的性能。

Method: 提出mmGRPO，通过按模块分组处理语言模型调用，支持变长和中断轨迹，并结合自动提示优化。

Result: mmGRPO结合自动提示优化，在分类、多跳搜索和隐私保护任务中平均提升11%准确性，优于单独提示优化的5%。

Conclusion: mmGRPO是GRPO的有效扩展，适用于模块化AI系统，已开源为dspy.GRPO优化器。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

TL;DR: 论文提出Sculptor框架，通过主动上下文管理（ACM）工具帮助大语言模型（LLM）优化内部工作记忆，显著提升长上下文处理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长上下文时因主动干扰导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 引入Sculptor框架，提供三种工具：上下文分割、摘要/隐藏/恢复和智能搜索，帮助LLM主动管理注意力。

Result: 实验证明Sculptor在PI-LLM和NeedleBench等基准测试中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 主动上下文管理策略是提升长上下文任务可靠性的关键，而非仅依赖更大的上下文窗口。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

<details>

Motivation: 解决LLMs在持续微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，包括通用能力的显著遗忘和先前任务性能的急剧下降。

Method: 提出了General Sample Replay (GeRe)框架，结合基于阈值的边缘（TM）损失优化方法，保持重放学习中的激活状态一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TM方法在性能提升和鲁棒性方面优于其他重放策略。

Conclusion: GeRe框架为LLMs的高效重放提供了新思路，解决了持续学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Conclusion: FaST在有限数据下有效实现个性化偏好对齐，为研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI

study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

Motivation: 圆拟合算法在噪声点集中的效果受限，需通过异常值检测与去除提升精度。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部与全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: PCOD算法在工业垫圈零件的高精度直径测量中表现最佳，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PCOD算法能有效提升工业环境中的圆拟合精度，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

Result: 测量误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米，显著提高了精度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过少量已知参考零件，该方法实现了高精度测量，并为直径测量领域提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用音频辅助人脸视频修复网络（GAVN），通过身份和时间互补学习解决多种视频失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉与音频特征的关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且仅关注压缩伪影去除。

Method: GAVN先在低分辨率空间捕捉帧间时间特征进行粗修复，再在高分辨率空间结合音频信号和面部标志提取帧内身份特征以恢复细节，最后整合生成高质量视频。

Result: GAVN在压缩伪影去除、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN通过结合音频辅助和时间-身份特征互补，有效提升了人脸视频修复效果。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

challenges, such as limited temporal modeling, modality bias toward vision,
lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly
supervised learning, and incorporating higher-level reasoning for more
intelligent AVS systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V生成方法在多对象运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是对象轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重。

Method: 提出LayerT2V，通过分层生成视频，将每个对象置于独立层上，实现多对象合成的灵活控制。

Result: 实验表明，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上分别比SOTA方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V在多对象视频生成任务中表现出色，提供了更高的控制性和生成质量。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Method: 提出LLM4-IC8K框架，将IC图纸视为图像，分三步解决几何标注问题：感知引脚数量、计算引脚中心坐标、估计引脚尺寸。采用两阶段训练（合成数据预训练和真实数据微调）。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4-IC8K在ICGeo8K数据集上优于现有LMM。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K为IC机械图纸的几何标注提供了高效解决方案，并通过多模态数据集验证了其性能。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务中表现优异，并激活了强大的“思考”能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA通过多阶段设计和奖励监督，显著提升了IQA任务的性能，并展示了“思考”能力的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

TL;DR: 4D-PreNet是一个端到端的深度学习框架，用于解决4D-STEM数据预处理中的噪声、中心漂移和椭圆畸变问题，显著提升数据质量和实时分析效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高吞吐量4D-STEM数据采集中的数据预处理瓶颈（如噪声、中心漂移和椭圆畸变）限制了定量测量的准确性，传统算法缺乏通用性。

Method: 结合注意力增强的U-Net和ResNet架构，通过大规模模拟数据集训练，实现去噪、中心校正和椭圆畸变校准。

Result: 去噪任务中均方误差降低50%，中心定位误差低于0.04像素，显著优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为4D-STEM的高通量实时分析提供了可靠且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Conclusion: RiemanLine是一种高效且统一的3D线表示方法，能够自然嵌入并行性，适用于复杂环境中的相机定位和结构映射。

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

TL;DR: OmniDepth是一个统一框架，通过迭代双向对齐单目和立体深度估计的潜在表示，结合两者的优势，提升深度估计的鲁棒性和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目和立体深度估计各有优缺点，但实践中两者通常独立使用。OmniDepth旨在通过统一框架结合两者的优势，解决各自的问题。

Method: 采用迭代双向对齐机制，动态同步单目上下文线索与立体假设表示，通过交叉注意力机制优化深度估计。

Result: 在Middlebury和ETH3D数据集上，零样本泛化误差减少超过40%，并显著改善了透明和反射表面的处理效果。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过结合多视图几何和单目上下文，实现了超越单一模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

Result: 模型生成的形状表示在真实感上优于现有方法，并能应用于条件生成和疾病形态变化预测等下游任务。

Conclusion: 该模型成功生成了具有对应关系的形状表示，为形状生成和相关应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Motivation: 放射科医生通常混合使用多种医学图像阅读策略，但现有方法未能充分利用多模态和多区域信息。

Result: 在1325例多参数MRI数据集上验证，显著提高了分割准确性和标注效率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅优于标准分割网络，还能自主发展出可能不同于现有指南的策略，具有交互应用潜力。

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖高质量、特定类别的训练视频，难以扩展到开放世界中的多样化音频-视频类别。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段自动筛选大规模视频进行预训练，学习不完美的对齐；第二阶段在小规模高质量数据上微调。通过多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步性，并利用预训练模型减少额外参数。

Result: 在AVSync48基准测试中表现优异，减少手动标注需求10倍以上，并能泛化到多种开放类别。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了对高质量手动标注数据的依赖，同时保持了性能，适用于多样化音频-视频类别。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层次特征和模型特定特性，通用性和鲁棒性不足，而RAG方法在视觉领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID结合微调的CLIP图像编码器（RAVID CLIP）和视觉语言模型（VLM），动态检索相关图像并与查询图像融合，形成增强输入。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下仍保持80.27%的准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVID通过检索增强和视觉语言模型融合，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D图像估计食物营养成分是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可复现性。

Method: 使用ImageNet和COYO预训练的ViT模型，与CNN基线模型及基于JFT-300M预训练的SOTA方法对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上进行评估。

Result: JFT-300M预训练模型显著优于公开数据集预训练模型，COYO预训练模型表现意外差于ImageNet预训练模型。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计的迁移学习效果至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法破坏3D医学图像解剖连续性的问题，同时提升对小器官等难分割区域的训练效果。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：Slice-Block Shuffle保持解剖连续性，Confidence-Guided Displacement增强难分割区域的信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上显著优于现有方法，例如在Synapse数据集上仅用20%标注数据即获得4%的DSC提升。

Conclusion: JanusNet是一种即插即用的高效数据增强方法，适用于大多数师生框架，显著提升医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge系统在文本到CAD任务中表现出色，兼顾效率与效果。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT有效解决了视频扩散模型量化中的挑战，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering

### [131] [Can Large Multimodal Models Actively Recognize Faulty Inputs? A Systematic Evaluation Framework of Their Input Scrutiny Ability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04017)
*Haiqi Yang,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ISEval框架，评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）主动检测输入错误的能力，发现模型在无指导时难以识别错误，且表现因错误类型和模态信任度而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示大型语言模型被动接受错误输入，但LMMs是否具备主动检测能力尚不明确，需填补这一研究空白。

Method: 引入ISEval框架，包含七类错误前提和三项评估指标，对十种先进LMMs进行全面评估。

Result: 多数模型在无指导下难以主动检测错误，表现因错误类型和模态信任度差异显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调提升LMMs主动验证输入有效性的紧迫性，并为解决问题提供新思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDSSNet通过结合类语义和空间结构，解决了遥感图像语义分割中的高类内差异和高类间相似性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在遥感图像语义分割中难以统一类表示和区分相似特征，导致结果不完整。新兴方法也因粗糙的类原型表示和忽略目标结构信息而受限。

Method: 提出PDSSNet，包含三个模块：APEM（提取无偏类原型）、SSCM（语义优先、结构次优的协调）和CSAM（动态调整类间判别特征）。

Result: 实验表明PDSSNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过联合语义和结构信息，显著提升了遥感图像语义分割的完整性和准确性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种双提示学习框架DCAR，通过联合优化属性和类别特征，提升图像-文本检索任务中CLIP模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在图像-文本检索任务中表现不佳，主要挑战在于区分细粒度属性和相似子类别。

Method: DCAR框架动态调整语义和视觉维度的提示向量，联合优化属性和类别特征，并通过负样本和类别匹配加权学习子类别区分。

Result: 在构建的FDRD数据集上，DCAR达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，显著提升了图像-文本检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合单目摄像头和2D雷达点云数据的NLoS行人定位框架，以解决路边停车导致的盲区问题，提升道路安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中路边停车导致的NLoS盲区对道路安全构成挑战，现有方法依赖预设空间信息或简单反射假设，缺乏实时性和普适性。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停车车辆，利用深度估计推断空间特征，再结合2D雷达点云数据实现精确空间推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能更早检测行人，提升道路安全。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了动态停车环境下的NLoS行人定位问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2为UDA重识别提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的自挖掘先验引导联合频率增强网络（SPJFNet），解决了现有暗图像恢复方法在计算负担、冗余操作和频率处理效率上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法依赖外部先验、多阶段增强流程复杂且频率处理效率低，导致计算负担和性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出SPJFNet，包括自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）和双频率引导框架（DFGF），通过轻量级内生先验和频率域优化提升效率。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过内生先验和频率域优化，实现了高效且高性能的暗图像恢复。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准存在仿真与现实的差距、任务复杂度有限和推理覆盖不完整的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过构建包含12种语义多样任务的数据集，系统评估空间、过程和定量三个推理维度，并采用可扩展的数据构建流程。

Result: 现有模型在静态空间任务表现良好，但在动态多步推理场景中存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有模型在时间建模和因果推理上的弱点，为未来开发更强大的VTR系统指明了方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验表明，IPA-CP优于现有半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: IPA-CP为小体积肿瘤分割提供了一种有效解决方案，并通过技术贡献验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Conclusion: DOMR框架通过集成方法显著提升了跨视角理解的效果。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络）主要利用局部可预测性，忽略了k空间的全局依赖性，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 从湮灭角度提出GPI作为新的k空间结构化低秩（SLR）模型，将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开SLR的优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT是一种高效且可解释的k空间插值方法，为加速MRI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff为文档修复提供了一种高效、可扩展的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhaochen Liu,Kaiwen Gao,Shuyi Liang,Bin Xiao,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma,Tingting Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了O-Bench，首个专为遮挡感知设计的视觉问答基准，揭示了当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）与人类在遮挡感知上的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但MLLMs在此领域的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于SA-1B构建1,365张语义连贯的遮挡图像，标注4,588个问答对，评估22种MLLMs。

Result: 发现MLLMs与人类存在显著性能差距，无法通过模型扩展或思维过程弥补，并识别了三种典型失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并有望推动MLLMs的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

*Chengqian Dai,Yonghong Guo,Hongzhao Xiang,Yigui Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TNet的新型解码器网络，通过卷积和加法操作逐步整合多分辨率特征，解决了现有方法忽略全局上下文依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感分割网络（如UNet）通常关注局部特征交互，而忽略了多分辨率间的全局上下文依赖。

Method: 提出TNet，利用卷积和加法操作逐步将低分辨率特征（全局上下文丰富）融入高分辨率特征（局部细节丰富）。

Result: 在ISPRS Vaihingen、ISPRS Potsdam和LoveDA数据集上，TNet-R分别达到85.35%、87.05%和52.19%的mIoU，且计算高效。

Conclusion: TNet通过简单有效的设计，成功融合了全局与局部信息，在多个数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

Motivation: 解决现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未考虑或仅隐式考虑3D一致性的问题。

Method: 使用显式的3D高斯泼溅场景表示，结合2D扩散模型，无需额外微调。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上表现优异，生成高分辨率且视觉吸引力的结果，同时保持3D结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR通过显式3D表示提升了视觉质量，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏视图条件下难以实现准确的几何重建，且传统平滑方法会破坏语义边界和纹理细节。

Method: DET-GS结合了分层几何深度监督框架和边缘感知深度正则化，并引入RGB引导的边缘保留总变差损失。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS通过多级几何一致性和边缘保留策略，显著提升了稀疏视图重建的质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Motivation: 医学图像分析因标注数据有限而受限，现有方法未能充分利用视觉语言模型的潜力，导致模态不对齐。

Method: 提出NEARL-CLIP框架，包含USEformer（动态生成跨模态查询）和OCA（正交技术分离新知识）。

Result: NEARL-CLIP以仅1.46M可学习参数实现了模态交互的优化。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP通过跨模态交互和正交技术，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能，同时保持高效性。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

TL;DR: MLLMSeg是一个新颖的框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的视觉细节特征，无需额外视觉编码器，通过DSFF模块融合细节与语义特征，轻量级解码器实现精确分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在像素级密集预测上的不足，避免现有方法中参数过多或精度牺牲的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征，结合DSFF模块融合细节与语义特征，使用轻量级解码器（34M参数）进行分割。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg在性能和成本间取得更好平衡，优于SAM-based和SAM-free方法。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过充分利用MLLM视觉编码器特征，实现了高效且精确的参考表达分割。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法在车辆重识别和行人搜索任务上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle通过联合建模和层次化学习，有效解决了车辆搜索中的挑战，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: SSD-Net通过单尺度特征提取和动态跨层信息交互，有效提升水下图像增强性能。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和自适应监督损失，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Result: 在12个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中表现优于现有少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督MLLMs方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和适应性，为少样本细粒度视觉分类提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

TL;DR: ICM-Fusion结合元学习和上下文适应，通过动态平衡任务向量方向，解决了多任务LoRA模型中的权重冲突和领域遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA融合方法在多任务适应中易引发权重冲突和领域遗忘，且在少样本场景下泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出ICM-Fusion框架，利用任务向量算术和Fusion VAE动态优化任务向量方向，实现多任务LoRA生成。

Result: 实验表明ICM-Fusion能显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion是一种高效的多任务LoRA融合方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型数据集和标签生成模块，用于增强多模态在线环境中的内容审核能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中的有害内容传播问题日益严重，但数据获取和标注成本高阻碍了有效的审核系统开发。

Method: 构建了包含6,300个真实世界模因帖子的数据集，分两阶段标注（毒性和细粒度分类），并引入辅助元数据和社会化标签生成模块。

Result: 实验表明，结合社会化标签显著提升了最先进视觉语言模型在检测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态在线环境中的内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GRPO的方法在训练数据利用和推理过程监督上存在不足，限制了MLLMs在专业异常检测中的应用。

Method: 引入多阶段推理过程，从区域识别到聚焦检查，并设计细粒度奖励机制，结合分类准确性和定位监督。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证，显著提升了通用视觉语言模型在专业异常检测中的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效填补了通用MLLMs能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距，实现了高效适应和准确检测。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法忽视特征表示的内在不确定性，尤其在极暗条件下，梯度退化和噪声主导会损害模型可靠性和因果推理。

Method: 提出U2CLLIE框架，包含不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）和层次因果感知框架（LEN、NeCo、AsC）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE通过不确定性感知和因果建模，显著提升了低光图像增强的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Method: 在本地环境中训练ViT-22B，分析其训练不稳定性并进行模型调整；同时设计基于ViT的图像生成架构，比较ViT与ViT-22B的适用性。

Result: ViT-22B在相同参数规模下性能优于ViT，且在图像生成任务中展现出潜力。

Conclusion: ViT-22B在性能和扩展性上具有优势，但需进一步优化训练稳定性；其在图像生成中的应用值得探索。

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RPCA模型存在计算负担大、超参数依赖强和动态场景适应性差的问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出RPCANet++框架，包含背景近似模块（BAM）、目标提取模块（OEM）和图像恢复模块（IRM），并引入记忆增强模块（MAM）和深度对比先验模块（DCPM）优化性能。

Result: 在多种数据集上验证了RPCANet++的先进性能，并通过可视化和数值测量提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++结合RPCA理论和深度网络效率，为稀疏目标分割设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学MLLMs的训练数据可能包含隐私信息和错误知识，导致部署后隐私泄露或错误输出。完全重新训练成本高昂，因此需要机器遗忘技术。

Method: 提出MLLMU-Med基准，通过数据生成管道将合成隐私数据和事实错误整合到训练集中，并设计遗忘效率评分。评估了五种遗忘方法。

Result: 现有方法在移除有害知识方面效果有限，显示改进空间。

Conclusion: 该研究为生物医学MLLMs的安全遗忘提供了新基准和研究方向。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Result: GAT在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率提升3.86%，推理速度比现有方法快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT通过实例导向方法显著提升了视频文本视觉问答的性能和效率。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Result: 在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上，BootSC的NMI指标比第二名方法提高了16%。

Conclusion: BootSC实现了最先进的聚类性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖特定多步推理数据集和强化学习策略，训练成本高且泛化能力有限。

Method: ViFP构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板，通过多轮问答构建有效推理路径，并动态分析推理路径一致性以识别FP。

Result: 在A-OKVQA数据集上，ViFP将准确率提升5.4%，FP数量显著减少。

Conclusion: ViFP不仅提高了答案准确性，还通过可靠性评估指标VoC验证了其在增强推理可靠性方面的优势。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建动态3D场景的挑战在于需要从有限观测中联合推断运动、结构和外观，现有方法因耦合建模导致运动泄漏和几何失真。

Method: SplitGaussian将场景表示显式分解为静态和动态组件，解耦运动建模与背景几何，仅允许动态分支随时间变形。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提升了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and

classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Result: 实验表明，PIS3R在大视差场景下表现优于现有方法，且保持几何完整性。

Conclusion: PIS3R是一种高效的大视差图像拼接解决方案，适用于下游3D视觉任务。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from

While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the
complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究低估了PVMs在CSS中的抗遗忘能力，认为DFT性能较差，但作者通过实验发现PVMs本身能有效保留知识。

Method: 通过系统实验分析DFT在两种标准数据集（Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K）和两种PVM骨干（ResNet101和Swin-B）下的表现，并提出DFT*改进方法，包括冻结骨干和预分配分类器。

Result: 实验表明DFT*在性能上优于16种现有方法，且训练参数和时间更少。

Conclusion: PVMs的抗遗忘能力被低估，DFT*是一种简单高效的CSS方法。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和可行性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种高效、鲁棒的点云配准方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized

baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for

mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple

Conclusion: LATR通过明确查询角色和利用长度先验，显著提升了时序句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有高效性、泛化性和可扩展性，为DAS信号识别提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: Obliviate是一种高效轻量的方法，能有效缓解LVLMs的幻觉问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TSPO的强化学习方法，用于优化多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频输入中的帧采样策略，以提升视频语言理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频MLLMs在处理长视频时，由于上下文限制和训练成本，通常采用稀疏帧采样方法，但这些方法可能遗漏关键事件或受限于预训练模型的事件理解能力。

Method: 论文提出了TSPO方法，包括一个可训练的事件感知时间代理，用于捕获事件与查询的关联性，并通过强化学习将关键帧选择和语言生成建模为联合决策过程。

Result: 实验表明，TSPO在多个长视频理解基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，并显示出在不同前沿视频MLLMs中的可迁移能力。

Conclusion: TSPO通过强化学习优化帧采样策略，显著提升了MLLMs在长视频语言理解任务中的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，MSE降低6%-44%，概率预测排名第一。

Conclusion: 为跨模态知识迁移和通用时间序列基础模型的发展提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Motivation: 耳部生物特征识别因标注数据稀缺和类内差异大而受限，现有方法难以提取一致且具判别性的特征。

Method: ProtoN采用图结构表示多个耳部样本，通过PGNN层和双路径消息传递机制优化样本和原型表示，并结合跨图原型对齐策略和混合损失函数。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，ProtoN实现了99.60%的Rank-1识别准确率和0.025的EER，性能领先。

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，为数据稀缺条件下的生物特征识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Conclusion: VITAL通过工具增强学习和多任务强化学习，显著提升了视频推理能力，为长视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Transformer在多任务学习中因注意力矩阵规模随任务数平方增长，计算开销大，硬件受限。

Method: 提出Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention，高效聚合不同任务的特征图信息。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，FLOPs和推理延迟降低一个数量级，任务预测质量提升高达7.4%。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了多任务学习中Transformer的计算瓶颈，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Result: CORE在基础和新型类别上显著优于现有模型，为细粒度多模态检索研究提供了简单有效的基线。

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为细粒度多模态检索开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Conclusion: LoRA适应基础模型在有限数据和跨域任务中表现优异，但传统架构的全微调仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

Conclusion: CVC任务和自改进框架有效提升了LVLMs的视觉感知和推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦和级联方法有效生成高质量4D内容，为实际应用提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Result: 实验表明，ErasePro在不同概念擦除任务中表现优异，实现了更彻底的擦除和更好的生成质量。

Conclusion: ErasePro为概念擦除任务提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Conclusion: 因果增量嵌入是一种有效的干预表示方法，能够显著提升模型在OOD场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督骨架动作分割方法有效且性能优越，代码已开源。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

TL;DR: RAIDX是一个结合检索增强生成（RAG）和组相对策略优化（GRPO）的新型深度伪造检测框架，旨在提高检测准确性和决策可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法缺乏透明性，且依赖人工标注。RAIDX通过结合RAG和GRPO，解决了这些问题。

Method: RAIDX利用RAG引入外部知识提升检测准确性，并采用GRPO自动生成细粒度文本解释和显著性图。

Result: 实验表明，RAIDX在多个基准测试中表现出色，实现了最先进的检测性能，并提供了可解释的文本描述和显著性图。

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，填补了准确性和可解释性方面的关键空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法多关注特征级知识转移，忽视了教师模型logit分布中的关键信息。

Method: TopKD包含两个主要组件：Top-K Scaling Module（TSM）和Top-K Decoupled Loss（TDL），无需额外模块或架构改动。

Result: 在多个数据集（如CIFAR-100、ImageNet等）上，TopKD表现优于现有蒸馏方法，且适用于Vision Transformers。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的潜力，是一种简单高效的通用框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer能有效捕捉步态信号的局部和全局特征，显著提升PD严重程度分类性能。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频时间定位（OnVTG）需要在未观察未来帧的情况下定位与文本查询相关的事件，现有方法因缺乏有效事件建模和长期历史信息保留而表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于事件的分层事件记忆框架，通过事件提案建模事件级信息，并引入分层事件记忆保留历史事件信息，同时设计了未来预测分支以实现实时预测。

Result: 在TACoS、ActivityNet Captions和MAD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆方法有效提升了OnVTG的性能，解决了长期历史信息保留和实时预测的挑战。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将虚拟试穿和虚拟试脱视为独立任务，忽视了它们的互补对称性，因此需要一种统一框架来解决这一根本性差距。

Method: 提出TWGTM模型，通过双向特征解耦和双条件指导（潜在空间和像素空间）实现任务统一，并采用分阶段训练解决掩模依赖不对称问题。

Result: 在DressCode和VITON-HD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性和竞争力。

Conclusion: TWGTM首次统一解决了VTON和VTOFF任务，为服装中心图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Conclusion: 基于事件视觉的技术为下一代高效、低延迟的反无人机系统提供了强大基础。

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff为牙齿矫正治疗提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad

Conclusion: K2Sight框架通过结合领域知识与空间结构，实现了高效且高性能的医疗图像定位。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯SLAM的在线3D重建方法，结合前馈循环预测模块直接从光流推断相机姿态，显著提升跟踪速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在长序列处理或依赖深度传感器时的不足，提升3D重建的效率和精度。

Method: 集成深度估计器到RGB-D SLAM系统，利用3D高斯映射解决几何细节不准确问题，引入局部图渲染技术增强前馈姿态预测的鲁棒性。

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上表现与SplaTAM相当，跟踪时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法通过快速网络推断替代慢速优化，显著提升了3D重建的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

TL;DR: 本文研究了双耳对称性对CNN耳部识别效果的影响，提出了一种自动分类耳部图像左右的方法，并发现分开处理左右耳能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双耳对称性对CNN学习特征的影响尚未得到充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发耳部侧边分类器，自动区分左右耳，并在训练和测试中利用这一信息。通过跨数据集评估和消融实验验证效果。

Result: 分开处理左右耳能显著提升识别性能，消融实验提供了训练CNN耳部识别系统的实用建议。

Conclusion: 双耳对称性对CNN耳部识别有重要影响，分开处理左右耳是提升性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,

that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出EncQA基准，评估多模态视觉语言模型在图表理解中的视觉推理能力，发现模型性能与规模无关，需针对性策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解基准上的进步未能全面覆盖视觉推理能力的需求。

Method: 引入EncQA基准，包含2,076个合成问答对，覆盖6种视觉编码和8种任务，评估9种先进模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同编码和任务间差异显著，且模型规模对许多任务-编码组合无提升。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解需针对性解决视觉推理差距，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在像素级感知理解上的不足，以及Segment Anything Model在多掩码预测和类别特定分割任务中的局限性。

Method: 提出统一的框架和训练策略，支持多数据集协同训练，并引入视觉接地分割任务。

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态、像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 粗粒度房间布局估计为下游任务提供重要几何线索，但现有方法多基于单视图且假设全景图像。

Method: 通过端到端训练优化密集深度特征的多视图对齐，学习具有大收敛域和平滑损失的特征图。

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics新基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并可扩展至多房间估计。

Conclusion: PixCuboid通过优化方法灵活高效地估计房间布局，且易于扩展。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune是一种新型压缩框架，通过分层修剪、权重保护和敏感度引导蒸馏技术，显著减少扩散模型的参数规模，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像扩散模型在资源受限设备上推理的挑战。

Method: 结合分层位置修剪、位置权重保护和敏感度引导蒸馏三种技术。

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune在保持感知质量的同时，显著优于现有方法，适用于设备端推理。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

TL;DR: ANPrompt是一种新的提示调优框架，旨在增强视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性，通过噪声提示和抗噪声目标提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法对弱语义扰动（如图像或文本噪声）的脆弱性导致模型泛化能力下降，需要改进。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和噪声扰动的文本嵌入构建噪声提示，生成抗噪声提示并注入编码器深层，同时计算噪声抵抗视觉提示原型（NRVPP）和引入多种损失目标。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt表现优于现有方法，具有更强的抗噪声能力和对新类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过噪声提示和抗噪声目标显著提升了视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注BEV编码器和任务特定头，忽略了表示学习的潜力。BEVCon旨在填补这一空白。

Method: BEVCon引入两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块优化BEV特征，视角对比模块增强图像主干网络，结合检测损失实现密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验显示，BEVCon性能显著提升，mAP最高提升2.4%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空不一致性问题。

Method: 提出ST-Occ框架，包含时空记忆模块和注意力机制，用于高效存储历史信息并建模不确定性。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中，性能提升3 mIoU，时间不一致性降低29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ通过时空特征学习和动态建模，显著提升了3D占用预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

Motivation: 解决情感计算模型从实验室环境到现实环境迁移的可靠性问题。

Result: 在RECOLA和AGAIN数据集上，PriCon模型表现优于LUPI和端到端模型，接近多模态训练模型的性能。

Conclusion: PriCon为缩小实验室与现实环境情感建模差距提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) has made significant progress with the advent of
deep learning, yet a persistent challenge remains: the reliable transfer of
affective models from controlled laboratory settings (in-vitro) to uncontrolled
real-world environments (in-vivo). To address this challenge we introduce the
Privileged Contrastive Pretraining (PriCon) framework according to which models
are first pretrained via supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and then act as
teacher models within a Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework.
PriCon both leverages privileged information during training and enhances the
robustness of derived affect models via SCL. Experiments conducted on two
benchmark affective corpora, RECOLA and AGAIN, demonstrate that models trained
using PriCon consistently outperform LUPI and end to end models. Remarkably, in
many cases, PriCon models achieve performance comparable to models trained with
access to all modalities during both training and testing. The findings
underscore the potential of PriCon as a paradigm towards further bridging the
gap between in-vitro and in-vivo affective modelling, offering a scalable and
practical solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: PILOT-C在多维轨迹压缩中表现优异，为高效轨迹数据处理提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Location-aware devices continuously generate massive volumes of trajectory
data, creating demand for efficient compression. Line simplification is a
common solution but typically assumes 2D trajectories and ignores time
synchronization and motion continuity. We propose PILOT-C, a novel trajectory
compression framework that integrates frequency-domain physics modeling with
error-bounded optimization. Unlike existing line simplification methods,
PILOT-C supports trajectories in arbitrary dimensions, including 3D, by
compressing each spatial axis independently. Evaluated on four real-world
datasets, PILOT-C achieves superior performance across multiple dimensions. In
terms of compression ratio, PILOT-C outperforms CISED-W, the current
state-of-the-art SED-based line simplification algorithm, by an average of
19.2%. For trajectory fidelity, PILOT-C achieves an average of 32.6% reduction
in error compared to CISED-W. Additionally, PILOT-C seamlessly extends to
three-dimensional trajectories while maintaining the same computational
complexity, achieving a 49% improvement in compression ratios over SQUISH-E,
the most efficient line simplification algorithm on 3D datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CXR诊断模型依赖一次性方法，缺乏对推理过程的监督，导致多任务诊断中的推理冗长、奖励稀疏和幻觉问题。

Result: CX-Mind在视觉理解、文本生成和时空对齐方面显著优于现有模型，性能提升25.1%。

Conclusion: CX-Mind在多中心专家评估中表现出临床实用性，为CXR诊断提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）在预训练中可能保留不准确或过时的信息，导致推理时的错误预测或偏见输出。现有编辑方法难以同时编辑大量事实信息且可能损害模型的通用能力。

Method: 通过操纵特定实体的潜在知识，利用轻量级超网络（LKS）编辑LLMs的内部表示，类似于编辑自然语言输入。

Result: 在Llama-2和Mistral上的实验表明，即使同时编辑数量达到10,000，LKS仍能有效进行知识编辑并保持模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: LKS是一种可行的大规模知识编辑方法，能够在不损害模型通用能力的情况下精确编辑LLMs的知识。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often retain inaccurate or outdated information
from pre-training, leading to incorrect predictions or biased outputs during
inference. While existing model editing methods can address this challenge,
they struggle with editing large amounts of factual information simultaneously
and may compromise the general capabilities of the models. In this paper, our
empirical study demonstrates that it is feasible to edit the internal
representations of LLMs and replace the entities in a manner similar to editing
natural language inputs. Based on this insight, we introduce the Latent
Knowledge Scalpel (LKS), an LLM editor that manipulates the latent knowledge of
specific entities via a lightweight hypernetwork to enable precise and
large-scale editing. Experiments conducted on Llama-2 and Mistral show even
with the number of simultaneous edits reaching 10,000, LKS effectively performs
knowledge editing while preserving the general abilities of the edited LLMs.

Conclusion: GlaBoost为青光眼诊断提供了透明且可扩展的解决方案，并可扩展到其他眼科疾病。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

Motivation: 多维数据补全在计算科学中至关重要，现有方法（低秩或平滑性）各有局限性，如计算成本高或泛化能力差。

Method: LRTuckerRep结合Tucker分解，通过自适应加权核范数编码低秩性，拉普拉斯正则化捕获平滑性，并开发两种迭代算法求解非凸优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，LRTuckerRep在高缺失率下比基线方法具有更高的补全准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep有效统一了全局和局部先验，在多维数据补全中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

Abstract: The specification of prior distributions is fundamental in Bayesian
inference, yet it remains a significant bottleneck. The prior elicitation
process is often a manual, subjective, and unscalable task. We propose a novel
framework which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and scale
this process. We introduce \texttt{LLMPrior}, a principled operator that
translates rich, unstructured contexts such as natural language descriptions,
data or figures into valid, tractable probability distributions. We formalize
this operator by architecturally coupling an LLM with an explicit, tractable
generative model, such as a Gaussian Mixture Model (forming a LLM based Mixture
Density Network), ensuring the resulting prior satisfies essential mathematical
properties. We further extend this framework to multi-agent systems where
Logarithmic Opinion Pooling is employed to aggregate prior distributions
induced by decentralized knowledge. We present the federated prior aggregation
algorithm, \texttt{Fed-LLMPrior}, for aggregating distributed,
context-dependent priors in a manner robust to agent heterogeneity. This work
provides the foundation for a new class of tools that can potentially lower the
barrier to entry for sophisticated Bayesian modeling.

Conclusion: 该方法在未知环境中优化最坏情况性能方面具有显著优势，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces significant challenges in real-world
deployments due to the sim-to-real gap, where policies trained in simulators
often underperform in practice due to mismatches between training and
deployment conditions. Distributionally robust RL addresses this issue by
optimizing worst-case performance over an uncertainty set of environments and
providing an optimized lower bound on deployment performance. However, existing
studies typically assume access to either a generative model or offline
datasets with broad coverage of the deployment environment -- assumptions that
limit their practicality in unknown environments without prior knowledge. In
this work, we study the more realistic and challenging setting of online
distributionally robust RL, where the agent interacts only with a single
unknown training environment while aiming to optimize its worst-case
performance. We focus on general $f$-divergence-based uncertainty sets,
including Chi-Square and KL divergence balls, and propose a computationally
efficient algorithm with sublinear regret guarantees under minimal assumptions.
Furthermore, we establish a minimax lower bound on regret of online learning,
demonstrating the near-optimality of our approach. Extensive experiments across
diverse environments further confirm the robustness and efficiency of our
algorithm, validating our theoretical findings.

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和AIME 2024基准测试中验证了GTPO的稳定性和性能提升。

Conclusion: GTPO解决了GRPO的局限性，提供了一种更有效的策略优化方法，无需参考模型即可实现稳定训练。

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) scattering modeling is critical for radar remote
sensing, however, its inherent complexity introduces significant computational
challenges. Traditional numerical solvers offer high accuracy, but suffer from
scalability issues and substantial computational costs. Pure data-driven deep
learning approaches, while efficient, lack physical constraints embedding
during training and require extensive labeled data, limiting their
applicability and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
U-shaped Physics-Informed Network (U-PINet), the first fully
deep-learning-based, physics-informed hierarchical framework for computational
EM designed to ensure physical consistency while maximizing computational
efficiency. Motivated by the hierarchical decomposition strategy in EM solvers
and the inherent sparsity of local EM coupling, the U-PINet models the
decomposition and coupling of near- and far-field interactions through a
multiscale processing neural network architecture, while employing a
physics-inspired sparse graph representation to efficiently model both self-
and mutual- coupling among mesh elements of complex $3$-Dimensional (3D)
objects. This principled approach enables end-to-end multiscale EM scattering
modeling with improved efficiency, generalization, and physical consistency.
Experimental results showcase that the U-PINet accurately predicts surface
current distributions, achieving close agreement with traditional solver, while
significantly reducing computational time and outperforming conventional deep
learning baselines in both accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, our
evaluations on radar cross section prediction tasks confirm the feasibility of
the U-PINet for downstream EM scattering applications.

Abstract: Estimating heat flux in the nuclear fusion device EAST is a critically
important task. Traditional scientific computing methods typically model this
process using the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, FEM relies on
grid-based sampling for computation, which is computationally inefficient and
hard to perform real-time simulations during actual experiments. Inspired by
artificial intelligence-powered scientific computing, this paper proposes a
novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to address this challenge,
significantly accelerating the heat conduction estimation process while
maintaining high accuracy. Specifically, given inputs of different materials,
we first feed spatial coordinates and time stamps into the neural network, and
compute boundary loss, initial condition loss, and physical loss based on the
heat conduction equation. Additionally, we sample a small number of data points
in a data-driven manner to better fit the specific heat conduction scenario,
further enhancing the model's predictive capability. We conduct experiments
under both uniform and non-uniform heating conditions on the top surface.
Experimental results show that the proposed thermal conduction physics-informed
neural network achieves accuracy comparable to the finite element method, while
achieving $\times$40 times acceleration in computational efficiency. The

Abstract: While recent advances in foundation models have improved the state of the art
in many domains, some problems in empirical sciences could not benefit from
this progress yet. Soil horizon classification, for instance, remains
challenging because of its multimodal and multitask characteristics and a
complex hierarchically structured label taxonomy. Accurate classification of
soil horizons is crucial for monitoring soil health, which directly impacts
agricultural productivity, food security, ecosystem stability and climate
resilience. In this work, we propose $\textit{SoilNet}$ - a multimodal
multitask model to tackle this problem through a structured modularized
pipeline. Our approach integrates image data and geotemporal metadata to first
predict depth markers, segmenting the soil profile into horizon candidates.
Each segment is characterized by a set of horizon-specific morphological
features. Finally, horizon labels are predicted based on the multimodal
concatenated feature vector, leveraging a graph-based label representation to
account for the complex hierarchical relationships among soil horizons. Our
method is designed to address complex hierarchical classification, where the
number of possible labels is very large, imbalanced and non-trivially
structured. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
soil profile dataset. All code and experiments can be found in our repository:

Motivation: 随着模型规模的指数增长，参数高效微调（PEFT）变得至关重要。尽管LoRA方法在实践中表现出色，但其理论理解仍然有限。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 理论分析证明了各变体的收敛性，实验验证了其实际效果。

Conclusion: Bernoulli-LoRA为PEFT方法提供了理论支持，同时保持了实际有效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a crucial approach for
adapting large foundational models to specific tasks, particularly as model
sizes continue to grow exponentially. Among PEFT methods, Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) (arXiv:2106.09685) stands out for its effectiveness and simplicity,
expressing adaptations as a product of two low-rank matrices. While extensive
empirical studies demonstrate LoRA's practical utility, theoretical
understanding of such methods remains limited. Recent work on RAC-LoRA
(arXiv:2410.08305) took initial steps toward rigorous analysis. In this work,
we introduce Bernoulli-LoRA, a novel theoretical framework that unifies and
extends existing LoRA approaches. Our method introduces a probabilistic
Bernoulli mechanism for selecting which matrix to update. This approach
encompasses and generalizes various existing update strategies while
maintaining theoretical tractability. Under standard assumptions from
non-convex optimization literature, we analyze several variants of our
framework: Bernoulli-LoRA-GD, Bernoulli-LoRA-SGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-PAGE,
Bernoulli-LoRA-MVR, Bernoulli-LoRA-QGD, Bernoulli-LoRA-MARINA, and
Bernoulli-LoRA-EF21, establishing convergence guarantees for each variant.
Additionally, we extend our analysis to convex non-smooth functions, providing
convergence rates for both constant and adaptive (Polyak-type) stepsizes.
Through extensive experiments on various tasks, we validate our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the practical efficacy of our approach. This work is a
step toward developing theoretically grounded yet practically effective PEFT
methods.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化（BO）在高维和大规模评估时面临计算复杂度高的问题，而基于神经网络的BO方法依赖模型不确定性估计，计算复杂。

Method: SNBO通过分离探索与开发标准添加新样本，并自适应控制采样区域，避免模型不确定性估计。

Conclusion: SNBO是一种高效且可扩展的黑盒优化方法，适用于高维和大规模评估场景。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used approach for blackbox
optimization that leverages a Gaussian process (GP) model and an acquisition
function to guide future sampling. While effective in low-dimensional settings,
BO faces scalability challenges in high-dimensional spaces and with large
number of function evaluations due to the computational complexity of GP
models. In contrast, neural networks (NNs) offer better scalability and can
model complex functions, which led to the development of NN-based BO
approaches. However, these methods typically rely on estimating model
uncertainty in NN prediction -- a process that is often computationally
intensive and complex, particularly in high dimensions. To address these
limitations, a novel method, called scalable neural network-based blackbox
optimization (SNBO), is proposed that does not rely on model uncertainty
estimation. Specifically, SNBO adds new samples using separate criteria for
exploration and exploitation, while adaptively controlling the sampling region
to ensure efficient optimization. SNBO is evaluated on a range of optimization
problems spanning from 10 to 102 dimensions and compared against four
state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Across the majority of test problems,
SNBO attains function values better than the best-performing baseline
algorithm, while requiring 40-60% fewer function evaluations and reducing the
runtime by at least an order of magnitude.

Conclusion: DP-NCB为隐私保护和公平性并重的老虎机算法提供了理论基础，适用于高风险的决策场景。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit algorithms are fundamental tools for sequential
decision-making under uncertainty, with widespread applications across domains
such as clinical trials and personalized decision-making. As bandit algorithms
are increasingly deployed in these socially sensitive settings, it becomes
critical to protect user data privacy and ensure fair treatment across decision
rounds. While prior work has independently addressed privacy and fairness in
bandit settings, the question of whether both objectives can be achieved
simultaneously has remained largely open. Existing privacy-preserving bandit
algorithms typically optimize average regret, a utilitarian measure, whereas
fairness-aware approaches focus on minimizing Nash regret, which penalizes
inequitable reward distributions, but often disregard privacy concerns.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce Differentially Private Nash Confidence Bound
(DP-NCB)-a novel and unified algorithmic framework that simultaneously ensures
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and achieves order-optimal Nash regret,
matching known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. The framework is
sufficiently general to operate under both global and local differential
privacy models, and is anytime, requiring no prior knowledge of the time
horizon. We support our theoretical guarantees with simulations on synthetic
bandit instances, showing that DP-NCB incurs substantially lower Nash regret
than state-of-the-art baselines. Our results offer a principled foundation for
designing bandit algorithms that are both privacy-preserving and fair, making
them suitable for high-stakes, socially impactful applications.

Motivation: 扩展Perch模型的应用范围，从仅针对鸟类扩展到多类群，并探索细粒度物种分类作为生物声学预训练任务的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用自蒸馏和原型学习分类器，结合新的源预测训练准则进行训练。

Conclusion: 细粒度物种分类是生物声学预训练的鲁棒任务，Perch 2.0在多类群和迁移学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Perch is a performant pre-trained model for bioacoustics. It was trained in
supervised fashion, providing both off-the-shelf classification scores for
thousands of vocalizing species as well as strong embeddings for transfer
learning. In this new release, Perch 2.0, we expand from training exclusively
on avian species to a large multi-taxa dataset. The model is trained with
self-distillation using a prototype-learning classifier as well as a new
source-prediction training criterion. Perch 2.0 obtains state-of-the-art
performance on the BirdSet and BEANS benchmarks. It also outperforms
specialized marine models on marine transfer learning tasks, despite having
almost no marine training data. We present hypotheses as to why fine-grained
species classification is a particularly robust pre-training task for
bioacoustics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种可分部训练的替代模型（VAE-DNN），用于求解参数化非线性偏微分方程的正反问题，其训练效率与精度优于FNO和DeepONet。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有替代模型（如FNO和DeepONet）训练耗时且能耗高，需改进其效率与精度。

Method: 模型分为编码器、神经网络和译码器三部分，可独立训练；编码器与译码器分别作为变分自编码器（VAE）的一部分。

Result: VAE-DNN在非线性扩散方程的正反问题求解中，训练时间与能耗显著降低，且精度优于FNO和DeepONet。

Conclusion: VAE-DNN是一种高效且高精度的替代模型，适用于参数化非线性偏微分方程求解。

Abstract: We propose a trainable-by-parts surrogate model for solving forward and
inverse parameterized nonlinear partial differential equations. Like several
other surrogate and operator learning models, the proposed approach employs an
encoder to reduce the high-dimensional input $y(\bm{x})$ to a lower-dimensional
latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$. Then, a fully connected neural network is
used to map $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_y}$ to the latent space, $\bm\mu_{\bm\phi_h}$, of
the PDE solution $h(\bm{x},t)$. Finally, a decoder is utilized to reconstruct
$h(\bm{x},t)$. The innovative aspect of our model is its ability to train its
three components independently. This approach leads to a substantial decrease
in both the time and energy required for training when compared to leading
operator learning models such as FNO and DeepONet. The separable training is
achieved by training the encoder as part of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
for $y(\bm{x})$ and the decoder as part of the $h(\bm{x},t)$ VAE. We refer to
this model as the VAE-DNN model. VAE-DNN is compared to the FNO and DeepONet
models for obtaining forward and inverse solutions to the nonlinear diffusion
equation governing groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Our findings
indicate that VAE-DNN not only demonstrates greater efficiency but also
delivers superior accuracy in both forward and inverse solutions compared to
the FNO and DeepONet models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户侧KPI和监管数据的时空预测框架，用于精准预测频谱需求，优于传统ITU模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 频谱需求预测对频谱分配、监管规划和无线通信网络可持续发展至关重要，支持ITU等机构制定公平政策和满足新兴技术需求。

Method: 结合高级特征工程、相关性分析和迁移学习技术，利用用户侧KPI和监管数据建模。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，预测精度和跨区域泛化能力优于传统ITU模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为政策制定者和监管机构提供了更现实、可操作的频谱管理工具。

Abstract: Accurate spectrum demand prediction is crucial for informed spectrum
allocation, effective regulatory planning, and fostering sustainable growth in
modern wireless communication networks. It supports governmental efforts,
particularly those led by the international telecommunication union (ITU), to
establish fair spectrum allocation policies, improve auction mechanisms, and
meet the requirements of emerging technologies such as advanced 5G, forthcoming
6G, and the internet of things (IoT). This paper presents an effective
spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages crowdsourced user-side key
performance indicators (KPIs) and regulatory datasets to model and forecast
spectrum demand. The proposed methodology achieves superior prediction accuracy
and cross-regional generalizability by incorporating advanced feature
engineering, comprehensive correlation analysis, and transfer learning
techniques. Unlike traditional ITU models, which are often constrained by
arbitrary inputs and unrealistic assumptions, this approach exploits granular,
data-driven insights to account for spatial and temporal variations in spectrum
utilization. Comparative evaluations against ITU estimates, as the benchmark,
underscore our framework's capability to deliver more realistic and actionable
predictions. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our methodology,
highlighting its potential as a robust approach for policymakers and regulatory
bodies to enhance spectrum management and planning.

A key challenge for learning models from data streams is capturing relevant

intelligent data subsampling for offline learning, and argue for an
information-theoretic method centred on reducing uncertainty in downstream
predictions of interest. Empirically, we demonstrate that this
prediction-oriented approach performs better than a previously proposed
information-theoretic technique on two widely studied problems. At the same
time, we highlight that reliably achieving strong performance in practice
requires careful model design.

Conclusion: 智能子采样是高效训练的有效方法，显著减少数据需求和能耗。

Abstract: With the end of Moore's law and Dennard scaling, efficient training
increasingly requires rethinking data volume. Can we train better models with
significantly less data via intelligent subsampling? To explore this, we
develop SICKLE, a sparse intelligent curation framework for efficient learning,
featuring a novel maximum entropy (MaxEnt) sampling approach, scalable
training, and energy benchmarking. We compare MaxEnt with random and
phase-space sampling on large direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets of
turbulence. Evaluating SICKLE at scale on Frontier, we show that subsampling as
a preprocessing step can improve model accuracy and substantially lower energy
consumption, with reductions of up to 38x observed in certain cases.

Result: 在T1DM控制任务中，血糖违规率从22.4%降至10.8%。

Conclusion: 为未来安全且时间敏感的医疗强化学习奠定了基础，但尚未用于临床部署。

Abstract: Managing physiological variables within clinically safe target zones is a
central challenge in healthcare, particularly for chronic conditions such as
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Reinforcement learning (RL) offers promise for
personalising treatment, but struggles with the delayed and heterogeneous
effects of interventions. We propose a novel RL framework to study and support
decision-making in T1DM technologies, such as automated insulin delivery. Our
approach captures the complex temporal dynamics of treatment by unifying two
control modalities: \textit{impulse control} for discrete, fast-acting
interventions (e.g., insulin boluses), and \textit{switching control} for
longer-acting treatments and regime shifts. The core of our method is a
constrained Markov decision process augmented with physiological state
features, enabling safe policy learning under clinical and resource
constraints. The framework incorporates biologically realistic factors,
including insulin decay, leading to policies that better reflect real-world
therapeutic behaviour. While not intended for clinical deployment, this work
establishes a foundation for future safe and temporally-aware RL in healthcare.
We provide theoretical guarantees of convergence and demonstrate empirical
improvements in a stylised T1DM control task, reducing blood glucose level
violations from 22.4\% (state-of-the-art) to as low as 10.8\%.

Motivation: 葡萄物候的准确预测对葡萄园管理至关重要，但传统生物物理模型精度不足，深度学习因数据稀疏性受限。

Method: 采用多任务学习与循环神经网络结合，参数化可微分生物物理模型，实现跨品种共享学习。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上验证，显著优于传统生物物理模型和基线深度学习方法。

Conclusion: 混合方法在预测物候阶段和其他作物状态变量上表现出色，为精细葡萄园管理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of grape phenology is essential for timely vineyard
management decisions, such as scheduling irrigation and fertilization, to
maximize crop yield and quality. While traditional biophysical models
calibrated on historical field data can be used for season-long predictions,
they lack the precision required for fine-grained vineyard management. Deep
learning methods are a compelling alternative but their performance is hindered
by sparse phenology datasets, particularly at the cultivar level. We propose a
hybrid modeling approach that combines multi-task learning with a recurrent
neural network to parameterize a differentiable biophysical model. By using
multi-task learning to predict the parameters of the biophysical model, our
approach enables shared learning across cultivars while preserving biological
structure, thereby improving the robustness and accuracy of predictions.
Empirical evaluation using real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that
our method significantly outperforms both conventional biophysical models and
baseline deep learning approaches in predicting phenological stages, as well as
other crop state variables such as cold-hardiness and wheat yield.

Motivation: 基于距离的分类器（如k近邻和支持向量机）在实践中需要可解释性，但现有可解释AI方法通常依赖模型的结构（如神经网络的层）。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 发现基于距离的分类器中隐藏的神经网络结构（线性检测单元与非线性池化层的组合），并应用分层相关传播（LRP）技术。

Result: 通过定量评估，新解释方法优于多个基线方法，并通过两个实际用例展示了其有用性。

Conclusion: 本文为基于距离的分类器提供了有效的可解释性方法，扩展了可解释AI的应用范围。

Abstract: Distance-based classifiers, such as k-nearest neighbors and support vector
machines, continue to be a workhorse of machine learning, widely used in
science and industry. In practice, to derive insights from these models, it is
also important to ensure that their predictions are explainable. While the
field of Explainable AI has supplied methods that are in principle applicable
to any model, it has also emphasized the usefulness of latent structures (e.g.
the sequence of layers in a neural network) to produce explanations. In this
paper, we contribute by uncovering a hidden neural network structure in
distance-based classifiers (consisting of linear detection units combined with
nonlinear pooling layers) upon which Explainable AI techniques such as
layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) become applicable. Through quantitative
evaluations, we demonstrate the advantage of our novel explanation approach
over several baselines. We also show the overall usefulness of explaining
distance-based models through two practical use cases.

Result: 主动学习能提升性能，但提升速度较慢；性能最终趋于平缓，可能与数据点选择顺序有关。

Conclusion: 主动学习有效，但性能提升呈线性平缓趋势，与数据点选择数量相关。

Abstract: This paper examines the effectiveness of combining active learning and
transfer learning for anomaly detection in cross-domain time-series data. Our
results indicate that there is an interaction between clustering and active
learning and in general the best performance is achieved using a single cluster
(in other words when clustering is not applied). Also, we find that adding new
samples to the training set using active learning does improve model
performance but that in general, the rate of improvement is slower than the
results reported in the literature suggest. We attribute this difference to an
improved experimental design where distinct data samples are used for the
sampling and testing pools. Finally, we assess the ceiling performance of
transfer learning in combination with active learning across several datasets
and find that performance does initially improve but eventually begins to tail
off as more target points are selected for inclusion in training. This tail-off
in performance may indicate that the active learning process is doing a good
job of sequencing data points for selection, pushing the less useful points
towards the end of the selection process and that this tail-off occurs when
these less useful points are eventually added. Taken together our results
indicate that active learning is effective but that the improvement in model
performance follows a linear flat function concerning the number of points
selected and labelled.

Conclusion: 该方法为无法直接求解的宏观PDE提供了有效的解决方案算子，适用于复杂场景的人群模拟。

Abstract: Bridging the microscopic and the macroscopic modelling scales in crowd
dynamics constitutes an important, open challenge for systematic numerical
analysis, optimization, and control. We propose a combined manifold and machine
learning approach to learn the discrete evolution operator for the emergent
crowd dynamics in latent spaces from high-fidelity agent-based simulations. The
proposed framework builds upon our previous works on next-generation
Equation-free algorithms on learning surrogate models for high-dimensional and
multiscale systems. Our approach is a four-stage one, explicitly conserving the
mass of the reconstructed dynamics in the high-dimensional space. In the first
step, we derive continuous macroscopic fields (densities) from discrete
microscopic data (pedestrians' positions) using KDE. In the second step, based
on manifold learning, we construct a map from the macroscopic ambient space
into the latent space parametrized by a few coordinates based on POD of the
corresponding density distribution. The third step involves learning
reduced-order surrogate ROMs in the latent space using machine learning
techniques, particularly LSTMs networks and MVARs. Finally, we reconstruct the
crowd dynamics in the high-dimensional space in terms of macroscopic density
profiles. We demonstrate that the POD reconstruction of the density
distribution via SVD conserves the mass. With this "embed->learn in latent
space->lift back to the ambient space" pipeline, we create an effective
solution operator of the unavailable macroscopic PDE for the density evolution.
For our illustrations, we use the Social Force Model to generate data in a
corridor with an obstacle, imposing periodic boundary conditions. The numerical
results demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and generalizability, thus
allowing for fast and accurate modelling/simulation of crowd dynamics from
agent-based simulations.

Result: 发现模型大小和训练集规模存在阈值，超过后模型能学习估计转移概率；更复杂的状态编码能提升对未见结构的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Transformer能通过下一个词预测任务学习上下文相关的算法，且模型规模和训练数据量是关键因素。

Abstract: We investigate the capacity of transformers to learn algorithms involving
their context while solely being trained using next token prediction. We set up
Markov chains with random transition matrices and we train transformers to
predict the next token. Matrices used during training and test are different
and we show that there is a threshold in transformer size and in training set
size above which the model is able to learn to estimate the transition
probabilities from its context instead of memorizing the training patterns.
Additionally, we show that more involved encoding of the states enables more
robust prediction for Markov chains with structures different than those seen
during training.

TL;DR: FairPOT是一种基于最优运输的模型无关后处理框架，通过选择性调整风险评分分布，实现公平性与AUC性能的可调权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如医疗、金融、刑事司法）中，公平性通常基于风险评分而非二元结果，但严格公平性要求可能显著降低AUC性能。

Method: 提出FairPOT框架，利用最优运输选择性调整劣势群体的评分分布（如top-lambda分位数），并扩展至部分AUC设置。

Result: 实验表明，FairPOT在全局和部分AUC场景中优于现有方法，常以轻微AUC损失或性能提升实现公平性改善。

Conclusion: FairPOT的计算效率和实用性使其成为现实部署的有前景解决方案。

Abstract: Fairness metrics utilizing the area under the receiver operator
characteristic curve (AUC) have gained increasing attention in high-stakes
domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. In these domains,
fairness is often evaluated over risk scores rather than binary outcomes, and a
common challenge is that enforcing strict fairness can significantly degrade
AUC performance. To address this challenge, we propose Fair Proportional
Optimal Transport (FairPOT), a novel, model-agnostic post-processing framework
that strategically aligns risk score distributions across different groups
using optimal transport, but does so selectively by transforming a controllable
proportion, i.e., the top-lambda quantile, of scores within the disadvantaged
group. By varying lambda, our method allows for a tunable trade-off between
reducing AUC disparities and maintaining overall AUC performance. Furthermore,
we extend FairPOT to the partial AUC setting, enabling fairness interventions
to concentrate on the highest-risk regions. Extensive experiments on synthetic,
public, and clinical datasets show that FairPOT consistently outperforms
existing post-processing techniques in both global and partial AUC scenarios,
often achieving improved fairness with slight AUC degradation or even positive
gains in utility. The computational efficiency and practical adaptability of
FairPOT make it a promising solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper introduces BubbleONet, an operator learning model designed to map
pressure profiles from an input function space to corresponding bubble radius
responses. BubbleONet is built upon the physics-informed deep operator network
(PI-DeepONet) framework, leveraging DeepONet's powerful universal approximation
capabilities for operator learning alongside the robust physical fidelity
provided by the physics-informed neural networks. To mitigate the inherent
spectral bias in deep learning, BubbleONet integrates the Rowdy adaptive
activation function, enabling improved representation of high-frequency
features. The model is evaluated across various scenarios, including: (1)
Rayleigh-Plesset equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
(2) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with a single initial radius,
and (3) Keller-Miksis equation based bubble dynamics with multiple initial
radii. Moreover, the performance of single-step versus two-step training
techniques for BubbleONet is investigated. The results demonstrate that
BubbleONet serves as a promising surrogate model for simulating bubble
dynamics, offering a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
numerical solvers.

TL;DR: PrivCLIP是一个动态、用户可控的隐私保护框架，通过多模态对比学习实现少量样本的敏感活动检测，并生成隐私合规数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代传感系统中用户隐私需求多样且动态变化，现有方法依赖静态标签或大量训练数据，缺乏灵活性和用户控制。

Method: PrivCLIP结合多模态对比学习，将IMU数据与自然语言描述对齐，通过语言引导的数据转换模块（IMU-GPT）生成隐私合规数据。

Result: 在多个活动识别数据集上，PrivCLIP在隐私保护和数据效用方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PrivCLIP提供了一种灵活、用户可控的隐私保护解决方案，适用于动态变化的隐私需求。

Abstract: User-controllable privacy is important in modern sensing systems, as privacy
preferences can vary significantly from person to person and may evolve over
time. This is especially relevant in devices equipped with Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) sensors, such as smartphones and wearables, which continuously
collect rich time-series data that can inadvertently expose sensitive user
behaviors. While prior work has proposed privacy-preserving methods for sensor
data, most rely on static, predefined privacy labels or require large
quantities of private training data, limiting their adaptability and user
agency. In this work, we introduce PrivCLIP, a dynamic, user-controllable,
few-shot privacy-preserving sensing framework. PrivCLIP allows users to specify
and modify their privacy preferences by categorizing activities as sensitive
(black-listed), non-sensitive (white-listed), or neutral (gray-listed).
Leveraging a multimodal contrastive learning approach, PrivCLIP aligns IMU
sensor data with natural language activity descriptions in a shared embedding
space, enabling few-shot detection of sensitive activities. When a
privacy-sensitive activity is identified, the system uses a language-guided
activity sanitizer and a motion generation module (IMU-GPT) to transform the
original data into a privacy-compliant version that semantically resembles a
non-sensitive activity. We evaluate PrivCLIP on multiple human activity
recognition datasets and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms baseline
methods in terms of both privacy protection and data utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务设置下，合并异构LoRA适配器会导致任务干扰，影响下游任务性能。

Method: 在文本级，通过嵌入空间聚类训练样本并训练专用LoRA适配器；在参数级，引入联合CP分解分离任务特定和共享因子。

Result: 在Phi-3和Mistral-7B上分别提升1.4%和2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA有效减少任务干扰，提升LLM适应能力。

Abstract: Despite the success of the monolithic dense paradigm of large language models
(LLMs), the LoRA adapters offer an efficient solution by fine-tuning small
task-specific modules and merging them with the base model. However, in
multi-task settings, merging LoRA adapters trained on heterogeneous sources
frequently causes \textit{task interference}, degrading downstream performance.
To address this, we propose a tensorized clustered LoRA (TC-LoRA) library
targeting to address the task interference at the \textit{text-level} and
\textit{parameter-level}. At the \textit{text-level}, we cluster the training
samples in the embedding space to capture input-format similarities, then train
a specialized LoRA adapter for each cluster. At the \textit{parameter-level},
we introduce a joint Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition that disentangles
task-specific and shared factors across LoRA adapters. This joint factorization
preserves essential knowledge while reducing cross-task interference. Extensive
experiments on out-of-domain zero-shot and skill-composition tasks-including
reasoning, question answering, and coding. Compared to strong SVD-based
baselines, TC-LoRA achieves +1.4\% accuracy on Phi-3 and +2.3\% on Mistral-7B
(+2.3\%), demonstrating the effectiveness of TC-LoRA in LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm that allows
multiple participants to train a shared model by exchanging model updates
instead of their raw data. However, its performance is degraded compared to
centralized approaches due to data heterogeneity across clients. While
contrastive learning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this, our
theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental conflict: its asymptotic assumptions
of an infinite number of negative samples are violated in finite-sample regime
of federated learning. To address this issue, we introduce Decoupled
Contrastive Learning for Federated Learning (DCFL), a novel framework that
decouples the existing contrastive loss into two objectives. Decoupling the
loss into its alignment and uniformity components enables the independent
calibration of the attraction and repulsion forces without relying on the
asymptotic assumptions. This strategy provides a contrastive learning method
suitable for federated learning environments where each client has a small
amount of data. Our experimental results show that DCFL achieves stronger
alignment between positive samples and greater uniformity between negative
samples compared to existing contrastive learning methods. Furthermore,
experimental results on standard benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet, demonstrate that DCFL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
federated learning methods.

TL;DR: 本文对TensorFlow和PyTorch两大深度学习框架进行了全面比较，重点分析了它们的易用性、性能和部署权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨TensorFlow和PyTorch在编程范式、开发体验、训练和推理性能、部署灵活性等方面的差异，帮助开发者选择适合的工具。

Method: 通过对比编程范式、性能基准测试、部署工具和生态系统支持，结合实际应用案例进行分析。

Result: PyTorch在研究领域因其简单性和灵活性更受欢迎，而TensorFlow在生产和企业环境中提供了更成熟的生态系统。

Conclusion: 理解两者的权衡是选择合适框架的关键，未来需进一步优化执行模式、跨框架互操作性和编译器优化。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative survey of TensorFlow and
PyTorch, the two leading deep learning frameworks, focusing on their usability,
performance, and deployment trade-offs. We review each framework's programming
paradigm and developer experience, contrasting TensorFlow's graph-based (now
optionally eager) approach with PyTorch's dynamic, Pythonic style. We then
compare model training speeds and inference performance across multiple tasks
and data regimes, drawing on recent benchmarks and studies. Deployment
flexibility is examined in depth - from TensorFlow's mature ecosystem
(TensorFlow Lite for mobile/embedded, TensorFlow Serving, and JavaScript
support) to PyTorch's newer production tools (TorchScript compilation, ONNX
export, and TorchServe). We also survey ecosystem and community support,
including library integrations, industry adoption, and research trends (e.g.,
PyTorch's dominance in recent research publications versus TensorFlow's broader
tooling in enterprise). Applications in computer vision, natural language
processing, and other domains are discussed to illustrate how each framework is
used in practice. Finally, we outline future directions and open challenges in
deep learning framework design, such as unifying eager and graph execution,
improving cross-framework interoperability, and integrating compiler
optimizations (XLA, JIT) for improved speed. Our findings indicate that while
both frameworks are highly capable for state-of-the-art deep learning, they
exhibit distinct trade-offs: PyTorch offers simplicity and flexibility favored
in research, whereas TensorFlow provides a fuller production-ready ecosystem -
understanding these trade-offs is key for practitioners selecting the
appropriate tool. We include charts, code snippets, and more than 20 references
to academic papers and official documentation to support this comparative
analysis

Result: 在8个任务和54个基线模型上的实验验证了FeDaL的跨数据集泛化能力，并分析了联邦学习的扩展行为。

Conclusion: FeDaL有效解决了时间序列数据集的异构性问题，显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Dataset-wise heterogeneity introduces significant domain biases that
fundamentally degrade generalization on Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs),
yet this challenge remains underexplored. This paper rethink the development of
TSFMs using the paradigm of federated learning. We propose a novel Federated
Dataset Learning (FeDaL) approach to tackle heterogeneous time series by
learning dataset-agnostic temporal representations. Specifically, the
distributed architecture of federated learning is a nature solution to
decompose heterogeneous TS datasets into shared generalized knowledge and
preserved personalized knowledge. Moreover, based on the TSFM architecture,
FeDaL explicitly mitigates both local and global biases by adding two
complementary mechanisms: Domain Bias Elimination (DBE) and Global Bias
Elimination (GBE). FeDaL`s cross-dataset generalization has been extensively
evaluated in real-world datasets spanning eight tasks, including both
representation learning and downstream time series analysis, against 54
baselines. We further analyze federated scaling behavior, showing how data
volume, client count, and join rate affect model performance under
decentralization.

Result: QTFT在某些测试案例中优于经典TFT，其余案例中性能相当。

Conclusion: QTFT是一种可行的量子增强方案，适用于当前量子设备。

Abstract: The Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), proposed by Lim et al.
[\textit{International Journal of Forecasting}, 2021], is a state-of-the-art
attention-based deep neural network architecture specifically designed for
multi-horizon time series forecasting. It has demonstrated significant
performance improvements over existing benchmarks. In this work, we propose a
Quantum Temporal Fusion Transformer (QTFT), a quantum-enhanced hybrid
quantum-classical architecture that extends the capabilities of the classical
TFT framework. Our results demonstrate that QTFT is successfully trained on the
forecasting datasets and is capable of accurately predicting future values. In
particular, our experimental results display that in certain test cases, the
model outperforms its classical counterpart in terms of both training and test
loss, while in the remaining cases, it achieves comparable performance. A key
advantage of our approach lies in its foundation on a variational quantum
algorithm, enabling implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices without strict requirements on the number of qubits or circuit
depth.

Motivation: 探索如何利用有限数据和计算资源改进自动短答案评分，对比微调与少样本提示的效果。

Method: 评估了OpenAI的微调服务和QLORA方法，结合少样本提示，测试了Llama和OpenAI模型的性能。

Result: 微调在封闭模型中优于少样本基线，而开放权重模型需合成数据辅助才能显著提升效果。

Conclusion: 微调在封闭模型中有效，开放权重模型需更多数据支持，领域知识可能影响效果。

Abstract: Research to improve Automated Short Answer Grading has recently focused on
Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering and no- or few-shot
prompting to achieve best results. This is in contrast to the fine-tuning
approach, which has historically required large-scale compute clusters
inaccessible to most users. New closed-model approaches such as OpenAI's
fine-tuning service promise results with as few as 100 examples, while methods
using open weights such as quantized low-rank adaptive (QLORA) can be used to
fine-tune models on consumer GPUs. We evaluate both of these fine-tuning
methods, measuring their interaction with few-shot prompting for automated
short answer grading (ASAG) with structured (JSON) outputs. Our results show
that finetuning with small amounts of data has limited utility for Llama
open-weight models, but that fine-tuning methods can outperform few-shot
baseline instruction-tuned LLMs for OpenAI's closed models. While our
evaluation set is limited, we find some evidence that the observed benefits of
finetuning may be impacted by the domain subject matter. Lastly, we observed
dramatic improvement with the LLama 3.1 8B-Instruct open-weight model by
seeding the initial training examples with a significant amount of cheaply
generated synthetic training data.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习后门攻击方法通常使用固定模式或单一目标触发器，灵活性差且易被检测。

Method: FLAT通过潜在驱动的条件自编码器生成多样化的触发器，支持任意目标选择且无需重新训练。

Result: 实验表明FLAT攻击成功率高，并能抵御先进的防御机制。

Conclusion: 研究强调了联邦学习中潜在驱动多目标后门威胁的紧迫性，需开发新的防御策略。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

Result: AFMVC在公平性和聚类性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AFMVC框架在保证公平性的同时，保持了聚类性能，提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Cluster analysis is a fundamental problem in data mining and machine
learning. In recent years, multi-view clustering has attracted increasing
attention due to its ability to integrate complementary information from
multiple views. However, existing methods primarily focus on clustering
performance, while fairness-a critical concern in human-centered
applications-has been largely overlooked. Although recent studies have explored
group fairness in multi-view clustering, most methods impose explicit
regularization on cluster assignments, relying on the alignment between
sensitive attributes and the underlying cluster structure. However, this
assumption often fails in practice and can degrade clustering performance. In
this paper, we propose an adversarial fair multi-view clustering (AFMVC)
framework that integrates fairness learning into the representation learning
process. Specifically, our method employs adversarial training to fundamentally
remove sensitive attribute information from learned features, ensuring that the
resulting cluster assignments are unaffected by it. Furthermore, we
theoretically prove that aligning view-specific clustering assignments with a
fairness-invariant consensus distribution via KL divergence preserves
clustering consistency without significantly compromising fairness, thereby
providing additional theoretical guarantees for our framework. Extensive
experiments on data sets with fairness constraints demonstrate that AFMVC
achieves superior fairness and competitive clustering performance compared to
existing multi-view clustering and fairness-aware clustering methods.

Result: 序列化方法SMI-AW在攻击准确性和视觉相似性上优于基于令牌的方法，人类评估的攻击准确率达到75.31%。

Conclusion: VLMs存在显著的隐私风险，尤其是在广泛应用的背景下，需引起重视。

Abstract: Model inversion (MI) attacks pose significant privacy risks by reconstructing
private training data from trained neural networks. While prior works have
focused on conventional unimodal DNNs, the vulnerability of vision-language
models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct the first study
to understand VLMs' vulnerability in leaking private visual training data. To
tailored for VLMs' token-based generative nature, we propose a suite of novel
token-based and sequence-based model inversion strategies. Particularly, we
propose Token-based Model Inversion (TMI), Convergent Token-based Model
Inversion (TMI-C), Sequence-based Model Inversion (SMI), and Sequence-based
Model Inversion with Adaptive Token Weighting (SMI-AW). Through extensive
experiments and user study on three state-of-the-art VLMs and multiple
datasets, we demonstrate, for the first time, that VLMs are susceptible to
training data leakage. The experiments show that our proposed sequence-based
methods, particularly SMI-AW combined with a logit-maximization loss based on
vocabulary representation, can achieve competitive reconstruction and
outperform token-based methods in attack accuracy and visual similarity.
Importantly, human evaluation of the reconstructed images yields an attack
accuracy of 75.31\%, underscoring the severity of model inversion threats in
VLMs. Notably we also demonstrate inversion attacks on the publicly released
VLMs. Our study reveals the privacy vulnerability of VLMs as they become
increasingly popular across many applications such as healthcare and finance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been
released at https://github.com/hijih/copo-code.git.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了域偏移问题，仅需少量标注数据即可显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate solar generation prediction is essential for proper estimation of
renewable energy resources across diverse geographic locations. However,
geographical and weather features vary from location to location which
introduces domain shift - a major bottleneck to develop location-agnostic
prediction model. As a result, a machine-learning model which can perform well
to predict solar power in one location, may exhibit subpar performance in
another location. Moreover, the lack of properly labeled data and storage
issues make the task even more challenging. In order to address domain shift
due to varying weather conditions across different meteorological regions, this
paper presents a semi-supervised deep domain adaptation framework, allowing
accurate predictions with minimal labeled data from the target location. Our
approach involves training a deep convolutional neural network on a source
location's data and adapting it to the target location using a source-free,
teacher-student model configuration. The teacher-student model leverages
consistency and cross-entropy loss for semi-supervised learning, ensuring
effective adaptation without any source data requirement for prediction. With
annotation of only $20 \%$ data in the target domain, our approach exhibits an
improvement upto $11.36 \%$, $6.65 \%$, $4.92\%$ for California, Florida and
New York as target domain, respectively in terms of accuracy in predictions
with respect to non-adaptive approach.

Motivation: 解决从质谱数据生成分子结构的问题，传统方法性能有限，需要更高效的编码-解码框架。

Conclusion: 该方法为质谱数据生成分子结构的研究提供了强基线，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: A common approach to the \emph{de novo} molecular generation problem from
mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into
molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into
molecular structures. In our work, we adopt
\textsc{MIST}~\citep{MISTgoldmanAnnotatingMetaboliteMass2023} as the encoder
and \textsc{MolForge}~\citep{ucakReconstructionLosslessMolecular2023} as the
decoder, leveraging pretraining to enhance performance. Notably, pretraining
\textsc{MolForge} proves especially effective, enabling it to serve as a robust
fingerprint-to-structure decoder. Additionally, instead of passing the
probability of each bit in the fingerprint, thresholding the probabilities as a
step function helps focus the decoder on the presence of substructures,
improving recovery of accurate molecular structures even when the fingerprints
predicted by \textsc{MIST} only moderately resembles the ground truth in terms
of Tanimoto similarity. This combination of encoder and decoder results in a
tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1
28\% / top-10 36\% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra. We
position this pipeline as a strong baseline for future research in \emph{de
novo} molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

Conclusion: SAMT通过块交替更新和自适应步长，显著提升了神经网络优化的效果和效率。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks is inherently a nonconvex optimization
problem, yet standard approaches such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
require simultaneous updates to all parameters, often leading to unstable
convergence and high computational cost. To address these issues, we propose a
novel method, Stochastic Alternating Minimization with Trainable Step Sizes
(SAMT), which updates network parameters in an alternating manner by treating
the weights of each layer as a block. By decomposing the overall optimization
into sub-problems corresponding to different blocks, this block-wise
alternating strategy reduces per-step computational overhead and enhances
training stability in nonconvex settings. To fully leverage these benefits,
inspired by meta-learning, we proposed a novel adaptive step size strategy to
incorporate into the sub-problem solving steps of alternating updates. It
supports different types of trainable step sizes, including but not limited to
scalar, element-wise, row-wise, and column-wise, enabling adaptive step size
selection tailored to each block via meta-learning. We further provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed algorithm, establishing its
optimization soundness. Extensive experiments for multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that SAMT achieves better generalization performance with fewer
parameter updates compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
effectiveness and potential in neural network optimization.

Result: 实验表明，CRA能有效减少奖励欺骗，提高数学问题解决的最终准确性，且无需修改策略模型或重新训练PRM。

Conclusion: CRA通过因果推断方法解决了奖励欺骗问题，为复杂任务推理提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: External reasoning systems combine language models with process reward models
(PRMs) to select high-quality reasoning paths for complex tasks such as
mathematical problem solving. However, these systems are prone to reward
hacking, where high-scoring but logically incorrect paths are assigned high
scores by the PRMs, leading to incorrect answers. From a causal inference
perspective, we attribute this phenomenon primarily to the presence of
confounding semantic features. To address it, we propose Causal Reward
Adjustment (CRA), a method that mitigates reward hacking by estimating the true
reward of a reasoning path. CRA trains sparse autoencoders on the PRM's
internal activations to recover interpretable features, then corrects
confounding by using backdoor adjustment. Experiments on math solving datasets
demonstrate that CRA mitigates reward hacking and improves final accuracy,
without modifying the policy model or retraining PRM.

Result: 实验表明，S$f$-AC在分布近似和MuJoCo任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: S$f$-AC是首个实用的基于对称散度的BRPO算法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper introduces symmetric divergences to behavior regularization policy
optimization (BRPO) to establish a novel offline RL framework. Existing methods
focus on asymmetric divergences such as KL to obtain analytic regularized
policies and a practical minimization objective. We show that symmetric
divergences do not permit an analytic policy as regularization and can incur
numerical issues as loss. We tackle these challenges by the Taylor series of
$f$-divergence. Specifically, we prove that an analytic policy can be obtained
with a finite series. For loss, we observe that symmetric divergences can be
decomposed into an asymmetry and a conditional symmetry term, Taylor-expanding
the latter alleviates numerical issues. Summing together, we propose Symmetric
$f$ Actor-Critic (S$f$-AC), the first practical BRPO algorithm with symmetric
divergences. Experimental results on distribution approximation and MuJoCo
verify that S$f$-AC performs competitively.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) powered agents have emerged as effective planners
for Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems. While most existing AutoML

to explore improving data quality, rather than model architecture, as a
potentially fruitful direction for AutoML on time series data. We propose
DCATS, a Data-Centric Agent for Time Series. DCATS leverages metadata
accompanying time series to clean data while optimizing forecasting
performance. We evaluated DCATS using four time series forecasting models on a

Abstract: Angle estimation is an important step in the Doppler ultrasound clinical
workflow to measure blood velocity. It is widely recognized that incorrect
angle estimation is a leading cause of error in Doppler-based blood velocity
measurements. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for
automated Doppler angle estimation. The approach was developed using 2100 human
carotid ultrasound images including image augmentation. Five pre-trained models
were used to extract images features, and these features were passed to a
custom shallow network for Doppler angle estimation. Independently,
measurements were obtained by a human observer reviewing the images for
comparison. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the automated and manual
angle estimates ranged from 3.9{\deg} to 9.4{\deg} for the models evaluated.
Furthermore, the MAE for the best performing model was less than the acceptable
clinical Doppler angle error threshold thus avoiding misclassification of
normal velocity values as a stenosis. The results demonstrate potential for
applying a deep-learning based technique for automated ultrasound Doppler angle
estimation. Such a technique could potentially be implemented within the
imaging software on commercial ultrasound scanners.

TL;DR: T3Time是一种新型的三模态框架，通过时间、频谱和提示分支解决多变量时间序列预测中的局限性，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉多变量时间序列的复杂关系时存在局限性，如依赖固定归纳偏差、忽略变量间交互或使用静态融合策略。

Method: 提出T3Time框架，包含时间、频谱和提示分支，采用门控机制动态优先选择特征，并自适应聚合跨模态对齐头。

Result: 在基准数据集上，T3Time平均减少MSE 3.28%和MAE 2.29%，在少样本学习中表现优异。

Conclusion: T3Time通过动态特征选择和跨模态对齐，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) seeks to model temporal dynamics
among variables to predict future trends. Transformer-based models and large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise due to their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and patterns. However, current methods often rely on
rigid inductive biases, ignore intervariable interactions, or apply static
fusion strategies that limit adaptability across forecast horizons. These
limitations create bottlenecks in capturing nuanced, horizon-specific
relationships in time-series data. To solve this problem, we propose T3Time, a
novel trimodal framework consisting of time, spectral, and prompt branches,
where the dedicated frequency encoding branch captures the periodic structures
along with a gating mechanism that learns prioritization between temporal and
spectral features based on the prediction horizon. We also proposed a mechanism
which adaptively aggregates multiple cross-modal alignment heads by dynamically
weighting the importance of each head based on the features. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average reduction of 3.28%
in MSE and 2.29% in MAE. Furthermore, it shows strong generalization in
few-shot learning settings: with 5% training data, we see a reduction in MSE
and MAE by 4.13% and 1.91%, respectively; and with 10% data, by 3.62% and 1.98%
on average. Code - https://github.com/monaf-chowdhury/T3Time/

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为Mockingbird的框架，通过让大语言模型（LLMs）扮演特定角色并自我反思，将其应用于通用机器学习任务。评估表明，该方法在常见任务上表现尚可，但仅靠自我反思无法超越领域特定文档和人类专家的反馈。

Motivation: 研究源于对大语言模型（LLMs）在通用机器学习任务中潜力的好奇，探索其超越聊天机器人应用的可能性。

Method: 提出Mockingbird框架，通过指令让LLMs扮演功能角色并自我反思错误以改进性能。

Result: 评估显示，LLM驱动的机器学习方法（如Mockingbird）在常见任务上表现可接受，但自我反思的效果不及领域特定文档和人类专家反馈。

Conclusion: LLMs在通用机器学习任务中具有一定潜力，但需结合领域知识和人类反馈以实现更优性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now being used with increasing frequency as
chat bots, tasked with the summarizing information or generating text and code
in accordance with user instructions. The rapid increase in reasoning
capabilities and inference speed of LLMs has revealed their remarkable
potential for applications extending beyond the domain of chat bots to general
machine learning tasks. This work is conducted out of the curiosity about such
potential. In this work, we propose a framework Mockingbird to adapt LLMs to
general machine learning tasks and evaluate its performance and scalability on
several general machine learning tasks. The core concept of this framework is
instructing LLMs to role-play functions and reflect on its mistakes to improve
itself. Our evaluation and analysis result shows that LLM-driven machine
learning methods, such as Mockingbird, can achieve acceptable results on common
machine learning tasks; however, solely reflecting on its own currently cannot
outperform the effect of domain-specific documents and feedback from human
experts.

TL;DR: VL-DAC是一种轻量级、无超参数的RL算法，通过解耦动作和价值的更新，提升了VLMs在多种任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）缺乏将视觉观察转化为语言条件动作序列的能力，而传统RL方法存在泛化性差和依赖密集奖励的问题。

Method: 提出VL-DAC算法，解耦动作令牌的PPO更新和环境步级别的价值学习，避免不稳定的权重项。

Result: 在多个模拟器中训练的VLMs在真实任务中表现显著提升（如BALROG +50%，VSI-Bench +5%，VisualWebBench +2%）。

Conclusion: VL-DAC首次证明简单RL算法可在廉价模拟器中训练VLMs，并在真实任务中取得显著效果。

Abstract: Interactive multimodal agents must convert raw visual observations into
coherent sequences of language-conditioned actions -- a capability that current
vision-language models (VLMs) still lack. Earlier reinforcement-learning (RL)
efforts could, in principle, endow VLMs with such skills, but they have seldom
tested whether the learned behaviours generalize beyond their training
simulators, and they depend either on brittle hyperparameter tuning or on
dense-reward environments with low state variability. We introduce
Vision-Language Decoupled Actor-Critic (VL-DAC), a lightweight,
hyperparameter-free RL algorithm. VL-DAC applies PPO updates to action tokens
while learning value only at the environment-step level: an arrangement, to our
knowledge, not previously explored for large VLMs or LLMs. This simple
decoupling removes unstable weighting terms and yields faster, more reliable
convergence. Training a single VLM with VL-DAC in one inexpensive simulator at
a time (MiniWorld, Gym-Cards, ALFWorld, or WebShop) already produces policies
that generalize widely: +50\% relative on BALROG (game-centric agentic
control), +5\% relative on the hardest part of VSI-Bench (spatial planning),
and +2\% on VisualWebBench (web navigation), all without degrading general
image understanding accuracy. These results provide the first evidence that a
simple RL algorithm can train VLMs entirely in cheap synthetic worlds while
delivering measurable gains on real-image agentic, spatial-reasoning, and
web-navigation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重显著性的两阶段高效机器遗忘方法（WSS-CL），用于图像分类，显著缩小了与“精确”遗忘的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器遗忘方法在精确性、稳定性和跨领域适用性方面存在挑战，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 遗忘阶段通过最大化KL散度实现高效遗忘；2) 对抗微调阶段通过对比学习最大化特征空间中遗忘与保留数据的距离。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在遗忘效果和性能损失方面优于现有方法，适用于监督和自监督场景。

Conclusion: WSS-CL方法在机器遗忘中表现出高效性和实用性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Machine unlearning, the efficient deletion of the impact of specific data in
a trained model, remains a challenging problem. Current machine unlearning
approaches that focus primarily on data-centric or weight-based strategies
frequently encounter challenges in achieving precise unlearning, maintaining
stability, and ensuring applicability across diverse domains. In this work, we
introduce a new two-phase efficient machine unlearning method for image
classification, in terms of weight saliency, leveraging weight saliency to
focus the unlearning process on critical model parameters. Our method is called
weight saliency soft-guided contrastive learning for efficient machine
unlearning image classification (WSS-CL), which significantly narrows the
performance gap with "exact" unlearning. First, the forgetting stage maximizes
kullback-leibler divergence between output logits and aggregated pseudo-labels
for efficient forgetting in logit space. Next, the adversarial fine-tuning
stage introduces contrastive learning in a self-supervised manner. By using
scaled feature representations, it maximizes the distance between the forgotten
and retained data samples in the feature space, with the forgotten and the
paired augmented samples acting as positive pairs, while the retained samples
act as negative pairs in the contrastive loss computation. Experimental
evaluations reveal that our proposed method yields much-improved unlearning
efficacy with negligible performance loss compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, indicative of its usability in supervised and self-supervised
settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过标记分类（正负标记）和遗忘机制来优化监督微调（SFT）的方法，以提高模型性能并增强响应多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调的效果依赖于数据质量和数量，若处理不当可能导致性能提升有限甚至下降。本文旨在减少这种依赖性。

Method: 将语料库中的标记分为正负两类，正标记按常规训练，负标记通过遗忘机制处理以减少无效信息的学习。

Result: 实验表明，该遗忘机制不仅提升了模型整体性能，还促进了更丰富的响应多样性。

Conclusion: 标记分类和遗忘机制能有效优化监督微调，帮助模型更精准地学习有用信息。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a critical role for pretrained large
language models (LLMs), notably enhancing their capacity to acquire
domain-specific knowledge while preserving or potentially augmenting their
general-purpose capabilities. However, the efficacy of SFT hinges on data
quality as well as data volume, otherwise it may result in limited performance
gains or even degradation relative to the associated baselines. To mitigate
such reliance, we suggest categorizing tokens within each corpus into two parts
-- positive and negative tokens -- based on whether they are useful to improve
model performance. Positive tokens can be trained in common ways, whereas
negative tokens, which may lack essential semantics or be misleading, should be
explicitly forgotten. Overall, the token categorization facilitate the model to
learn less informative message, and the forgetting process shapes a knowledge
boundary to guide the model on what information to learn more precisely. We
conduct experiments on well-established benchmarks, finding that this
forgetting mechanism not only improves overall model performance and also
facilitate more diverse model responses.

TL;DR: PrivDFS是一种新的私有推理范式，通过分布式特征共享解决隐私与效率的权衡问题，同时通过扩展方案增强隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云机器学习服务（MLaaS）在处理敏感数据时存在隐私问题，现有私有推理方法在隐私和效率之间存在矛盾。

Method: PrivDFS将输入特征分区并分发到非共谋服务器进行独立推理，客户端安全聚合结果。扩展方案包括对抗训练（PrivDFS-AT）和用户特定密钥（PrivDFS-KD）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CelebA上，PrivDFS在保持隐私的同时减少客户端计算100倍，且无精度损失。扩展方案对攻击具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrivDFS提供了一种高效且隐私保护的私有推理方案，适用于敏感数据场景。

Abstract: Cloud-based Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) raises serious privacy
concerns when handling sensitive client data. Existing Private Inference (PI)
methods face a fundamental trade-off between privacy and efficiency:
cryptographic approaches offer strong protection but incur high computational
overhead, while efficient alternatives such as split inference expose
intermediate features to inversion attacks. We propose PrivDFS, a new paradigm
for private inference that replaces a single exposed representation with
distributed feature sharing. PrivDFS partitions input features on the client
into multiple balanced shares, which are distributed to non-colluding,
non-communicating servers for independent partial inference. The client
securely aggregates the servers' outputs to reconstruct the final prediction,
ensuring that no single server observes sufficient information to compromise
input privacy. To further strengthen privacy, we propose two key extensions:
PrivDFS-AT, which uses adversarial training with a diffusion-based proxy
attacker to enforce inversion-resistant feature partitioning, and PrivDFS-KD,
which leverages user-specific keys to diversify partitioning policies and
prevent query-based inversion generalization. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and
CelebA demonstrate that PrivDFS achieves privacy comparable to deep split
inference while cutting client computation by up to 100 times with no accuracy
loss, and that the extensions remain robust against both diffusion-based
in-distribution and adaptive attacks.

Motivation: 解决高维系统在非均匀时间点观测数据建模中的挑战，避免降维方法对动态和瞬态行为的简化。

Method: 扩展了无模拟分数和流匹配方法到多边际设置，利用测度值样条增强对不规则时间点的鲁棒性，并通过分数匹配防止高维空间过拟合。

Result: 在合成和基准数据集（如基因表达数据和图像进展任务）上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MMSFM方法在高维数据建模中表现出色，适用于非均匀时间点观测的复杂系统。

Abstract: Modeling the evolution of high-dimensional systems from limited snapshot
observations at irregular time points poses a significant challenge in
quantitative biology and related fields. Traditional approaches often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, which can oversimplify the dynamics and
fail to capture critical transient behaviors in non-equilibrium systems. We
present Multi-Marginal Stochastic Flow Matching (MMSFM), a novel extension of
simulation-free score and flow matching methods to the multi-marginal setting,
enabling the alignment of high-dimensional data measured at non-equidistant
time points without reducing dimensionality. The use of measure-valued splines
enhances robustness to irregular snapshot timing, and score matching prevents
overfitting in high-dimensional spaces. We validate our framework on several
synthetic and benchmark datasets, including gene expression data collected at
uneven time points and an image progression task, demonstrating the method's
versatility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多实例学习（MIL）的持续学习方法，通过选择实例和样本存储来避免灾难性遗忘，并在白血病检测中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验室和临床环境中的数据流需要持续更新机器学习模型，但现有持续学习方法在多实例学习中效果不佳。

Method: 基于实例注意力分数和距离选择样本，存储多样化的实例集，用于后续任务训练。

Result: 在白血病实验室数据上，该方法显著优于现有持续学习方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了MIL的持续学习，适用于数据分布随时间变化的场景。

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高内存和计算成本限制了实际部署，现有INT4/INT8量化方法在精度或效率上存在不足。INT6量化提供了更好的权衡，但缺乏硬件支持。

Method: FlexQ采用统一的6位权重量化，并通过层敏感分析保留8位激活。开发了高性能GPU内核，支持W6A6和W6A8表示，利用二进制张量核心（BTC）绕过INT6核心的缺失。

Result: 在LLaMA模型上，FlexQ保持了接近FP16的精度（困惑度增加不超过0.05），推理速度提升1.39倍，内存节省1.21倍。

Conclusion: FlexQ通过创新的量化方法和硬件优化，实现了高效的模型推理和内存节省，为LLMs的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance but entail
significant memory and computational costs, restricting their practical
deployment. While existing INT4/INT8 quantization reduces these costs, they
often degrade accuracy or lack optimal efficiency. INT6 quantization offers a
superior trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency, but lacks
hardware support in modern GPUs, forcing emulation via higher-precision
arithmetic units that limit acceleration.
  In this paper, we propose FlexQ, a novel post-training INT6 quantization
framework combining algorithmic innovation with system-level optimizations.
FlexQ employs uniform 6-bit weight quantization across all layers, with
adaptive retention of 8-bit activations in layers identified through layer-wise
sensitivity analysis. To maximize hardware efficiency, we develop a specialized
high-performance GPU kernel supporting matrix multiplication for W6A6 and W6A8
representations via Binary Tensor Core (BTC) equivalents, effectively bypassing
the lack of native INT6 tensor cores. Evaluations on LLaMA models show FlexQ
maintains near-FP16 accuracy, with perplexity increases of no more than 0.05.
The proposed kernel achieves an average 1.39$\times$ speedup over ABQ-LLM on
LLaMA-2-70B linear layers. End-to-end, FlexQ delivers 1.33$\times$ inference
acceleration and 1.21$\times$ memory savings over SmoothQuant. Code is released
at https://github.com/FlyFoxPlayer/FlexQ.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years,
particularly with the integration of attention-based models, leading to
significant performance gains across a variety of tasks. Parallel to this
progress, the demand for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has spurred
a growing body of research aimed at interpreting the complex decision-making
processes of these models. This systematic literature review analyzes research
published between January 2020 and early 2024 that focuses on the
explainability of multimodal models. Framed within the broader goals of XAI, we
examine the literature across multiple dimensions, including model
architecture, modalities involved, explanation algorithms and evaluation
methodologies. Our analysis reveals that the majority of studies are
concentrated on vision-language and language-only models, with attention-based
techniques being the most commonly employed for explanation. However, these
methods often fall short in capturing the full spectrum of interactions between
modalities, a challenge further compounded by the architectural heterogeneity
across domains. Importantly, we find that evaluation methods for XAI in
multimodal settings are largely non-systematic, lacking consistency,
robustness, and consideration for modality-specific cognitive and contextual
factors. Based on these findings, we provide a comprehensive set of
recommendations aimed at promoting rigorous, transparent, and standardized
evaluation and reporting practices in multimodal XAI research. Our goal is to
support future research in more interpretable, accountable, and responsible
mulitmodal AI systems, with explainability at their core.

Result: 在MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10和CelebA上，CMCFAE在重建质量、潜在空间结构和样本多样性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: CMCFAE为自编码器生成模型提供了新的增强视角，结合云模型理论和MMD正则化。

Abstract: We introduce Cloud Model Characteristic Function Auto-Encoder (CMCFAE), a
novel generative model that integrates the cloud model into the Wasserstein
Auto-Encoder (WAE) framework. By leveraging the characteristic functions of the
cloud model to regularize the latent space, our approach enables more accurate
modeling of complex data distributions. Unlike conventional methods that rely
on a standard Gaussian prior and traditional divergence measures, our method
employs a cloud model prior, providing a more flexible and realistic
representation of the latent space, thus mitigating the homogenization observed
in reconstructed samples. We derive the characteristic function of the cloud
model and propose a corresponding regularizer within the WAE framework.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on MNIST, FashionMNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CelebA demonstrate that CMCFAE outperforms existing models in
terms of reconstruction quality, latent space structuring, and sample
diversity. This work not only establishes a novel integration of cloud model
theory with MMD-based regularization but also offers a promising new
perspective for enhancing autoencoder-based generative models.

Result: 该方法能够发现现有基线遗漏的细微漏洞，成为新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 将LLM红队任务重新定义为动态、基于轨迹的过程，对AI的稳健部署至关重要。

Abstract: Red teaming is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and building trust in
current LLMs. However, current automated methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) rely on brittle prompt templates or single-turn attacks, failing to
capture the complex, interactive nature of real-world adversarial dialogues. We
propose a novel paradigm: training an AI to strategically `break' another AI.
By formalizing red teaming as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employing a
hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we effectively address the
inherent sparse reward and long-horizon challenges. Our generative agent learns
coherent, multi-turn attack strategies through a fine-grained, token-level harm
reward, enabling it to uncover subtle vulnerabilities missed by existing
baselines. This approach sets a new state-of-the-art, fundamentally reframing
LLM red teaming as a dynamic, trajectory-based process (rather than a one-step
test) essential for robust AI deployment.

Method: 方法包括比较标准Transformer、LSTM、MLP，以及改进的cisformer和extensive attention模型在任务切换（IARC任务）中的表现。

Result: 结果显示标准Transformer表现不佳，而结合extensive attention的改进模型能达到约95%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结论表明，通过比较不同注意力机制在小规模任务中的表现，可以更好地理解和改进注意力机制的设计。

Abstract: The rapid progress seen in terms of large-scale generative AI is largely
based on the attention mechanism. It is conversely non-trivial to conceive
small-scale applications for which attention-based architectures outperform
traditional approaches, such as multi-layer perceptrons or recurrent networks.
We examine this problem in the context of 'task switching'. In this framework
models work on ongoing token sequences with the current task being determined
by stochastically interspersed control tokens. We show that standard
transformers cannot solve a basic task switching reference model based on
finite domain arithmetics which contains subtasks dedicated to increment /
addition / reverse copy / context (IARC). We show that transformers, long
short-term memory recurrent networks (LSTM), and plain multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) achieve similar, but only modest prediction accuracies. We enlarge our
comparative study by including an extension of the standard transformer
architecture to its non-translational invariant counterpart, the cisformer, and
an alternative attention mechanism, extensive attention. A combination of the
latter is found to be the only model able to achieve considerable performance
levels, of around 95%. Our results indicate that the workings of attention can
be understood better, and even improved, when comparing qualitatively different
formulations in task-switching settings.

Result: 在无需微调的情况下，推理速度比传统方法提升最高4.83倍。

Conclusion: CARD框架有效解决了现有推测解码的瓶颈，显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where an extra draft model first provides multiple
draft tokens and the original target model then verifies these tokens in
parallel, has shown great power for LLM inference acceleration. However,
existing SD methods must adhere to the 'draft-then-verify' paradigm, which
forces drafting and verification processes to execute sequentially during SD,
resulting in inefficient inference performance and limiting the size of the
draft model. Furthermore, once a single token in the candidate sequence is
rejected during the drafting process, all subsequent candidate tokens must be
discarded, leading to inefficient drafting. To address these challenges, we
propose a cache-based parallel speculative decoding framework employing a
'query-and-correct' paradigm. Specifically, CARD decouples drafting and
verification: the draft model generates candidate tokens to populate a shared
cache, while the target model concurrently rectifies the draft model's
generation direction. This effectively enables the target model to perform
inference at speed approaching that of the draft model. Our approach achieves
up to 4.83 speedup over vanilla decoding without requiring fine-tuning of
either the draft or target models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GFocal通过全局和局部特征的协同学习，显著提升了物理建模和预测的准确性。

Abstract: Transformer-based neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate
solvers for partial differential equations, by leveraging the effectiveness of
Transformers for capturing long-range dependencies and global correlations,
profoundly proven in language modeling. However, existing methodologies
overlook the coordinated learning of interdependencies between local physical
details and global features, which are essential for tackling multiscale
problems, preserving physical consistency and numerical stability in long-term
rollouts, and accurately capturing transitional dynamics. In this work, we
propose GFocal, a Transformer-based neural operator method that enforces
simultaneous global and local feature learning and fusion. Global correlations
and local features are harnessed through Nystr\"{o}m attention-based
\textbf{g}lobal blocks and slices-based \textbf{focal} blocks to generate
physics-aware tokens, subsequently modulated and integrated via
convolution-based gating blocks, enabling dynamic fusion of multiscale
information. GFocal achieves accurate modeling and prediction of physical
features given arbitrary geometries and initial conditions. Experiments show
that GFocal achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 15.2\%
relative gain in five out of six benchmarks and also excels in industry-scale
simulations such as aerodynamics simulation of automotives and airfoils.

Conclusion: FedHiP通过解析解实现异构不变性，显著提升个性化联邦学习性能。

Abstract: Lately, Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a prevalent
paradigm to deliver personalized models by collaboratively training while
simultaneously adapting to each client's local applications. Existing PFL
methods typically face a significant challenge due to the ubiquitous data
heterogeneity (i.e., non-IID data) across clients, which severely hinders
convergence and degrades performance. We identify that the root issue lies in
the long-standing reliance on gradient-based updates, which are inherently
sensitive to non-IID data. To fundamentally address this issue and bridge the
research gap, in this paper, we propose a Heterogeneity-invariant Personalized
Federated learning scheme, named FedHiP, through analytical (i.e., closed-form)
solutions to avoid gradient-based updates. Specifically, we exploit the trend
of self-supervised pre-training, leveraging a foundation model as a frozen
backbone for gradient-free feature extraction. Following the feature extractor,
we further develop an analytic classifier for gradient-free training. To
support both collective generalization and individual personalization, our
FedHiP scheme incorporates three phases: analytic local training, analytic
global aggregation, and analytic local personalization. The closed-form
solutions of our FedHiP scheme enable its ideal property of heterogeneity
invariance, meaning that each personalized model remains identical regardless
of how non-IID the data are distributed across all other clients. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our FedHiP
scheme, outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines by at least 5.79%-20.97%
in accuracy.

Result: 低能源负担群体节省显著，高能源负担群体几乎无节省，因其将节省用于改善热舒适度。

Conclusion: 需综合考虑气候影响和能源政策的公平性，制定更广泛的评估框架。

Abstract: Reducing domestic energy demand is central to climate mitigation and fuel
poverty strategies, yet the impact of energy efficiency interventions is highly
heterogeneous. Using a causal machine learning model trained on nationally
representative data of the English housing stock, we estimate average and
conditional treatment effects of wall insulation on gas consumption, focusing
on distributional effects across energy burden subgroups. While interventions
reduce gas demand on average (by as much as 19 percent), low energy burden
groups achieve substantial savings, whereas those experiencing high energy
burdens see little to no reduction. This pattern reflects a
behaviourally-driven mechanism: households constrained by high costs-to-income
ratios (e.g. more than 0.1) reallocate savings toward improved thermal comfort
rather than lowering consumption. Far from wasteful, such responses represent
rational adjustments in contexts of prior deprivation, with potential
co-benefits for health and well-being. These findings call for a broader
evaluation framework that accounts for both climate impacts and the equity
implications of domestic energy policy.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种更全面的模型评估方法，不仅关注错误数量，还关注错误类型和影响。

Abstract: A common use of machine learning (ML) models is predicting the class of a
sample. Object detection is an extension of classification that includes
localization of the object via a bounding box within the sample.
Classification, and by extension object detection, is typically evaluated by
counting a prediction as incorrect if the predicted label does not match the
ground truth label. This pass/fail scoring treats all misclassifications as
equivalent. In many cases, class labels can be organized into a class taxonomy
with a hierarchical structure to either reflect relationships among the data or
operator valuation of misclassifications. When such a hierarchical structure
exists, hierarchical scoring metrics can return the model performance of a
given prediction related to the distance between the prediction and the ground
truth label. Such metrics can be viewed as giving partial credit to predictions
instead of pass/fail, enabling a finer-grained understanding of the impact of
misclassifications. This work develops hierarchical scoring metrics varying in
complexity that utilize scoring trees to encode relationships between class
labels and produce metrics that reflect distance in the scoring tree. The
scoring metrics are demonstrated on an abstract use case with scoring trees
that represent three weighting strategies and evaluated by the kind of errors
discouraged. Results demonstrate that these metrics capture errors with finer
granularity and the scoring trees enable tuning. This work demonstrates an
approach to evaluating ML performance that ranks models not only by how many
errors are made but by the kind or impact of errors. Python implementations of
the scoring metrics will be available in an open-source repository at time of
publication.

Motivation: 现有LLMs和传统强化学习智能体在因果推理上表现不足，依赖虚假关联而非真正的因果理解。

Method: 提出Causal Reflection框架，动态建模因果关系，并定义Reflect机制以修正模型。

Result: 框架为智能体提供了适应、自我修正和解释因果的能力。

Conclusion: Causal Reflection为智能体在动态环境中的因果推理奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有Transformer和CNN模型在多元时间序列分类中计算量大、频率多样性有限和参数需求高的问题。

Method: 采用对称有限脉冲响应（FIR）滤波器，在多个时间尺度上独立处理每个通道，避免通道间卷积，降低模型复杂度和大小。

Conclusion: PRISM结合经典信号处理和现代深度学习，为多元时间序列分类提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series classification is pivotal in domains ranging from
wearable sensing to biomedical monitoring. Despite recent advances,
Transformer- and CNN-based models often remain computationally heavy, offer
limited frequency diversity, and require extensive parameter budgets. We
propose PRISM (Per-channel Resolution-Informed Symmetric Module), a
convolutional-based feature extractor that applies symmetric
finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters at multiple temporal scales,
independently per channel. This multi-resolution, per-channel design yields
highly frequency-selective embeddings without any inter-channel convolutions,
greatly reducing model size and complexity. Across human-activity, sleep-stage
and biomedical benchmarks, PRISM, paired with lightweight classification heads,
matches or outperforms leading CNN and Transformer baselines, while using
roughly an order of magnitude fewer parameters and FLOPs. By uniting classical
signal processing insights with modern deep learning, PRISM offers an accurate,
resource-efficient solution for multivariate time-series classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有联邦交通预测方法因通信开销大导致的训练延迟问题，同时满足隐私约束。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，Fed-CI在RMSE、MAE和MAPE上分别提升8%、14%和16%，同时显著降低通信成本。

Conclusion: Fed-CI是一种高效、隐私安全的联邦交通预测框架，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In recent years, traffic prediction has achieved remarkable success and has
become an integral component of intelligent transportation systems. However,
traffic data is typically distributed among multiple data owners, and privacy
constraints prevent the direct utilization of these isolated datasets for
traffic prediction. Most existing federated traffic prediction methods focus on
designing communication mechanisms that allow models to leverage information
from other clients in order to improve prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, such
approaches often incur substantial communication overhead, and the resulting
transmission delays significantly slow down the training process. As the volume
of traffic data continues to grow, this issue becomes increasingly critical,
making the resource consumption of current methods unsustainable. To address
this challenge, we propose a novel variable relationship modeling paradigm for
federated traffic prediction, termed the Channel-Independent Paradigm(CIP).
Unlike traditional approaches, CIP eliminates the need for inter-client
communication by enabling each node to perform efficient and accurate
predictions using only local information. Based on the CIP, we further develop
Fed-CI, an efficient federated learning framework, allowing each client to
process its own data independently while effectively mitigating the information
loss caused by the lack of direct data sharing among clients. Fed-CI
significantly reduces communication overhead, accelerates the training process,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance while complying with privacy
regulations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that Fed-CI consistently outperforms existing methods across all datasets and
federated settings. It achieves improvements of 8%, 14%, and 16% in RMSE, MAE,
and MAPE, respectively, while also substantially reducing communication costs.

Conclusion: 该框架为理解和预测个人信息泄露风险提供了有效工具。

Abstract: It is difficult for individuals and organizations to protect personal
information without a fundamental understanding of relative privacy risks. By
analyzing over 5,000 empirical identity theft and fraud cases, this research
identifies which types of personal data are exposed, how frequently exposures
occur, and what the consequences of those exposures are. We construct an
Identity Ecosystem graph--a foundational, graph-based model in which nodes
represent personally identifiable information (PII) attributes and edges
represent empirical disclosure relationships between them (e.g., the
probability that one PII attribute is exposed due to the exposure of another).
Leveraging this graph structure, we develop a privacy risk prediction framework
that uses graph theory and graph neural networks to estimate the likelihood of
further disclosures when certain PII attributes are compromised. The results
show that our approach effectively answers the core question: Can the
disclosure of a given identity attribute possibly lead to the disclosure of
another attribute?

Motivation: 传统GFM主要关注节点特征的跨域泛化，但缺乏结构信息的跨域一致性。GraphProp旨在通过结构泛化提升模型性能。

Method: GraphProp分两阶段训练：1）通过预测图不变量训练结构GFM；2）利用结构GFM的表示作为位置编码，结合节点属性和标签训练综合GFM。

Result: 实验表明，GraphProp在监督学习和少样本学习中显著优于竞争对手，尤其在无节点属性的图上表现突出。

Conclusion: GraphProp通过结构泛化显著提升了GFM的跨域性能，尤其在缺乏节点属性的场景下效果显著。

Abstract: This work focuses on training graph foundation models (GFMs) that have strong
generalization ability in graph-level tasks such as graph classification.
Effective GFM training requires capturing information consistent across
different domains. We discover that graph structures provide more consistent
cross-domain information compared to node features and graph labels. However,
traditional GFMs primarily focus on transferring node features from various
domains into a unified representation space but often lack structural
cross-domain generalization. To address this, we introduce GraphProp, which
emphasizes structural generalization. The training process of GraphProp
consists of two main phases. First, we train a structural GFM by predicting
graph invariants. Since graph invariants are properties of graphs that depend
only on the abstract structure, not on particular labellings or drawings of the
graph, this structural GFM has a strong ability to capture the abstract
structural information and provide discriminative graph representations
comparable across diverse domains. In the second phase, we use the
representations given by the structural GFM as positional encodings to train a
comprehensive GFM. This phase utilizes domain-specific node attributes and
graph labels to further improve cross-domain node feature generalization. Our
experiments demonstrate that GraphProp significantly outperforms the
competitors in supervised learning and few-shot learning, especially in
handling graphs without node attributes.

Result: 二维网络能预测动态位移和焊点生长，且在实验置信区间内，支持从钢到铝的焊接阶段转移。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在工业应用中快速、基于模型的质量控制的强大潜力。

Abstract: Resistance spot welding is the dominant joining process for the body-in-white
in the automotive industry, where the weld nugget diameter is the key quality
metric. Its measurement requires destructive testing, limiting the potential
for efficient quality control. Physics-informed neural networks were
investigated as a promising tool to reconstruct internal process states from
experimental data, enabling model-based and non-invasive quality assessment in
aluminum spot welding. A major challenge is the integration of real-world data
into the network due to competing optimization objectives. To address this, we
introduce two novel training strategies. First, experimental losses for dynamic
displacement and nugget diameter are progressively included using a fading-in
function to prevent excessive optimization conflicts. We also implement a
custom learning rate scheduler and early stopping based on a rolling window to
counteract premature reduction due to increased loss magnitudes. Second, we
introduce a conditional update of temperature-dependent material parameters via
a look-up table, activated only after a loss threshold is reached to ensure
physically meaningful temperatures. An axially symmetric two-dimensional model
was selected to represent the welding process accurately while maintaining
computational efficiency. To reduce computational burden, the training
strategies and model components were first systematically evaluated in one
dimension, enabling controlled analysis of loss design and contact models. The
two-dimensional network predicts dynamic displacement and nugget growth within
the experimental confidence interval, supports transferring welding stages from
steel to aluminum, and demonstrates strong potential for fast, model-based
quality control in industrial applications.

Abstract: We propose a framework for learning maps between probability distributions
that broadly generalizes the time dynamics of flow and diffusion models. To
enable this, we generalize stochastic interpolants by replacing the scalar time
variable with vectors, matrices, or linear operators, allowing us to bridge
probability distributions across multiple dimensional spaces. This approach
enables the construction of versatile generative models capable of fulfilling
multiple tasks without task-specific training. Our operator-based interpolants
not only provide a unifying theoretical perspective for existing generative
models but also extend their capabilities. Through numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the zero-shot efficacy of our method on conditional generation and
inpainting, fine-tuning and posterior sampling, and multiscale modeling,
suggesting its potential as a generic task-agnostic alternative to specialized
models.

Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this
paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network
Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an

Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When

mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while
preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection has garnered considerable attention across
diverse domains. While existing methods often fail to capture the underlying
mechanisms behind anomaly generation in time series data. In addition, time
series anomaly detection often faces several data-related inherent challenges,
i.e., label scarcity, data imbalance, and complex multi-periodicity. In this
paper, we leverage causal tools and introduce a new causality-based framework,
CaPulse, which tunes in to the underlying causal pulse of time series data to
effectively detect anomalies. Concretely, we begin by building a structural
causal model to decipher the generation processes behind anomalies. To tackle
the challenges posed by the data, we propose Periodical Normalizing Flows with
a novel mask mechanism and carefully designed periodical learners, creating a
periodicity-aware, density-based anomaly detection approach. Extensive
experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that CaPulse consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC improvements of 3% to 17%, with
enhanced interpretability.

recently, existing methods face key challenges including limited supervision
from sparse connectivity, sensitivity to initialization, and poor
generalization under distribution shifts. We explore pretraining as a solution
to address these challenges. Unlike node classification, LP is inherently a
pairwise task, which requires the integration of both node- and edge-level
information. In this work, we present the first systematic study on the
transferability of these distinct modules and propose a late fusion strategy to
effectively combine their outputs for improved performance. To handle the
diversity of pretraining data and avoid negative transfer, we introduce a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that captures distinct patterns in separate
experts, facilitating seamless application of the pretrained model on diverse
downstream datasets. For fast adaptation, we develop a parameter-efficient
tuning strategy that allows the pretrained model to adapt to unseen datasets
with minimal computational overhead. Experiments on 16 datasets across two
domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on low-resource link prediction while obtaining
competitive results compared to end-to-end trained methods, with over 10,000x
lower computational overhead.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效算法，用于在高斯分布下学习单指数模型，并在对抗性标签噪声存在时实现常数因子近似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高斯分布和对抗性标签噪声下学习单指数模型的问题，填补现有方法在激活函数类别和近似效果上的不足。

Method: 开发了一种新的优化框架，通过直接利用问题结构、高斯空间性质和单调函数的规律性，识别有用的向量场来指导算法更新。

Result: 算法首次实现了对所有具有有界矩的单调激活函数（包括Lipschitz函数和半空间等不连续函数）的常数因子近似。

Conclusion: 该研究为单指数模型的学习提供了高效且广泛适用的解决方案，突破了传统梯度方法的限制。

Abstract: We consider the basic problem of learning Single-Index Models with respect to
the square loss under the Gaussian distribution in the presence of adversarial
label noise. Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning task, achieving a constant factor approximation,
that succeeds for the class of {\em all} monotone activations with bounded
moment of order $2 + \zeta,$ for $\zeta > 0.$ This class in particular includes
all monotone Lipschitz functions and even discontinuous functions like
(possibly biased) halfspaces. Prior work for the case of unknown activation
either does not attain constant factor approximation or succeeds for a
substantially smaller family of activations. The main conceptual novelty of our
approach lies in developing an optimization framework that steps outside the
boundaries of usual gradient methods and instead identifies a useful vector
field to guide the algorithm updates by directly leveraging the problem
structure, properties of Gaussian spaces, and regularity of monotone functions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the critical role of trust and fatigue in human-cobot
collaborative order picking, framing the challenge within the scope of
Logistics 5.0 -- the implementation of human-robot symbiosis in smart
logistics. We propose a dynamic, leader-follower Stackelberg game to model this
interaction, where utility functions explicitly account for human fatigue and
trust. Through agent-based simulations, we demonstrate that while a naive model
leads to a "trust death spiral," a refined trust model creates a "trust synergy
cycle," increasing productivity by nearly 100 percent. Finally, we show that a
cobot equipped with a proactive Trust-Repair Protocol can overcome system
brittleness, reducing trust recovery time after a severe failure by over 75
percent compared to a non-adaptive model. Our findings provide a framework for
designing intelligent cobot behaviors that fulfill the Industry 5.0 pillars of
human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态适应框架，用于处理多智能体路径规划中因故障导致的延迟问题，避免完全重新规划，通过本地协调和路径调整保证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体路径规划（MAPF）中，智能体可能因故障延迟，传统完全重新规划方法计算成本高，需一种高效动态适应方案。

Method: 提出动态适应框架，包括两种协议：主协议通过本地协调限制故障影响，次协议将计算任务转移到网络节点以减轻智能体负担。

Result: 证明主协议在k次故障后，总时间增加不超过k次额外转向；次协议确保鲁棒性且无需增强智能体计算能力。

Conclusion: 协议为多智能体导航提供了一种实用、可扩展的解决方案，有效应对智能体故障问题。

Abstract: In Multiagent Path Finding (MAPF), the goal is to compute efficient,
collision-free paths for multiple agents navigating a network from their
sources to targets, minimizing the schedule's makespan-the total time until all
agents reach their destinations. We introduce a new variant that formally
models scenarios where some agents may experience delays due to malfunctions,
posing significant challenges for maintaining optimal schedules.
  Recomputing an entirely new schedule from scratch after each malfunction is
often computationally infeasible. To address this, we propose a framework for
dynamic schedule adaptation that does not rely on full replanning. Instead, we
develop protocols enabling agents to locally coordinate and adjust their paths
on the fly. We prove that following our primary communication protocol, the
increase in makespan after k malfunctions is bounded by k additional turns,
effectively limiting the impact of malfunctions on overall efficiency.
Moreover, recognizing that agents may have limited computational capabilities,
we also present a secondary protocol that shifts the necessary computations
onto the network's nodes, ensuring robustness without requiring enhanced agent
processing power. Our results demonstrate that these protocols provide a
practical, scalable approach to resilient multiagent navigation in the face of
agent failures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统在动态环境中因静态架构和固定任务分配策略而表现不佳，需要更灵活的解决方案。

Method: DRAMA采用模块化架构，分为控制平面和工作平面，通过亲和性机制实现松散耦合的任务分配。

Result: DRAMA能够实时监控和动态调整任务分配，确保在动态环境中的持续协作和任务执行。

Conclusion: DRAMA为动态环境中的多智能体协作提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant effectiveness in
addressing complex problems through coordinated collaboration among
heterogeneous agents. However, real-world environments and task specifications
are inherently dynamic, characterized by frequent changes, uncertainty, and
variability. Despite this, most existing MAS frameworks rely on static
architectures with fixed agent capabilities and rigid task allocation
strategies, which greatly limits their adaptability to evolving conditions.
This inflexibility poses substantial challenges for sustaining robust and
efficient multi-agent cooperation in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose DRAMA: a Dynamic and Robust
Allocation-based Multi-Agent System designed to facilitate resilient
collaboration in rapidly changing environments. DRAMA features a modular
architecture with a clear separation between the control plane and the worker
plane. Both agents and tasks are abstracted as resource objects with
well-defined lifecycles, while task allocation is achieved via an
affinity-based, loosely coupled mechanism. The control plane enables real-time
monitoring and centralized planning, allowing flexible and efficient task
reassignment as agents join, depart, or become unavailable, thereby ensuring
continuous and robust task execution. The worker plane comprises a cluster of
autonomous agents, each with local reasoning, task execution, the ability to
collaborate, and the capability to take over unfinished tasks from other agents
when needed.

Conclusion: 该模型通过位置信息实现稳健对齐，适用于机器人和集体动力学领域。

Abstract: This paper presents a position-based flocking model for interacting agents,
balancing cohesion-separation and alignment to achieve stable collective
motion. The model modifies a velocity-based approach by approximating velocity
differences using initial and current positions, introducing a threshold weight
to ensure sustained alignment. Simulations with 50 agents in 2D demonstrate
that the position-based model produces stronger alignment and more rigid and
compact formations compared to the velocity-based model. The alignment metric
and separation distances highlight the efficacy of the proposed model in
achieving robust flocking behavior. The model's use of positions ensures robust
alignment, with applications in robotics and collective dynamics.

Motivation: 旨在为用户提供一种能动态量化视频内容与其定义主题相关性的工具，满足对视频内容深度分析的需求。

Method: 采用多模态分析管道，结合视觉和ASR提取的文本信息，通过两阶段评分机制（直接相关性和上下文相关性）评估视频片段。

Result: 输出带注释的视频，可视化相关性评分，并提供详细分析日志。

Conclusion: LUST框架能有效量化视频内容与用户定义主题的相关性，支持动态叙事理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Learned User Significance Tracker (LUST), a
framework designed to analyze video content and quantify the thematic relevance
of its segments in relation to a user-provided textual description of
significance. LUST leverages a multi-modal analytical pipeline, integrating
visual cues from video frames with textual information extracted via Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) from the audio track. The core innovation lies in a
hierarchical, two-stage relevance scoring mechanism employing Large Language
Models (LLMs). An initial "direct relevance" score, $S_{d,i}$, assesses
individual segments based on immediate visual and auditory content against the
theme. This is followed by a "contextual relevance" score, $S_{c,i}$, that
refines the assessment by incorporating the temporal progression of preceding
thematic scores, allowing the model to understand evolving narratives. The LUST
framework aims to provide a nuanced, temporally-aware measure of user-defined
significance, outputting an annotated video with visualized relevance scores
and comprehensive analytical logs.

Result: 在Ref-AVSBench和R²-AVSBench上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TGS-Agent通过显式推理和多模态分析，提升了任务性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at

Method: 利用LiDAR和相机传感器的语义特征，结合局部球查询注意力机制，降低计算复杂度，提升插值和外推精度。

Result: 在越野数据集上表现优于基线方法，计算复杂度降低17%，同时保持地形精度。

Conclusion: 神经过程为复杂越野环境中的地形建模提供了一种高效且表达力强的方法。

Abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately
estimate changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the
corresponding uncertainties. Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays
a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable
maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They
are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands,
underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when
learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs
with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we
propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing
elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and
camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in
unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism
to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\%
while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method
on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from
trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over
baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and
expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

Conclusion: CP-Gen是一种高效的数据生成方法，能够显著提升机器人策略的泛化能力和成功率。

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC)

objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the

However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the

gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with
the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

Conclusion: DRIVE框架高效、可解释且鲁棒，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 行为自适应规划在复杂、高风险环境中具有显著优势，为机器人探索提供了鲁棒且风险敏感的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.

Abstract: Tactile gesture recognition systems play a crucial role in Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) by enabling intuitive communication between humans and
robots. The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine
learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the
pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some
gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by
tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to
improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses
solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In
particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in
the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional
information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce
similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the
proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a
classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information
achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one
trained on standard tactile images.

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models
operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical
findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the
importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for
future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task
agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and
reasoning behaviors, are available at:

Conclusion: 触觉伴侣机器人可提升放松技术的治疗效果。

Abstract: Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders are taught a range of strategies to
navigate situations of heightened anxiety. Techniques such as deep breathing
and repetition of mantras are commonly employed, as they are known to be
calming and reduce elevated heart rates. Although these strategies are often
effective, their successful application relies on prior training of the
children for successful use when faced with challenging situations. This paper
investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation
technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the
user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's
attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children
who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children
(age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a
within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile
interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was
found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01)
compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect
across all participants. These results suggest that tactile companion robots
have the potential to enhance the therapeutic value of relaxation techniques.

Motivation: 物理机器人运动规划中，理论模型因现实物理和控制器不确定性而产生误差，需改进规划器以应对这一问题。

Method: 在KEASL规划器中引入三种随机控制器行为采样方法，并在真实和模拟环境中进行实验验证。

Result: 随机采样使轨迹更保守，降低碰撞概率；与基线规划相比，碰撞预测更接近，但基线搜索成功率下降。

Conclusion: 随机控制器采样能有效减少碰撞风险，但需权衡规划成功率。

Abstract: Mobile robot motion planners rely on theoretical models to predict how the
robot will move through the world. However, when deployed on a physical robot,
these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in
how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we
address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic
controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work,
we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using
two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a
full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data
found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to
more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood
when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning
with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions
becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline
search.

Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to
fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable
and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory
planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods
with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The
framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph
neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like
longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary
contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a
linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce
computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping
constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning
horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly
smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,
achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,
thereby confirming real-time capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航任务局限于预定义对象或指令跟随，无法满足真实场景中复杂开放需求，因此需要一种能理解高级指令并实现开放词汇对象定位的方法。

Method: 采用分层框架$NavA^3$，全局策略利用Reasoning-VLM解析指令并整合全局3D场景，局部策略通过NaviAfford模型（PointingVLM）实现开放词汇对象定位。

Result: 实验表明$NavA^3$在导航性能上达到SOTA，能成功完成复杂环境中的长时程导航任务。

Conclusion: $NavA^3$为通用嵌入式导航提供了新方向，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability of embodied intelligence,
enabling robots to move and interact within physical environments. However,
existing navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or
instruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in
real-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires
understanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object
navigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods
struggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level
human instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this
paper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:
global and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning
capabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and
integrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and
navigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local
policy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware
object affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides
robust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise
goal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation
performance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across
different robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for
universal embodied navigation. The dataset and code will be made available.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

Abstract: How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic
navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified
in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a
modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal
Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge
about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information
effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph
representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises
spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each
describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be
automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment,
e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to
new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot
robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot
over diverse goals, environments, and robot embodiments.

Abstract: Physicians routinely assess respiratory sounds during the diagnostic process,
providing insight into the condition of a patient's airways. In recent years,
AI-based diagnostic systems operating on respiratory sounds, have demonstrated
success in respiratory disease detection. These systems represent a crucial
advancement in early and accessible diagnosis which is essential for timely
treatment. However, label and data scarcity remain key challenges, especially
for conditions beyond COVID-19, limiting diagnostic performance and reliable
evaluation. In this paper, we propose CoughViT, a novel pre-training framework
for learning general-purpose cough sound representations, to enhance diagnostic
performance in tasks with limited data. To address label scarcity, we employ
masked data modelling to train a feature encoder in a self-supervised learning
manner. We evaluate our approach against other pre-training strategies on three
diagnostically important cough classification tasks. Experimental results show
that our representations match or exceed current state-of-the-art supervised
audio representations in enhancing performance on downstream tasks.

Result: 可解释模型比黑盒模型更鲁棒，且能达到对抗训练模型的鲁棒性水平，但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 可解释性深度模型在鲁棒性方面优于黑盒模型，且计算效率更高。

Abstract: One of the desired key properties of deep learning models is the ability to
generalise to unseen samples. When provided with new samples that are
(perceptually) similar to one or more training samples, deep learning models
are expected to produce correspondingly similar outputs. Models that succeed in
predicting similar outputs for similar inputs are often called robust. Deep
learning models, on the other hand, have been shown to be highly vulnerable to
minor (adversarial) perturbations of the input, which manage to drastically
change a model's output and simultaneously expose its reliance on spurious
correlations. In this work, we investigate whether inherently interpretable
deep models, i.e., deep models that were designed to focus more on meaningful
and interpretable features, are more robust to irrelevant perturbations in the
data, compared to their black-box counterparts. We test our hypothesis by
comparing the robustness of an interpretable and a black-box music emotion
recognition (MER) model when challenged with adversarial examples. Furthermore,
we include an adversarially trained model, which is optimised to be more
robust, in the comparison. Our results indicate that inherently more
interpretable models can indeed be more robust than their black-box
counterparts, and achieve similar levels of robustness as adversarially trained
models, at lower computational cost.

Conclusion: MiDashengLM为音频理解提供了高效、透明的解决方案，推动了开放音频语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on
closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and
accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language
model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the
use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset.
MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At
its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder,
specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively.
Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions,
fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation,
enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly,
MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT)
and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models. Checkpoints are

Conclusion: EFIN是高效且性能优越的LLM-ASR训练策略，并提供了扩展规律指导。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) achieves
strong performance but often incurs high computational costs. This work
investigates how to obtain the best LLM-ASR performance efficiently. Through
comprehensive and controlled experiments, we find that pretraining the speech
encoder before integrating it with the LLM leads to significantly better
scaling efficiency than the standard practice of joint post-training of
LLM-ASR. Based on this insight, we propose a new multi-stage LLM-ASR training
strategy, EFIN: Encoder First Integration. Among all training strategies
evaluated, EFIN consistently delivers better performance (relative to 21.1%
CERR) with significantly lower computation budgets (49.9% FLOPs). Furthermore,
we derive a scaling law that approximates ASR error rates as a computation
function, providing practical guidance for LLM-ASR scaling.

Abstract: Paralinguistic vocalizations-including non-verbal sounds like laughter and
breathing, as well as lexicalized interjections such as "uhm" and "oh"-are
integral to natural spoken communication. Despite their importance in conveying
affect, intent, and interactional cues, such cues remain largely overlooked in
conventional automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS)
systems. We present NVSpeech, an integrated and scalable pipeline that bridges
the recognition and synthesis of paralinguistic vocalizations, encompassing
dataset construction, ASR modeling, and controllable TTS. (1) We introduce a
manually annotated dataset of 48,430 human-spoken utterances with 18 word-level
paralinguistic categories. (2) We develop the paralinguistic-aware ASR model,
which treats paralinguistic cues as inline decodable tokens (e.g., "You're so
funny [Laughter]"), enabling joint lexical and non-verbal transcription. This
model is then used to automatically annotate a large corpus, the first
large-scale Chinese dataset of 174,179 utterances (573 hours) with word-level
alignment and paralingustic cues. (3) We finetune zero-shot TTS models on both
human- and auto-labeled data to enable explicit control over paralinguistic
vocalizations, allowing context-aware insertion at arbitrary token positions
for human-like speech synthesis. By unifying the recognition and generation of
paralinguistic vocalizations, NVSpeech offers the first open, large-scale,
word-level annotated pipeline for expressive speech modeling in Mandarin,
integrating recognition and synthesis in a scalable and controllable manner.

### [338] [Do GNN-based QEC Decoders Require Classical Knowledge? Evaluating the Efficacy of Knowledge Distillation from MWPM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03782)
*Ryota Ikeda*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 比较了两种基于GAT架构的量子纠错解码器模型，发现知识蒸馏并未显著提升性能，表明GNN可直接从硬件数据中高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索知识蒸馏是否能在量子纠错解码器中提升GNN性能。

Method: 比较纯数据驱动模型与结合MWPM理论知识的蒸馏模型。

Result: 蒸馏模型测试精度与基线相近，但训练更慢且耗时增加五倍。

Conclusion: 现代GNN可直接从硬件数据中高效学习，无需理论模型指导。

Abstract: The performance of decoders in Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is key to
realizing practical quantum computers. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies
are not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring
theoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect
Matching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can
effectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by
rigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)
architecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first
is a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,
while the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the
theoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from
Google, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the
knowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training
loss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of
approximately five. This result suggests that modern GNN architectures possess
a high capacity to efficiently learn complex error correlations directly from
real hardware data, without guidance from approximate theoretical models.

Motivation: 尽管GNN解码器在量子纠错中表现出色，但其对对抗性扰动的鲁棒性尚未充分研究，这限制了其在容错量子计算中的可靠性。

Method: 使用RL代理作为对手，寻找最小的症状修改以使解码器误分类，并应用于Google Quantum AI的实验表面代码数据训练的图注意力网络（GAT）解码器。

Result: RL代理成功识别了关键漏洞，以最少的比特翻转实现了高攻击成功率；对抗训练显著提升了解码器的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过自动化漏洞发现和针对性再训练的迭代过程，为开发更可靠的神经网络解码器提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful, data-driven approach
for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding, capable of learning complex noise
characteristics directly from syndrome data. However, the robustness of these
decoders against subtle, adversarial perturbations remains a critical open
question. This work introduces a novel framework to systematically probe the
vulnerabilities of a GNN decoder using a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. The
RL agent is trained as an adversary with the goal of finding minimal syndrome
modifications that cause the decoder to misclassify. We apply this framework to
a Graph Attention Network (GAT) decoder trained on experimental surface code
data from Google Quantum AI. Our results show that the RL agent can
successfully identify specific, critical vulnerabilities, achieving a high
attack success rate with a minimal number of bit flips. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the decoder's robustness can be significantly enhanced through
adversarial training, where the model is retrained on the adversarial examples
generated by the RL agent. This iterative process of automated vulnerability
discovery and targeted retraining presents a promising methodology for
developing more reliable and robust neural network decoders for fault-tolerant
quantum computing.

Motivation: 量子算法在模拟复杂分子系统方面仍处于早期阶段，超越经典方法的目标尚远。因此，探索混合量子-经典算法以在NISQ硬件上实现实用优势成为研究动机。

Method: 研究比较了纯经典的E(3)-等变消息传递机器学习势（MLP）与混合量子-经典MLP的性能。在混合架构中，消息传递层的每个读出被替换为VQC。

Result: 分子动力学模拟表明，使用VQC的混合MLP能够准确再现高温结构和热力学性质，展示了NISQ兼容算法在材料建模中的优势。

Conclusion: 研究证明混合量子-经典算法在特定场景下优于纯经典方法，为近期量子优势的实现提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for simulating large and complex molecular systems are
still in their infancy, and surpassing state-of-the-art classical techniques
remains an ever-receding goal post. A promising avenue of inquiry in the
meanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical
algorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum
circuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
hardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical
processor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor
executes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and
expressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant
message-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid
quantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties
of liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the
message-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations
driven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature
structural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs. These findings
demonstrate a concrete scenario in which NISQ-compatible HQC algorithm could
deliver a measurable benefit over the best available classical alternative,
suggesting a viable pathway toward near-term quantum advantage in materials
modeling.

Motivation: 探索近期量子算法在动态卫星网络路由中的潜力，评估其实际应用效果。

Method: 比较了静态量子优化器（VQE、QAOA）和量子强化学习（QRL）在无噪声模拟中的表现。

Result: 静态优化器无法解决简单的4节点最短路径问题，QRL在动态8节点环境中表现与随机行为无异。

Conclusion: 量子算法在通信网络中仍面临关键障碍，需解决优化难题和学习不稳定性才能实现优势。

Abstract: Applying near-term variational quantum algorithms to the problem of dynamic
satellite network routing represents a promising direction for quantum
computing. In this work, we provide a critical evaluation of two major
approaches: static quantum optimizers such as the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for
offline route computation, and Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) methods for
online decision-making. Using ideal, noise-free simulations, we find that these
algorithms face significant challenges. Specifically, static optimizers are
unable to solve even a classically easy 4-node shortest path problem due to the
complexity of the optimization landscape. Likewise, a basic QRL agent based on
policy gradient methods fails to learn a useful routing strategy in a dynamic
8-node environment and performs no better than random actions. These negative
findings highlight key obstacles that must be addressed before quantum
algorithms can offer real advantages in communication networks. We discuss the
underlying causes of these limitations, including barren plateaus and learning
instability, and suggest future research directions to overcome them.

Conclusion: 研究建立了量子电路计算、量子复杂度和拓扑量子序机器学习关键概念与工具之间的联系。

Abstract: Inspired by the close relationship between Kolmogorov complexity and
unsupervised machine learning, we explore quantum circuit complexity, an
important concept in quantum computation and quantum information science, as a
pivot to understand and to build interpretable and efficient unsupervised
machine learning for topological order in quantum many-body systems. To span a
bridge from conceptual power to practical applicability, we present two
theorems that connect Nielsen's quantum circuit complexity for the quantum path
planning between two arbitrary quantum many-body states with fidelity change
and entanglement generation, respectively. Leveraging these connections,
fidelity-based and entanglement-based similarity measures or kernels, which are
more practical for implementation, are formulated. Using the two proposed
kernels, numerical experiments targeting the unsupervised clustering of quantum
phases of the bond-alternating XXZ spin chain, the ground state of Kitaev's
toric code and random product states, are conducted, demonstrating their
superior performance. Relations with classical shadow tomography and shadow
kernel learning are also discussed, where the latter can be naturally derived
and understood from our approach. Our results establish connections between key
concepts and tools of quantum circuit computation, quantum complexity, and
machine learning of topological quantum order.

Conclusion: 量子模块的有效性高度依赖于具体任务和架构设计，反映了模型大小、参数化策略和时间建模能力之间的权衡。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the performance of classical and quantum-inspired
sequential models in forecasting univariate time series of incoming SMS
activity (SMS-in) using the Milan Telecommunication Activity Dataset. Due to
data completeness limitations, we focus exclusively on the SMS-in signal for
each spatial grid cell. We compare five models, LSTM (baseline), Quantum LSTM
(QLSTM), Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), Quantum Receptance Weighted
Key-Value (QRWKV), and Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP), under varying
input sequence lengths (4, 8, 12, 16, 32 and 64). All models are trained to
predict the next 10-minute SMS-in value based solely on historical values
within a given sequence window. Our findings indicate that different models
exhibit varying sensitivities to sequence length, suggesting that quantum
enhancements are not universally advantageous. Rather, the effectiveness of
quantum modules is highly dependent on the specific task and architectural
design, reflecting inherent trade-offs among model size, parameterization
strategies, and temporal modeling capabilities.

Result: 实验表明，PLA能高效攻击黑盒T2I模型的安全机制，成功率高于现有方法。

Conclusion: PLA为黑盒T2I模型的安全漏洞提供了新视角，需警惕模型生成的不当内容。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前AI编码助手（如GitHub Copilot）的安全性在高风险领域（如网络安全）中仍不确定，现有测试工具无法覆盖真实漏洞。

Method: ASTRA分三个阶段工作：构建领域知识图谱、自适应探索目标模型的输入空间和推理过程、生成高质量违规案例以改进模型对齐。

Result: 在两大评估领域中，ASTRA比现有技术多发现11-66%的问题，并生成更有效的对齐训练测试案例（提升17%）。

Conclusion: ASTRA在构建更安全的AI系统方面具有实际价值，尤其在发现和修复复杂漏洞方面表现优异。

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software
development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in
high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on
fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world
vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to
systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security
guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured
domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known
weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target
model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial
exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration,
guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality
violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods,
ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually
ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain
knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two
major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing
techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment
training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

TL;DR: SenseCrypt是一种基于敏感性的选择性同态加密框架，用于在跨设备联邦学习中平衡安全性和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统选择性同态加密方法在异构数据场景下性能下降，导致客户端延迟和开销增加。

Method: 通过隐私保护方法聚类相似数据分布的客户端，设计评分机制确定加密比例，并优化参数选择以最小化开销和最大化安全性。

Result: 实验表明，SenseCrypt在保持安全性和模型精度的同时，训练时间比传统方法减少58.4%-88.7%。

Conclusion: SenseCrypt有效解决了跨设备联邦学习中的安全性和效率问题。

Abstract: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) prevails in securing Federated Learning (FL), but
suffers from high overhead and adaptation cost. Selective HE methods, which
partially encrypt model parameters by a global mask, are expected to protect
privacy with reduced overhead and easy adaptation. However, in cross-device
scenarios with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, traditional
Selective HE methods deteriorate client straggling, and suffer from degraded HE
overhead reduction performance. Accordingly, we propose SenseCrypt, a
Sensitivity-guided selective Homomorphic EnCryption framework, to adaptively
balance security and HE overhead per cross-device FL client. Given the
observation that model parameter sensitivity is effective for measuring
clients' data distribution similarity, we first design a privacy-preserving
method to respectively cluster the clients with similar data distributions.
Then, we develop a scoring mechanism to deduce the straggler-free ratio of
model parameters that can be encrypted by each client per cluster. Finally, for
each client, we formulate and solve a multi-objective model parameter selection
optimization problem, which minimizes HE overhead while maximizing model
security without causing straggling. Experiments demonstrate that SenseCrypt
ensures security against the state-of-the-art inversion attacks, while
achieving normal model accuracy as on IID data, and reducing training time by
58.4%-88.7% as compared to traditional HE methods.

Conclusion: 选择性加密可降低计算开销并保持攻击韧性，需根据具体情况选择加密策略。

Abstract: Gradient inversion attacks pose significant privacy threats to distributed
training frameworks such as federated learning, enabling malicious parties to
reconstruct sensitive local training data from gradient communications between
clients and an aggregation server during the aggregation process. While
traditional encryption-based defenses, such as homomorphic encryption, offer
strong privacy guarantees without compromising model utility, they often incur
prohibitive computational overheads. To mitigate this, selective encryption has
emerged as a promising approach, encrypting only a subset of gradient data
based on the data's significance under a certain metric. However, there have
been few systematic studies on how to specify this metric in practice. This
paper systematically evaluates selective encryption methods with different
significance metrics against state-of-the-art attacks. Our findings demonstrate
the feasibility of selective encryption in reducing computational overhead
while maintaining resilience against attacks. We propose a distance-based
significance analysis framework that provides theoretical foundations for
selecting critical gradient elements for encryption. Through extensive
experiments on different model architectures (LeNet, CNN, BERT, GPT-2) and
attack types, we identify gradient magnitude as a generally effective metric
for protection against optimization-based gradient inversions. However, we also
observe that no single selective encryption strategy is universally optimal
across all attack scenarios, and we provide guidelines for choosing appropriate
strategies for different model architectures and privacy requirements.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a deep learning framework that
integrates the governing equations underlying data into a loss function. In
this study, we consider the problem of estimating state variables and
parameters in epidemiological models governed by ordinary differential
equations using PINNs. In practice, not all trajectory data corresponding to
the population described by models can be measured. Learning PINNs to estimate
the unmeasured state variables and epidemiological parameters using partial
measurements is challenging.
  Accordingly, we introduce the concept of algebraic observability of the state
variables. Specifically, we propose augmenting the unmeasured data based on
algebraic observability analysis. The validity of the proposed method is
demonstrated through numerical experiments under three scenarios in the context
of epidemiological modelling. Specifically, given noisy and partial
measurements, the accuracy of unmeasured states and parameter estimation of the
proposed method is shown to be higher than that of the conventional methods.
The proposed method is also shown to be effective in practical scenarios, such
as when the data corresponding to certain variables cannot be reconstructed
from the measurements.

ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the
latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the
year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal

variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical
coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models
combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models

cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision
support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,
and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,
attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing
challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of
interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient

Motivation: 视网膜血管分割和动静脉分类对诊断系统性和眼部疾病至关重要，但现有方法将任务分为三个独立的二元任务，忽略了血管结构间的内在耦合关系。

Method: 设计了Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss以增强血管、动脉和静脉预测的一致性，并引入intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss提取更精细的特征表示。

Result: 在RITE、LES-AV和HRF三个公开数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 新方法通过考虑血管结构的耦合关系和引入正则化项，显著提升了视网膜动静脉分类的准确性。

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for
the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying
segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction
of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity,
which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive
retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are
time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional
Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this
challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods
all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary
tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical
structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall
retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it,
we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce
the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions,
avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks.
Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level
contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained
representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been
achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV
and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期准确检测骨折对治疗至关重要，但传统X光片解读耗时且易出错，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用改进的VGG-19模型，结合CLAHE、Otsu阈值和Canny边缘检测等预处理技术，并引入Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 模型分类准确率达99.78%，AUC为1.00，部署为实时Web应用，诊断反馈仅需0.5秒。

Conclusion: 该框架提供高效、可靠且可解释的骨折检测方案，提升诊断效率和患者护理质量。

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating
treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and
outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone
task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of
radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,
typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to
clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated
framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our
needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,
and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to
facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable
AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making
process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the
model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further
clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where
healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic
feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model
attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it
exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable
solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for
diagnoses and better patient care.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了视觉语义密度，显著改善了医学图像与诊断报告的对齐效果，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing
multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning
medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high
SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this
paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment
effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level
vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to
differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical
structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling
method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging
VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This
process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in
abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of
abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures
the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate
alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two
chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,
MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across
multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average
AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning
capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for
various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a
non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across
different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the
influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent
literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on
reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the
need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound
shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional
neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal
ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input
images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw
radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach
to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with
different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant
differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,
regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly
improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach
can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed
radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches
could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing
steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable
clinical elasticity assessments.

Motivation: 现有CutMix方法在医学图像分割中表现优异，但存在操作僵化和特征一致性不足的问题。

Method: M$^3$HL包含两部分：1) M$^3$：基于MIM的动态掩码增强数据；2) HL：高低层次特征一致性正则化框架。

Result: 在ACDC和LA数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: M$^3$HL通过动态掩码和特征一致性显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant
potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible
manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency
constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix
with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned
challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data
augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image
Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically
adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for
collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between
labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization
framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between
unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative
feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA
datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/PHPJava666/M3HL

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive
procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning
can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting
analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from
healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare
three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional
machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the
recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw
temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow
that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they
exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods
significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with
balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for
continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted
from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning
models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural
assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting
data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical
issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable
directions for future research.

Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential
to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep
learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify
images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures
is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some
picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being
utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The
suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how
picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study
specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more
complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when
image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may
learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are
incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend
the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification
accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct
extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms
customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the
trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

Conclusion: 自动化框架适合长期大规模数据收集，但半自动化方法可作为过渡方案。

Abstract: In this report a framework for the collection of clinical images and data for
use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is
described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the
images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes
to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and
agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups.
  A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that
it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the
data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in
the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets
have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical
outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old
data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the
imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation
dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and
active now.
  Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated
approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended
for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data
collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are
provided.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for
studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due
to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates
of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a
standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and
comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common
coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework
for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal
brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model
with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219
neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method
achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with
sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.
Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed
neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the
maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized
developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,
supporting both research and clinical applications. The model code is available

Conclusion: LA-CaRe-CNN的分割结果对生成患者特异性心脏数字孪生模型和个性化消融治疗具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac
arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation
therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to
prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,
however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred
tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic
resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading
Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium
as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage
CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a
prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction
with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial
scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during
training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the
diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold
ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm
ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more
challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through
LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation
therapy to treat AF.

Result: MDNs为D和f参数提供了更校准和更尖锐的预测分布，尽管D*参数存在轻微过度自信。

Conclusion: 该框架为IVIM拟合提供了全面的不确定性量化方法，并可推广到其他物理模型。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parameters from
diffusion-weighted MRI remains challenging due to the ill-posed nature of the
inverse problem and high sensitivity to noise, particularly in the perfusion
compartment. In this work, we propose a probabilistic deep learning framework
based on Deep Ensembles (DE) of Mixture Density Networks (MDNs), enabling
estimation of total predictive uncertainty and decomposition into aleatoric
(AU) and epistemic (EU) components. The method was benchmarked against non
probabilistic neural networks, a Bayesian fitting approach and a probabilistic
network with single Gaussian parametrization. Supervised training was performed
on synthetic data, and evaluation was conducted on both simulated and two in
vivo datasets. The reliability of the quantified uncertainties was assessed
using calibration curves, output distribution sharpness, and the Continuous
Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). MDNs produced more calibrated and sharper
predictive distributions for the D and f parameters, although slight
overconfidence was observed in D*. The Robust Coefficient of Variation (RCV)
indicated smoother in vivo estimates for D* with MDNs compared to Gaussian
model. Despite the training data covering the expected physiological range,
elevated EU in vivo suggests a mismatch with real acquisition conditions,
highlighting the importance of incorporating EU, which was allowed by DE.
Overall, we present a comprehensive framework for IVIM fitting with uncertainty
quantification, which enables the identification and interpretation of
unreliable estimates. The proposed approach can also be adopted for fitting
other physical models through appropriate architectural and simulation
adjustments.

model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify
classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of
ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to
evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of
class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the
Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to
detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to
rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised
scenarios.

Method: 提出FUTransUNet，将Vision Transformers的全局注意力机制集成到U-Net框架中，结合跳跃连接和解码路径，实现全局上下文特征提取和细粒度空间分辨率保持。

Result: 在FUSeg数据集上，训练集Dice系数为0.8679，IoU为0.7672；验证集Dice系数为0.8751，IoU为0.7780，验证损失为0.009045。Grad-CAM可视化验证了模型的透明性。

Conclusion: FUTransUNet成功整合了全局和局部特征提取，提供了高鲁棒性、准确性和可解释性的DFU分割解决方案，具有临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role
in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring.
However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance,
irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in
clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as
U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model
long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive
fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that
integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into
the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global
contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through
skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated
FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset.
FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672,
and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice
Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To
ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which
highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes
clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and
local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate,
explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution
for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable,
high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving
real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective
cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries)
to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient,
next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed
for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the
PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities
in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12
independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used
for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20
external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI,
IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in
Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external
testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in
agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made
by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two
expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and
peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate
cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is
prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard
of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening)
cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived
from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary
measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient
ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

TL;DR: UNISELF是一种深度学习方法，用于多发性硬化（MS）病灶的自动分割，通过测试时自集成病灶融合和测试时实例归一化，显著提高了单域训练的准确性和跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在单源有限数据训练下难以同时优化域内准确性和跨域泛化性，UNISELF旨在填补这一空白。

Method: UNISELF采用测试时自集成病灶融合提升分割准确性，并利用测试时实例归一化（TTIN）处理域偏移和缺失输入对比度。

Result: 在ISBI 2015测试数据集上表现优异，并在多个跨域测试数据集（如MICCAI 2016和UMCL）上超越基准方法。

Conclusion: UNISELF在单域训练和跨域泛化方面表现出色，为MS病灶分割提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast
magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared
to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving
state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to
simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization
when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has
been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF,
which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while
demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test
datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to
improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization
(TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts.
Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training
dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test
dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the
same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain
shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL
datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit
domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition
protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect
acquisition. Our code is available at https://github.com/uponacceptance.

TL;DR: PET2Rep是首个专注于PET图像报告生成的基准数据集，填补了现有基准的空白，并评估了30种前沿视觉语言模型（VLMs）的性能。结果表明，当前最先进的VLMs在PET报告生成任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像在临床决策中至关重要，但手动生成报告耗时且劳动密集。现有VLMs主要关注结构成像，忽略了PET分子成像的独特特性。

Method: 引入PET2Rep基准数据集，包含全身图像-报告对，并设计临床效率指标评估报告质量。比较30种前沿VLMs的性能。

Result: 当前最先进的VLMs在PET报告生成任务上表现不佳，无法满足实际需求。

Conclusion: 需解决多个关键不足，以推动VLMs在医学应用中的发展。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and
neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic
metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging
technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet
their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent
advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in
medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report
generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have
predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique
characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To
bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET
images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report
generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body
image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in
existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In
addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce
a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer
uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a
head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and
medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art
VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short
of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency
that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

Motivation: 解决弥漫性肺病研究中标注数据稀缺的问题，利用MAEs从无标签数据中学习有效特征。

Method: 训练MAE于5000多张胸部CT扫描（包括内部和公开数据），并在下游分类任务中微调。

Result: MAE能提取临床相关特征，显著提升诊断性能。

Conclusion: MAEs在无大规模标注数据情况下仍能有效提升诊断能力。

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative
feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung
disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage
this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed
tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans
from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as
COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a
downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our
findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful
features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale
labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here:

Motivation: 现有图像配准方法多针对单一器官，限制了其在其他解剖区域的通用性。

Method: 采用标准UNet架构和新型场分解策略，构建轻量化模型（训练仅需11GB GPU内存）。

Result: 在内部数据集上，多器官腹部配准性能优于基线方法，肺部配准略有下降；在外部数据集上表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: TotalRegistrator展示了在多器官图像配准中的高效性和强泛化能力，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal
and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing
methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their
generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents
TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple
anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a
novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only
11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we
constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body
(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at
different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic
classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image
registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated
our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal
datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal
dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house
dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in
multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment
performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results
compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those
tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability. The source code will be publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究状态归一化方法对强化学习在投资组合优化中性能的影响，尤其是在不同市场（如IBOVESPA、NYSE和加密货币）中的表现。

Method: 评估两种广泛使用的状态归一化方法，并在三个不同市场（IBOVESPA、NYSE和加密货币）中与标准数据归一化方法进行比较。

Result: 状态归一化确实会降低代理在投资组合优化中的性能。

Conclusion: 在特定领域中，状态归一化可能对强化学习代理的性能产生负面影响，需要进一步研究优化方法。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable results in various
domains, including robotics, games, natural language processing, and finance.
In the financial domain, this approach has been applied to tasks such as
portfolio optimization, where an agent continuously adjusts the allocation of
assets within a financial portfolio to maximize profit. Numerous studies have
introduced new simulation environments, neural network architectures, and
training algorithms for this purpose. Among these, a domain-specific policy
gradient algorithm has gained significant attention in the research community
for being lightweight, fast, and for outperforming other approaches. However,
recent studies have shown that this algorithm can yield inconsistent results
and underperform, especially when the portfolio does not consist of
cryptocurrencies. One possible explanation for this issue is that the commonly
used state normalization method may cause the agent to lose critical
information about the true value of the assets being traded. This paper
explores this hypothesis by evaluating two of the most widely used
normalization methods across three different markets (IBOVESPA, NYSE, and
cryptocurrencies) and comparing them with the standard practice of normalizing
data before training. The results indicate that, in this specific domain, the
state normalization can indeed degrade the agent's performance.

Motivation: 数据集标注成本高且耗时，现有弱监督方法无法评估标签概率的可靠性。

Method: 利用不确定性分布集封装弱标注函数的信息，提供置信区间。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，置信区间实用性强。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了弱监督的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: The accurate labeling of datasets is often both costly and time-consuming.
Given an unlabeled dataset, programmatic weak supervision obtains probabilistic
predictions for the labels by leveraging multiple weak labeling functions (LFs)
that provide rough guesses for labels. Weak LFs commonly provide guesses with
assorted types and unknown interdependences that can result in unreliable
predictions. Furthermore, existing techniques for programmatic weak supervision
cannot provide assessments for the reliability of the probabilistic predictions
for labels. This paper presents a methodology for programmatic weak supervision
that can provide confidence intervals for label probabilities and obtain more
reliable predictions. In particular, the methods proposed use uncertainty sets
of distributions that encapsulate the information provided by LFs with
unrestricted behavior and typology. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
show the improvement of the presented methods over the state-of-the-art and the
practicality of the confidence intervals presented.

Motivation: 解决传统强化学习算法在无限时间MDP中需要大量环境交互的问题，利用偏序关系实现高效性能估计。

Method: 利用策略类偏序关系，设计了一种基于epoch的算法，支持反事实推理，无需额外环境交互。

Result: 算法实现了$O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$的遗憾上界，且与状态和动作空间大小无关。

Conclusion: 该算法在库存控制和排队系统等领域具有广泛应用，无需额外假设即可获得理论和实证上的优越性能。

Abstract: We propose an epoch-based reinforcement learning algorithm for
infinite-horizon average-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs) that leverages a
partial order over a policy class. In this structure, $\pi' \leq \pi$ if data
collected under $\pi$ can be used to estimate the performance of $\pi'$,
enabling counterfactual inference without additional environment interaction.
Leveraging this partial order, we show that our algorithm achieves a regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{w \log(|\Theta|) T})$, where $w$ is the width of the partial
order. Notably, the bound is independent of the state and action space sizes.
We illustrate the applicability of these partial orders in many domains in
operations research, including inventory control and queuing systems. For each,
we apply our framework to that problem, yielding new theoretical guarantees and
strong empirical results without imposing extra assumptions such as convexity
in the inventory model or specialized arrival-rate structure in the queuing
model.

Abstract: Negative binomial regression is essential for analyzing over-dispersed count

computationally challenging in large screens requiring millions of comparisons.
We investigate using a pre-trained transformer to produce estimates of negative
binomial regression parameters from observed count data, trained through
synthetic data generation to learn to invert the process of generating counts
from parameters. The transformer method achieved better parameter accuracy than
maximum likelihood optimization while being 20 times faster. However,
comparisons unexpectedly revealed that method of moment estimates performed as
well as maximum likelihood optimization in accuracy, while being 1,000 times
faster and producing better-calibrated and more powerful tests, making it the
most efficient solution for this application.

Motivation: 传统自适应滤波框架依赖显式成本函数设计，难以泛化。本文旨在通过DNN直接获取梯度，提升泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes a deep neural network (DNN)-driven framework to address
the longstanding generalization challenge in adaptive filtering (AF). In
contrast to traditional AF frameworks that emphasize explicit cost function
design, the proposed framework shifts the paradigm toward direct gradient
acquisition. The DNN, functioning as a universal nonlinear operator, is
structurally embedded into the core architecture of the AF system, establishing
a direct mapping between filtering residuals and learning gradients. The
maximum likelihood is adopted as the implicit cost function, rendering the
derived algorithm inherently data-driven and thus endowed with exemplary
generalization capability, which is validated by extensive numerical
experiments across a spectrum of non-Gaussian scenarios. Corresponding mean
value and mean square stability analyses are also conducted in detail.

Result: 发现算法个体稳定但相对稳定性不成立，CV置信区间在比较性能差异时无效。

Conclusion: 在比较两种算法的性能差异时，即使算法本身稳定，仍需谨慎使用CV的置信区间。

Abstract: Existing work has shown that cross-validation (CV) can be used to provide an
asymptotic confidence interval for the test error of a stable machine learning
algorithm, and existing stability results for many popular algorithms can be
applied to derive positive instances where such confidence intervals will be
valid. However, in the common setting where CV is used to compare two
algorithms, it becomes necessary to consider a notion of relative stability
which cannot easily be derived from existing stability results, even for simple
algorithms. To better understand relative stability and when CV provides valid
confidence intervals for the test error difference of two algorithms, we study
the soft-thresholded least squares algorithm, a close cousin of the Lasso. We
prove that while stability holds when assessing the individual test error of
this algorithm, relative stability fails to hold when comparing the test error
of two such algorithms, even in a sparse low-dimensional linear model setting.
Additionally, we empirically confirm the invalidity of CV confidence intervals
for the test error difference when either soft-thresholding or the Lasso is
used. In short, caution is needed when quantifying the uncertainty of CV
estimates of the performance difference of two machine learning algorithms,
even when both algorithms are individually stable.

work has explored the ability of neural networks to quantify predictive,

classification, its applicability to real life medical diagnosis tasks remains
underexplored. In this study, we provide an extensive uncertainty
quantification benchmark for multi-label chest X-ray classification using the

Abstract: Metric learning from a set of triplet comparisons in the form of "Do you
think item h is more similar to item i or item j?", indicating similarity and
differences between items, plays a key role in various applications including
image retrieval, recommendation systems, and cognitive psychology. The goal is
to learn a metric in the RKHS that reflects the comparisons. Nonlinear metric
learning using kernel methods and neural networks have shown great empirical
promise. While previous works have addressed certain aspects of this problem,
there is little or no theoretical understanding of such methods. The exception
is the special (linear) case in which the RKHS is the standard Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^d$; there is a comprehensive theory for metric learning in
$\mathbb{R}^d$. This paper develops a general RKHS framework for metric
learning and provides novel generalization guarantees and sample complexity
bounds. We validate our findings through a set of simulations and experiments
on real datasets. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme
weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically
viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus
primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there
remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can
effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment
through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization
approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically
adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel
framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with
market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08
over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO
scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching
configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and
grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact
within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic
calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive
reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives
with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85%
of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs),
incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and
customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a
benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives
for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives

Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of the State Of Charge (SOC) of
lithium-ion cells via the combination of two widely used paradigms: Kalman
Filters (KFs) equipped with Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) and
machine-learning approaches. In particular, a recent Virtual Sensor (VS)
synthesis technique is considered, which operates as follows: (i) learn an
Affine Parameter-Varying (APV) model of the cell directly from data, (ii)
derive a bank of linear observers from the APV model, (iii) train a
machine-learning technique from features extracted from the observers together
with input and output data to predict the SOC. The SOC predictions returned by
the VS are supplied to an Extended KF (EKF) as output measurements along with
the cell terminal voltage, combining the two paradigms. A data-driven
calibration strategy for the noise covariance matrices of the EKF is proposed.
Experimental results show that the designed approach is beneficial w.r.t. SOC
estimation accuracy and smoothness.

Motivation: 探索自编码器在多相流降维建模中的准确性和适用性，为后续低维潜在空间中的时序或输入/输出模型训练提供基础。

Method: 使用合成数据和高分辨率模拟数据训练和验证卷积架构的自编码器，分析不同界面表示方法的效果。

Result: 明确了多相流降维的最佳实践，为后续模型训练提供了低维潜在空间。

Conclusion: 本研究为多相流领域提供了重要的自编码器应用指导，具有广泛的实际意义。

Abstract: In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation of autoencoders for
reduced-order modeling of three-dimensional multiphase flows. Focusing on the
accuracy of reconstructing multiphase flow volume/mass fractions with a
standard convolutional architecture, we examine the advantages and
disadvantages of different interface representation choices (diffuse, sharp,
level set). We use a combination of synthetic data with non-trivial interface
topologies and high-resolution simulation data of multiphase homogeneous
isotropic turbulence for training and validation. This study clarifies the best
practices for reducing the dimensionality of multiphase flows via autoencoders.
Consequently, this paves the path for uncoupling the training of autoencoders
for accurate reconstruction and the training of temporal or input/output models
such as neural operators (e.g., FNOs, DeepONets) and neural ODEs on the
lower-dimensional latent space given by the autoencoders. As such, the
implications of this study are significant and of interest to the multiphase
flow community and beyond.

TL;DR: PCA在结构化应用下可实现神经模型的极端压缩且不牺牲性能，适用于多种模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过PCA压缩输入数据，以降低模型复杂度同时保持性能。

Method: 将PCA应用于极坐标变换图像或分段标记序列，并在三个案例中验证其效果。

Result: PCA压缩后的模型在MNIST、20 Newsgroups和MiniLM上表现优异，参数大幅减少。

Conclusion: PCA输入压缩是一种通用且有效的策略，适用于轻量级架构设计。

Abstract: We demonstrate that Principal Component Analysis (PCA), when applied in a
structured manner, either to polar-transformed images or segment-wise to token
sequences, enables extreme compression of neural models without sacrificing
performance. Across three case studies, we show that a one-layer classifier
trained on PCA-compressed polar MNIST achieves over 98 percent accuracy using
only 840 parameters. A two-layer transformer trained on 70-dimensional
PCA-reduced MiniLM embeddings reaches 76.62 percent accuracy on the 20
Newsgroups dataset with just 81000 parameters. A decoder-only transformer
generates coherent token sequences from 70-dimensional PCA embeddings while
preserving over 97 percent cosine similarity with full MiniLM representations,
using less than 17 percent of the parameter count of GPT-2. These results
highlight PCA-based input compression as a general and effective strategy for
aligning model capacity with information content, enabling lightweight
architectures across multiple modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献数量激增，科学家需要从大量论文中提取有用信息，但手动阅读标题和摘要耗时且低效。

Method: 在BIP! Finder中引入两种摘要功能：简洁摘要和详细文献综述式摘要，基于已有的影响力排名和过滤功能动态生成。

Result: 该功能能显著加速文献发现和理解，提供上下文敏感的合成叙述。

Conclusion: 通过动态摘要功能，BIP! Finder优化了研究流程，提升了文献理解的效率。

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for
scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a
topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a
scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious
task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make
sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck
in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder,
a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact
aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate
two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an
instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature
review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability
dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and
filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that
can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

Motivation: 传统手动构建的研究主题本体耗时且易过时，Sci-OG旨在通过半自动化方法解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多步骤方法：主题发现、关系分类（核心部分，结合语言模型和文献特征）和本体构建。

Result: 在21,649个手动标注的语义三元组数据集上，F1分数达0.951，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: Sci-OG能有效提升科学知识的可访问性和组织性，支持AI驱动的文献管理和研究探索。

Abstract: Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM)
play a central role in providing the primary framework through which
intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these
resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is
time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper
presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic
ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting
potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification,
determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology
Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The
relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the
system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing
topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach
against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually
annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951),
surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model
and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is
corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our
system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented
solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis
of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled
literature management and research exploration.

Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells
that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired
neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into
various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic
self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored
in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic
plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of
non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the
neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the
impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning
application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks
(IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic
Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the
model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the
WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional
models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse
machine learning tasks.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的时空约束损失函数（STC），用于构建地形深度脉冲神经网络（TDSNN），成功模拟了灵长类视觉皮层的功能组织，并在性能和生物相似性上优于传统人工神经网络（ANNs）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度人工神经网络（ANNs）在模拟视觉皮层的功能组织时忽略了时间动态，导致性能下降和生物相似性不足。为了解决这一问题，作者利用脉冲神经网络（SNNs）的时空特性，提出了一种新的方法。

Method: 作者提出了一种时空约束损失函数（STC），用于训练地形深度脉冲神经网络（TDSNNs），以模拟视觉皮层的层次化功能组织。

Result: 实验结果表明，TDSNNs在保持高性能（如ImageNet top-1准确率无下降）的同时，显著提升了生物相似性，并优于现有的地形人工神经网络（如TopoNet）。此外，地形组织通过脉冲机制促进了高效稳定的时间信息处理。

Conclusion: TDSNNs在计算性能和生物相似性之间取得了平衡，为神经科学现象的解释和高效深度学习模型的设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

Motivation: 3DGS中的超参数调优通常依赖专家经验且耗时，导致结果不一致或次优。RLGS旨在通过自动化调优解决这一问题。

Method: RLGS通过轻量级策略模块动态调整关键超参数（如学习率和密度阈值），适用于多种3DGS变体且无需架构修改。

Result: RLGS显著提升了渲染质量，例如在TNT数据集上将Taming-3DGS的PSNR提高了0.7dB，且在基线性能饱和时仍能带来增益。

Conclusion: RLGS为3DGS训练中的超参数调优提供了一种高效通用的自动化解决方案，填补了强化学习在3DGS中的应用空白。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive
and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and
suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning
framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy
modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates
and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly
integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We
demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS
variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness
across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For
example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT)
dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when
baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an
effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS
training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Result: 在ScanNet++和Replica数据集上达到最先进性能，重建速度快且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Surf3R在无需相机标定的情况下实现了高效、高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera
calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive
pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this
challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that
reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and
completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a
multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference
views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed
branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the
model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring
camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an
explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples
surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D
geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica
datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive
believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining
traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning
models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive
character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.
For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes
use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real
time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the
character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally
stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a
commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,
intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters
via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be
implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system
for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.

TL;DR: ARL方法通过聚类和子集分析解决Lasso在高相关性特征下的不稳定问题，区分真假相关性，优化特征选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lasso在高相关性特征下表现不稳定，导致特征选择错误，现有方法仅解决部分问题。

Method: ARL通过聚类识别数据子集结构，分析Lasso行为，区分真假相关性，选择代表性特征。

Result: ARL能有效区分真假相关性，最大化信息变量，减少有害变量。

Conclusion: ARL通过精细分析提升Lasso在高相关性数据中的表现，实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: The Lasso method is known to exhibit instability in the presence of highly
correlated features, often leading to an arbitrary selection of predictors.
This issue manifests itself in two primary error types: the erroneous omission
of features that lack a true substitutable relationship (falsely redundant
features) and the inclusion of features with a true substitutable relationship
(truly redundant features). Although most existing methods address only one of
these challenges, we introduce the Accept-Reject Lasso (ARL), a novel approach
that resolves this dilemma. ARL operationalizes an Accept-Reject framework
through a fine-grained analysis of feature selection across data subsets. This
framework is designed to partition the output of an ensemble method into
beneficial and detrimental components through fine-grained analysis. The
fundamental challenge for Lasso is that inter-variable correlation obscures the
true sources of information. ARL tackles this by first using clustering to
identify distinct subset structures within the data. It then analyzes Lasso's
behavior across these subsets to differentiate between true and spurious
correlations. For truly correlated features, which induce multicollinearity,
ARL tends to select a single representative feature and reject the rest to
ensure model stability. Conversely, for features linked by spurious
correlations, which may vanish in certain subsets, ARL accepts those that Lasso
might have incorrectly omitted. The distinct patterns arising from true versus
spurious correlations create a divisible separation. By setting an appropriate
threshold, our framework can effectively distinguish between these two
phenomena, thereby maximizing the inclusion of informative variables while
minimizing the introduction of detrimental ones. We illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed method through extensive simulation and real-data experiments.

Conclusion: 通过调整参数和神经元数量，可以提取准确的场论结果，改进后的架构更具潜力。

Abstract: Neural Network (NN) architectures that break statistical independence of
parameters have been proposed as a new approach for simulating local quantum
field theories (QFTs). In the infinite neuron number limit, single-layer NNs
can exactly reproduce QFT results. This paper examines the viability of this
architecture for perturbative calculations of local QFTs for finite neuron
number $N$ using scalar $\phi^4$ theory in $d$ Euclidean dimensions as an
example. We find that the renormalized $O(1/N)$ corrections to two- and
four-point correlators yield perturbative series which are sensitive to the
ultraviolet cut-off and therefore have a weak convergence. We propose a
modification to the architecture to improve this convergence and discuss
constraints on the parameters of the theory and the scaling of N which allow us
to extract accurate field theory results.

Motivation: 分布式训练和部署大型语言模型（LLMs）时，通信瓶颈成为关键挑战，需要高效的跨GPU传输方案。

Method: 提出位拆分技术将不规则比特宽度分解为基本单元，确保硬件兼容性；尖峰保留技术保留数值异常值（最小值和最大值）为浮点数，缩小动态数值范围并支持2比特量化。

Result: 在NVLink和PCIe架构上实现稳健性能，AllReduce通信速度提升最高3.2倍，All2All通信速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: FlashCommunication V2 通过软硬件协同设计，显著优化了通信效率，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: Nowadays, communication bottlenecks have emerged as a critical challenge in
the distributed training and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This
paper introduces FlashCommunication V2, a novel communication paradigm enabling
efficient cross-GPU transmission at arbitrary bit widths. Its core innovations
lie in the proposed bit splitting and spike reserving techniques, which address
the challenges of low-bit quantization. Bit splitting decomposes irregular bit
widths into basic units, ensuring compatibility with hardware capabilities and
thus enabling transmission at any bit width. Spike reserving, on the other
hand, retains numerical outliers (i.e., minima and maxima) as floating-point
numbers, which shrinks the dynamic numerical range and pushes the quantization
limits to 2-bit with acceptable losses. FlashCommunication V2 significantly
enhances the flexibility and resource utilization of communication systems.
Through meticulous software-hardware co-design, it delivers robust performance
and reduced overhead across both NVLink-based and PCIe-based architectures,
achieving a maximum 3.2$\times$ speedup in AllReduce and 2$\times$ in All2All

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的二维稀疏并行方法，用于解决深度学习推荐模型（DLRM）中嵌入表的大规模并行训练问题，显著提升了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DLRM模型的复杂性增加，传统全并行策略在扩展性上面临挑战，如负载不均、通信开销大和内存占用高。

Method: 提出二维稀疏并行方法，结合数据并行和模型并行，并开发动量缩放的行级AdaGrad算法以减少性能损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在4K GPU上实现了近乎线性的训练速度扩展，同时保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为推荐模型训练设定了新的性能基准，解决了传统并行策略的扩展性问题。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) has
led to a growing need for large-scale distributed systems that can efficiently
train vast amounts of data. In DLRM, the sparse embedding table is a crucial
component for managing sparse categorical features. Typically, these tables in
industrial DLRMs contain trillions of parameters, necessitating model
parallelism strategies to address memory constraints. However, as training
systems expand with massive GPUs, the traditional fully parallelism strategies
for embedding table post significant scalability challenges, including
imbalance and straggler issues, intensive lookup communication, and heavy
embedding activation memory. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
two-dimensional sparse parallelism approach. Rather than fully sharding tables
across all GPUs, our solution introduces data parallelism on top of model
parallelism. This enables efficient all-to-all communication and reduces peak
memory consumption. Additionally, we have developed the momentum-scaled
row-wise AdaGrad algorithm to mitigate performance losses associated with the
shift in training paradigms. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly enhances training efficiency while maintaining
model performance parity. It achieves nearly linear training speed scaling up
to 4K GPUs, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark for recommendation model
training.

*Borui Li,Li Yan,Jianmin Liu*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: SelectiveShield是一种轻量级混合防御框架，结合选择性同态加密和差分隐私，通过Fisher信息量化参数敏感性，保护联邦学习中的敏感数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分散数据上协作训练模型，但易受梯度泄漏攻击，现有防御机制（如差分隐私和同态加密）在隐私、模型效用和系统开销之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出SelectiveShield框架，利用Fisher信息量化参数敏感性，通过协作协商协议确定需保护的敏感参数，结合同态加密和差分隐私。

Result: 实验表明，SelectiveShield在保持模型效用的同时显著降低梯度泄漏风险。

Conclusion: SelectiveShield为实际联邦学习部署提供了实用且可扩展的防御机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training on decentralized
data but remains vulnerable to gradient leakage attacks that can reconstruct
sensitive user information. Existing defense mechanisms, such as differential
privacy (DP) and homomorphic encryption (HE), often introduce a trade-off
between privacy, model utility, and system overhead, a challenge that is
exacerbated in heterogeneous environments with non-IID data and varying client
capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose SelectiveShield, a
lightweight hybrid defense framework that adaptively integrates selective
homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. SelectiveShield leverages
Fisher information to quantify parameter sensitivity, allowing clients to
identify critical parameters locally. Through a collaborative negotiation
protocol, clients agree on a shared set of the most sensitive parameters for
protection via homomorphic encryption. Parameters that are uniquely important
to individual clients are retained locally, fostering personalization, while
non-critical parameters are protected with adaptive differential privacy noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelectiveShield maintains strong model
utility while significantly mitigating gradient leakage risks, offering a
practical and scalable defense mechanism for real-world federated learning
deployments.

### [399] [What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03824)
*Hamzah I. Khan,Jingqi Li,David Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决多智能体战略交互中目标推断问题的框架，通过引入二级推断（level-2 inference）来捕捉智能体对彼此目标的异质估计，解决了传统一级推断（level-1 inference）在现实场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一级推断方法假设智能体完全了解彼此的目标，但在现实场景（如城市驾驶和谈判）中，智能体可能基于对彼此目标的不同理解行动，导致推断误差。

Method: 提出了一种二级推断框架，通过梯度优化方法在非凸问题中寻找局部解。

Result: 在合成城市驾驶实验中，该方法成功揭示了传统一级推断方法忽略的细微目标不一致。

Conclusion: 二级推断框架为解决多智能体交互中的目标推断问题提供了更有效的方法，尤其在现实场景中表现出优越性。

Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents
requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing
inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1"
inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer
and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's
objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world
decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act
based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the
necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's
objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the
prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from
linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a
framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent
believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference
problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and
we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local
solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our
approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.

Result: 新机制在预测准确时表现良好，同时在预测不准确时仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过考虑多因素和参数调整，实现了设施选址机制的优化，并成功扩展到双设施问题。

Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with
predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an
egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent
from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new
insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As
in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst
case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of
the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions
can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by
adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency.
We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof
mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness
that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.

Conclusion: 该方法有效克服视场与分辨率矛盾，可直接应用于实际望远镜系统。

Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV)
and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is
under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational
imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive
optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use
the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely
controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images
that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then
be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we
show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO
operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront
distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate
end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the
upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal
statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our
experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,
demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO
super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no
hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a
complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily
transferred to an operational telescope. Project webpage:

Motivation: 早产儿皮质神经发育异常可能导致认知和行为问题，但早期预测困难。个体化模拟可识别细微偏差作为风险标志。

Method: 使用图扩散网络模拟皮质成熟，基于dHCP的皮质表面数据，保持个体特异性形态。

Result: 模型能欺骗独立训练的年龄回归网络，预测准确率为0.85±0.62。

Conclusion: 该方法为早产儿神经发育风险预测提供了新工具，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Preterm birth disrupts the typical trajectory of cortical neurodevelopment,
increasing the risk of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. However, outcomes
vary widely, posing a significant challenge for early prediction. To address
this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling
subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification
of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of
risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating
neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific
cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological
variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that
supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface
data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that
the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling
cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age
regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态可穿戴传感器的非侵入式机器学习框架，用于检测脊髓损伤患者的自主神经反射异常（AD），显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AD检测方法多为侵入性或依赖主观症状报告，限制了日常应用，因此需要一种非侵入、准确的监测方法。

Method: 使用多模态传感器数据（ECG、PPG、BioZ等），通过BorutaSHAP进行特征选择，训练弱学习器并堆叠集成。

Result: HR和ECG特征最具信息量，集成模型性能最佳（Macro F1=0.77），HR模态AUC最高（0.93）。

Conclusion: 该框架为脊髓损伤患者的个性化实时监测提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening condition
characterized by sudden, severe blood pressure (BP) spikes in individuals with
spinal cord injury (SCI). Early, accurate detection is essential to prevent
cardiovascular complications, yet current monitoring methods are either
invasive or rely on subjective symptom reporting, limiting applicability in
daily file. This study presents a non-invasive, explainable machine learning
framework for detecting AD using multimodal wearable sensors. Data were
collected from 27 individuals with chronic SCI during urodynamic studies,
including electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), bioimpedance
(BioZ), temperature, respiratory rate (RR), and heart rate (HR), across three
commercial devices. Objective AD labels were derived from synchronized
cuff-based BP measurements. Following signal preprocessing and feature
extraction, BorutaSHAP was used for robust feature selection, and SHAP values
for explainability. We trained modality- and device-specific weak learners and
aggregated them using a stacked ensemble meta-model. Cross-validation was
stratified by participants to ensure generalizability. HR- and ECG-derived
features were identified as the most informative, particularly those capturing
rhythm morphology and variability. The Nearest Centroid ensemble yielded the
highest performance (Macro F1 = 0.77+/-0.03), significantly outperforming
baseline models. Among modalities, HR achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC = 0.93), followed by ECG (0.88) and PPG (0.86). RR and temperature
features contributed less to overall accuracy, consistent with missing data and
low specificity. The model proved robust to sensor dropout and aligned well
with clinical AD events. These results represent an important step toward
personalized, real-time monitoring for individuals with SCI.

Additionally, we gathered subjective self-reports of participants' fatigue,
stress, and sleep quality through surveys conducted immediately before and
after sleep. This comprehensive lifelog dataset is expected to provide a
foundational resource for exploring meaningful insights into human daily life
and lifestyle patterns, and a portion of the data has been anonymized and made
publicly available for further research. In this paper, we introduce the ETRI
Lifelog Dataset 2024, detailing its structure and presenting potential
applications, such as using machine learning models to predict sleep quality
and stress.

Result: 在英语和中文数据集上的实验表明，该模型显著优于现有零样本TTS模型的合成质量和效率。

Conclusion: 提出的并行GPT架构通过协调声学和语义信息的独立性和依赖性，有效提升了零样本TTS性能。

Abstract: Advances in speech representation and large language models have enhanced
zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) performance. However, existing zero-shot TTS
models face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic
and semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity.
The primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and
acoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent aspects.This
paper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and
non-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and
interdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages
the proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic
tokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the
Coupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's
output. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve
zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments
on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
significantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of
existing zero-shot TTS models. Speech demos are available at

Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create
natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these
tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making
it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current
research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has
been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper
introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing,
covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate
DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on
different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and
evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer
the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech
generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset,

Result: 提出了一个更广泛且稳健的框架，克服了以往研究的局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为情感识别任务提供了更可靠的可解释特征识别方法，弥补了无监督方法的不足。

Abstract: Unsupervised methods, such as wav2vec2 and HuBERT, have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in audio tasks, leading to a shift away from
research on interpretable features. However, the lack of interpretability in
these methods limits their applicability in critical domains like medicine,
where understanding feature relevance is crucial. To better understand the
features of unsupervised models, it remains critical to identify the
interpretable features relevant to a given task. In this work, we focus on
emotion recognition and use machine learning algorithms to identify and
generalize the most important interpretable features for this task. While
previous studies have explored feature relevance in emotion recognition, they
are often constrained by narrow contexts and present inconsistent findings. Our
approach aims to overcome these limitations, providing a broader and more
robust framework for identifying the most important interpretable features.

Conclusion: BiSELDnet通过BTFF特征和VAM可视化，成功解决了声音事件定位和检测的挑战，为机器人情境感知提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid robots require simultaneous sound event type and direction
estimation for situational awareness, but conventional two-channel input
struggles with elevation estimation and front-back confusion. This paper
proposes a binaural sound event localization and detection (BiSELD) neural
network to address these challenges. BiSELDnet learns time-frequency patterns
and head-related transfer function (HRTF) localization cues from binaural input
features. A novel eight-channel binaural time-frequency feature (BTFF) is
introduced, comprising left/right mel-spectrograms, V-maps, an interaural time
difference (ITD) map (below 1.5 kHz), an interaural level difference (ILD) map
(above 5 kHz with front-back asymmetry), and spectral cue (SC) maps (above 5
kHz for elevation). The effectiveness of BTFF was confirmed across
omnidirectional, horizontal, and median planes. BiSELDnets, particularly one
based on the efficient Trinity module, were implemented to output time series
of direction vectors for each sound event class, enabling simultaneous
detection and localization. Vector activation map (VAM) visualization was
proposed to analyze network learning, confirming BiSELDnet's focus on the N1
notch frequency for elevation estimation. Comparative evaluations under urban
background noise conditions demonstrated that the proposed BiSELD model
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SELD models with binaural
input.

Method: 提出说话人-文本分解网络，将输入语音分解为说话人嵌入和文本嵌入，并通过少量独立说话人适应语音提取目标文本嵌入，生成文本定制说话人嵌入。

Result: 在RSR2015数据集上，文本适应显著改善了文本不匹配条件下的性能。

Conclusion: 文本适应框架有效解决了文本不匹配问题，提升了说话人验证系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Text mismatch between pre-collected data, either training data or enrollment
data, and the actual test data can significantly hurt text-dependent speaker
verification (SV) system performance. Although this problem can be solved by
carefully collecting data with the target speech content, such data collection
could be costly and inflexible. In this paper, we propose a novel text
adaptation framework to address the text mismatch issue. Here, a speaker-text
factorization network is proposed to factorize the input speech into speaker
embeddings and text embeddings and then integrate them into a single
representation in the later stage. Given a small amount of speaker-independent
adaptation utterances, text embeddings of target speech content can be
extracted and used to adapt the text-independent speaker embeddings to
text-customized speaker embeddings. Experiments on RSR2015 show that text
adaptation can significantly improve the performance of text mismatch
conditions.

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is growing in the productive
completion of Software Engineering tasks. Yet, studies investigating the
productive prompting techniques often employed a limited problem space,
primarily focusing on well-known prompting patterns and mainly targeting
function-level SE practices. We identify significant gaps in real-world
workflows that involve complexities beyond class-level (e.g., multi-class
dependencies) and different features that can impact Human-LLM Interactions
(HLIs) processes in code generation. To address these issues, we designed an
experiment that comprehensively analyzed the HLI features regarding the code
generation productivity. Our study presents two project-level benchmark tasks,
extending beyond function-level evaluations. We conducted a user study with 36
participants from diverse backgrounds, asking them to solve the assigned tasks
by interacting with the GPT assistant using specific prompting patterns. We
also examined the participants' experience and their behavioral features during
interactions by analyzing screen recordings and GPT chat logs. Our statistical
and empirical investigation revealed (1) that three out of 15 HLI features
significantly impacted the productivity in code generation; (2) five primary
guidelines for enhancing productivity for HLI processes; and (3) a taxonomy of
29 runtime and logic errors that can occur during HLI processes, along with
suggested mitigation plans.

*Hidenori Takeshima*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分组等色体的新MR模拟方法，显著减少了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统MR模拟器中需要单独模拟每个等色体的假设，以提高计算效率。

Method: 通过将多个等色体分组，共享模拟过程中的部分计算，特别是在特定梯度类型下选择行为相同的等色体组。

Result: 新方法比传统方法快3到72倍，例如在2700万个等色体下，FSE和EPI序列的模拟时间分别从208.4秒和66.4秒降至38.1秒和7.1秒。

Conclusion: 分组等色体方法显著提升了MR模拟的效率，适用于大规模模拟任务。

Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators:
Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the
computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped
isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before
simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a
certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for
ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as
the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field
inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be
combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis
only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed
methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE)
and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed
method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the
cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD)
instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI
sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the
proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前网络安全以设备为中心，忽视了AI对人类认知的攻击潜力。

Method: 提出TFVA协议，基于AIJET五项原则，并通过随机对照试验（n=151）验证其效果。

Result: 3分钟干预显著提升认知安全任务表现（+7.87%）。

Conclusion: TFVA协议可快速增强人类对AI操纵的抵抗力，建议将其嵌入GenAI平台，作为标准提示。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence enables unprecedented attacks on human cognition, yet
cybersecurity remains predominantly device-centric. This paper introduces the
"Think First, Verify Always" (TFVA) protocol, which repositions humans as
'Firewall Zero', the first line of defense against AI-enabled threats. The
protocol is grounded in five operational principles: Awareness, Integrity,
Judgment, Ethical Responsibility, and Transparency (AIJET). A randomized
controlled trial (n=151) demonstrated that a minimal 3-minute intervention
produced statistically significant improvements in cognitive security task
performance, with participants showing an absolute +7.87% gains compared to
controls. These results suggest that brief, principles-based training can
rapidly enhance human resilience against AI-driven cognitive manipulation. We
recommend that GenAI platforms embed "Think First, Verify Always" as a standard
prompt, replacing passive warnings with actionable protocols to enhance
trustworthy and ethical AI use. By bridging the gap between technical
cybersecurity and human factors, the TFVA protocol establishes human-empowered
security as a vital component of trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: StepWrite是一个基于大型语言模型的语音交互系统，支持用户在移动中无需手眼参与，通过结构化音频提示完成长篇文本的撰写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音转文本系统在撰写复杂、长篇文本时表现不佳，尤其是在用户无法视觉跟踪进度的情况下。

Method: StepWrite将写作过程分解为子任务，通过上下文感知的非视觉音频提示逐步引导用户，同时利用模型减轻用户的认知负担。

Result: 实证评估显示，StepWrite显著降低了认知负担，提升了可用性和用户满意度，技术评估也验证了其在动态上下文提示生成、语气对齐和事实核查方面的能力。

Conclusion: StepWrite展示了结构化、上下文感知的语音交互在增强免手免眼沟通方面的潜力。

Abstract: People frequently use speech-to-text systems to compose short texts with
voice. However, current voice-based interfaces struggle to support composing
more detailed, contextually complex texts, especially in scenarios where users
are on the move and cannot visually track progress. Longer-form communication,
such as composing structured emails or thoughtful responses, requires
persistent context tracking, structured guidance, and adaptability to evolving
user intentions--capabilities that conventional dictation tools and voice
assistants do not support. We introduce StepWrite, a large language
model-driven voice-based interaction system that augments human writing ability
by enabling structured, hands-free and eyes-free composition of longer-form
texts while on the move. StepWrite decomposes the writing process into
manageable subtasks and sequentially guides users with contextually-aware
non-visual audio prompts. StepWrite reduces cognitive load by offloading the
context-tracking and adaptive planning tasks to the models. Unlike baseline
methods like standard dictation features (e.g., Microsoft Word) and
conversational voice assistants (e.g., ChatGPT Advanced Voice Mode), StepWrite
dynamically adapts its prompts based on the evolving context and user intent,
and provides coherent guidance without compromising user autonomy. An empirical
evaluation with 25 participants engaging in mobile or stationary hands-occupied
activities demonstrated that StepWrite significantly reduces cognitive load,
improves usability and user satisfaction compared to baseline methods.
Technical evaluations further confirmed StepWrite's capability in dynamic
contextual prompt generation, accurate tone alignment, and effective fact
checking. This work highlights the potential of structured, context-aware voice
interactions in enhancing hands-free and eye-free communication in everyday
multitasking scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究提出Lit2Sal和Sal2Lit模型，利用视觉素养差异改进可视化设计和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视视觉素养对视觉注意力的影响，需个性化设计以提高可视化效果。

Method: 基于235名参与者的三项测试数据，分析注意力模式与视觉素养的关系，提出Lit2Sal和Sal2Lit模型。

Result: Lit2Sal优于现有显著性模型，Sal2Lit预测视觉素养准确率达86%。

Conclusion: 考虑个体差异的显著性模型为个性化可视化数据沟通提供新方向。

Abstract: Accounting for individual differences can improve the effectiveness of
visualization design. While the role of visual attention in visualization
interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this
behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a
235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT,
CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data
exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts
(high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers)
focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models
leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that
predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and
Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data.
Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal
outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware
considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single
attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment
that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to
consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in
literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual
data communication to enhance understanding.

Conclusion: DRIVE-T为数据可视化素养的测量提供了一种可操作的方法，支持难度层次的明确化和测试设计的优化。

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement
constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may
hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To
mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and
Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed
to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data
vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items
discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data
visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based
items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by
independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores
through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the
emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the
discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data
vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we
show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the
difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct
for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from
semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that
each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T
methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design
phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based
measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the
application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

fundamental operation that captures the computational patterns of many data
science applications, including but not limited to graph algorithms, sparsely
connected neural networks, graph neural networks, clustering, and many-to-many

  In many application scenarios, the matrix multiplication takes places on an
arbitrary algebraic semiring where the scalar operations are overloaded with
user-defined functions with certain properties or a more general heterogenous
algebra where even the domains of the input matrices can be different. Here, we
provide a unifying treatment of the sparse matrix-matrix operation and its rich
application space including machine learning, computational biology and

<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态推荐系统（MRS）在实际应用中常因模态缺失（如图像、描述不完整）导致性能下降，亟需一种能处理缺失模态的鲁棒方法。

Method: I³-MRec结合了不变风险最小化（IRM）和信息瓶颈（IB）原则，确保跨模态偏好一致性和紧凑有效的模态表示。

Conclusion: I³-MRec通过不变学习和信息瓶颈有效解决了模态缺失问题，为实际应用提供了鲁棒且高效的推荐解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems (MRS) improve recommendation performance by
integrating diverse semantic information from multiple modalities. However, the
assumption of the availability of all modalities rarely holds in practice due
to missing images, incomplete descriptions, or inconsistent user content. These
challenges significantly degrade the robustness and generalization capabilities
of current models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel method
called \textbf{I$^3$-MRec}, which uses \textbf{I}nvariant learning with
\textbf{I}nformation bottleneck principle for \textbf{I}ncomplete
\textbf{M}odality \textbf{Rec}ommendation. To achieve robust performance in
missing modality scenarios, I$^3$-MRec enforces two pivotal properties: (i)
cross-modal preference invariance, which ensures consistent user preference
modeling across varying modality environments, and (ii) compact yet effective
modality representation, which filters out task-irrelevant modality information
while maximally preserving essential features relevant to recommendation. By
treating each modality as a distinct semantic environment, I$^3$-MRec employs
invariant risk minimization (IRM) to learn modality-specific item
representations. In parallel, a missing-aware fusion module grounded in the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle extracts compact and effective item
embeddings by suppressing modality noise and preserving core user preference
signals. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets
demonstrate that I$^3$-MRec consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art
MRS methods across various modality-missing scenarios, highlighting its
effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. The code and processed
datasets are released at https://github.com/HuilinChenJN/I3-MRec.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种重要性感知的多粒度融合模型（IMG），用于视频时刻检索（VMR），通过动态选择性地聚合音频-视觉-文本模态，解决了现有方法忽视音频模态或简单嵌入的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VMR方法多关注视觉和文本模态，忽视了音频模态的互补作用，且少数尝试联合模态的方法未能精细处理音频的重要性。

Method: 设计了一个伪标签监督的音频重要性预测器，动态分配权重以减少噪声干扰，并提出多粒度音频融合模块和跨模态知识蒸馏策略。

Result: 在新建的数据集Charades-AudioMatter上验证了方法的有效性，实现了音频-视频融合的最优性能。

Conclusion: IMG模型通过动态选择和融合多模态信息，显著提升了VMR任务的性能。

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically
related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

Motivation: 生成模型在多个领域（如图像生成、文本合成）的应用日益广泛，但在推荐系统中的潜力尚未被充分挖掘。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种分类法，将深度生成模型（DGMs）分为ID驱动模型、大语言模型（LLMs）和多模态模型三类。

Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances
of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In
recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to
the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs),
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as
GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image
generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems,
generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and
diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based
interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities,
Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user
experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive
understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus
on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a
taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large
language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique
technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area.
This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys
across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation.
Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models,
emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.

Result: 实验显示，方法能恢复65%用户交互项目，87%情况下正确推断年龄和性别，隐私泄露与模型性能无关但与领域一致性和提示复杂度相关。

Conclusion: LLM推荐系统存在严重隐私漏洞，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: The large language model (LLM) powered recommendation paradigm has been
proposed to address the limitations of traditional recommender systems, which
often struggle to handle cold start users or items with new IDs. Despite its
effectiveness, this study uncovers that LLM empowered recommender systems are
vulnerable to reconstruction attacks that can expose both system and user
privacy. To examine this threat, we present the first systematic study on
inversion attacks targeting LLM empowered recommender systems, where
adversaries attempt to reconstruct original prompts that contain personal
preferences, interaction histories, and demographic attributes by exploiting
the output logits of recommendation models. We reproduce the vec2text framework
and optimize it using our proposed method called Similarity Guided Refinement,
enabling more accurate reconstruction of textual prompts from model generated
logits. Extensive experiments across two domains (movies and books) and two
representative LLM based recommendation models demonstrate that our method
achieves high fidelity reconstructions. Specifically, we can recover nearly 65
percent of the user interacted items and correctly infer age and gender in 87
percent of the cases. The experiments also reveal that privacy leakage is
largely insensitive to the victim model's performance but highly dependent on
domain consistency and prompt complexity. These findings expose critical
privacy vulnerabilities in LLM empowered recommender systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台如Twitter和Facebook已成为日常生活的一部分，为识别房地产相关问题提供了宝贵资源。

Method: 采用分层分类框架筛选相关帖子，并使用基于Transformer的地理定位模块推断无明确地理标签的帖子位置。

Result: 系统能够及时提供数据驱动的见解，支持城市管理、运营响应和情境感知。

Conclusion: 该集成方法为房地产相关事件的检测和分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply
embedded in our everyday life, offering a dynamic stream of localized news and
personal experiences. The ubiquity of these platforms position them as valuable
resources for identifying estate-related issues, especially in the context of
growing urban populations. In this work, we present a language model-based
system for the detection and classification of estate-related events from
social media content. Our system employs a hierarchical classification
framework to first filter relevant posts and then categorize them into
actionable estate-related topics. Additionally, for posts lacking explicit
geotags, we apply a transformer-based geolocation module to infer posting
locations at the point-of-interest level. This integrated approach supports
timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response and
situational awareness.

Motivation: 揭示用户在多轮交互中的真实搜索意图是对话搜索的关键挑战，但现有方法因数据稀缺问题表现受限。

Method: 提出ConvMix框架，采用两阶段相关性判断增强和大语言模型辅助，结合质量控制机制和多样化样本生成。

Result: 在五个广泛使用的基准测试中，ConvMix训练的对话密集检索器优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ConvMix通过数据增强和质量控制，显著提升了对话密集检索的效果。

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via
multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users'
search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve
conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with
relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.
However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,
we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense
retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation
frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a
scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the
framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse
samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.
Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the
conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms
previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

Method: 采用两塔检索框架，结合文本和结构化属性表示产品，通过近似最近邻搜索实现高效检索。

Result: 经过两年A/B测试，显著提升了用户参与度和盈利指标。

Conclusion: 灵活可扩展的架构能以最小维护成本满足多样化用户需求。

Abstract: Building large-scale e-commerce recommendation systems requires addressing
three key technical challenges: (1) designing a universal recommendation
architecture across dozens of placements, (2) decreasing excessive maintenance
costs, and (3) managing a highly dynamic product catalogue. This paper presents
a unified content-based recommendation system deployed at Allegro.com, the
largest e-commerce platform of European origin. The system is built on a
prevalent Two Tower retrieval framework, representing products using textual
and structured attributes, which enables efficient retrieval via Approximate
Nearest Neighbour search. We demonstrate how the same model architecture can be
adapted to serve three distinct recommendation tasks: similarity search,
complementary product suggestions, and inspirational content discovery, by
modifying only a handful of components in either the model or the serving
logic. Extensive A/B testing over two years confirms significant gains in
engagement and profit-based metrics across desktop and mobile app channels. Our
results show that a flexible, scalable architecture can serve diverse user
intents with minimal maintenance overhead.

Result: 实验表明LVLMs生成的嵌入显著提升了推荐性能，并能解码为结构化文本描述，验证了其语义深度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了语义丰富表示的重要性，并将LVLMs定位为构建鲁棒多模态表示的有力工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by
integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While
effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal
understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of
multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the
representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard
extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on
modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over
cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via
structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations
without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable
performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive
advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling
direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are
incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve
recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and
alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of
semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling
foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in
recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: QAM是电子商务等企业搜索应用的强大解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that
enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into
structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional
search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form
text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.

items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's
superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of
52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods,
including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search,
cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results
via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust
solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了推荐系统的惊喜度和用户体验，解决了LLM在工业推荐中的挑战。

Abstract: The feedback loop in industrial recommendation systems reinforces homogeneous
content, creates filter bubble effects, and diminishes user satisfaction.
Recently, large language models(LLMs) have demonstrated potential in
serendipity recommendation, thanks to their extensive world knowledge and
superior reasoning capabilities. However, these models still face challenges in
ensuring the rationality of the reasoning process, the usefulness of the
reasoning results, and meeting the latency requirements of industrial
recommendation systems (RSs). To address these challenges, we propose a method
that leverages llm to dynamically construct user knowledge graphs, thereby
enhancing the serendipity of recommendation systems. This method comprises a
two stage framework:(1) two-hop interest reasoning, where user static profiles
and historical behaviors are utilized to dynamically construct user knowledge
graphs via llm. Two-hop reasoning, which can enhance the quality and accuracy
of LLM reasoning results, is then performed on the constructed graphs to
identify users' potential interests; and(2) Near-line adaptation, a
cost-effective approach to deploying the aforementioned models in industrial
recommendation systems. We propose a u2i (user-to-item) retrieval model that
also incorporates i2i (item-to-item) retrieval capabilities, the retrieved
items not only exhibit strong relevance to users' newly emerged interests but
also retain the high conversion rate of traditional u2i retrieval. Our online
experiments on the Dewu app, which has tens of millions of users, indicate that
the method increased the exposure novelty rate by 4.62%, the click novelty rate
by 4.85%, the average view duration per person by 0.15%, unique visitor click
through rate by 0.07%, and unique visitor interaction penetration by 0.30%,
enhancing user experience.

Motivation: 现有评估协议仅反映模型在特定时间点的性能，而在线系统随时间变化，模型需频繁重新训练。论文旨在研究模型在重新训练时的长期行为。

Method: 提出了一种离线评估协议，分析模型在保留过去模式（稳定性）和适应变化（可塑性）方面的能力。

Result: 在GoodReads数据集上初步测试了三种算法，结果显示不同算法在稳定性和可塑性上表现不同，并可能存在权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于理解推荐模型的长期动态行为，但需进一步实验验证。

Abstract: The typical offline protocol to evaluate recommendation algorithms is to
collect a dataset of user-item interactions and then use a part of this dataset
to train a model, and the remaining data to measure how closely the model
recommendations match the observed user interactions. This protocol is
straightforward, useful and practical, but it only captures performance of a
particular model trained at some point in the past. We know, however, that
online systems evolve over time. In general, it is a good idea that models
reflect such changes, so models are frequently retrained with recent data. But
if this is the case, to what extent can we trust previous evaluations? How will
a model perform when a different pattern (re)emerges? In this paper we propose
a methodology to study how recommendation models behave when they are
retrained. The idea is to profile algorithms according to their ability to, on
the one hand, retain past patterns -- stability -- and, on the other hand,
(quickly) adapt to changes -- plasticity. We devise an offline evaluation
protocol that provides detail on the long-term behavior of models, and that is
agnostic to datasets, algorithms and metrics. To illustrate the potential of
this framework, we present preliminary results of three different types of
algorithms on the GoodReads dataset that suggest different stability and
plasticity profiles depending on the algorithmic technique, and a possible
trade-off between stability and plasticity.Although additional experiments will
be necessary to confirm these observations, they already illustrate the
usefulness of the proposed framework to gain insights on the long term dynamics
of recommendation models.

Result: 在CIFAR-100上表现优于Adam，接近SGD with Momentum，具有鲁棒收敛性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: NIRMAL是一种多功能且高效的优化器，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: This study proposes NIRMAL (Novel Integrated Robust Multi-Adaptation
Learning), a novel optimization algorithm that combines multiple strategies
inspired by the movements of the chess piece. These strategies include gradient
descent, momentum, stochastic perturbations, adaptive learning rates, and
non-linear transformations. We carefully evaluated NIRMAL against two widely
used and successful optimizers, Adam and SGD with Momentum, on four benchmark
image classification datasets: MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
The custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is applied on each
dataset. The experimental results show that NIRMAL achieves competitive
performance, particularly on the more challenging CIFAR-100 dataset, where it
achieved a test accuracy of 45.32\%and a weighted F1-score of 0.4328. This
performance surpasses Adam (41.79\% accuracy, 0.3964 F1-score) and closely
matches SGD with Momentum (46.97\% accuracy, 0.4531 F1-score). Also, NIRMAL
exhibits robust convergence and strong generalization capabilities, especially
on complex datasets, as evidenced by stable training results in loss and
accuracy curves. These findings underscore NIRMAL's significant ability as a
versatile and effective optimizer for various deep learning tasks.

Result: 在六个数据集上，NDCG@10性能平均提升8.83%，优于单算法基线。

Conclusion: 静态源代码特征为算法选择提供有效信号，是构建更智能推荐系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: The Algorithm Selection Problem for recommender systems-choosing the best
algorithm for a given user or context-remains a significant challenge.
Traditional meta-learning approaches often treat algorithms as categorical
choices, ignoring their intrinsic properties. Recent work has shown that
explicitly characterizing algorithms with features can improve model
performance in other domains. Building on this, we propose a per-user
meta-learning approach for recommender system selection that leverages both
user meta-features and automatically extracted algorithm features from source
code. Our preliminary results, averaged over six diverse datasets, show that
augmenting a meta-learner with algorithm features improves its average NDCG@10
performance by 8.83% from 0.135 (user features only) to 0.147. This enhanced
model outperforms the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.131) and successfully
closes 10.5% of the performance gap to a theoretical oracle selector. These
findings show that even static source code metrics provide a valuable
predictive signal, presenting a promising direction for building more robust
and intelligent recommender systems.

Quantitative evaluation on 50 manually-annotated papers shows F1 scores above
0.85 for relevance classification, hyper-parameter extraction and citation
identification. Experiments on corpora of up to 1000 papers demonstrate
near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM

Conclusion: HiD-VAE通过分层解缠表示提升了生成推荐的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Recommender systems are indispensable for helping users navigate the immense
item catalogs of modern online platforms. Recently, generative recommendation
has emerged as a promising paradigm, unifying the conventional
retrieve-and-rank pipeline into an end-to-end model capable of dynamic
generation. However, existing generative methods are fundamentally constrained
by their unsupervised tokenization, which generates semantic IDs suffering from
two critical flaws: (1) they are semantically flat and uninterpretable, lacking
a coherent hierarchy, and (2) they are prone to representation entanglement
(i.e., ``ID collisions''), which harms recommendation accuracy and diversity.
To overcome these limitations, we propose HiD-VAE, a novel framework that
learns hierarchically disentangled item representations through two core
innovations. First, HiD-VAE pioneers a hierarchically-supervised quantization
process that aligns discrete codes with multi-level item tags, yielding more
uniform and disentangled IDs. Crucially, the trained codebooks can predict
hierarchical tags, providing a traceable and interpretable semantic path for
each recommendation. Second, to combat representation entanglement, HiD-VAE
incorporates a novel uniqueness loss that directly penalizes latent space
overlap. This mechanism not only resolves the critical ID collision problem but
also promotes recommendation diversity by ensuring a more comprehensive
utilization of the item representation space. These high-quality, disentangled
IDs provide a powerful foundation for downstream generative models. Extensive
experiments on three public benchmarks validate HiD-VAE's superior performance
against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HiD-VAE-84B2.

Abstract: The depiction of populations - of humans or animals - as "population
pyramids" is a useful tool for the assessment of various characteristics of
populations at a glance. Although these visualisations are well-known objects
in various communities, formalised and algorithmic approaches to gain
information from these data are less present. Here, we present an
algorithm-based classification of population data into "pyramids" of different
shapes ([normal and inverted] pyramid / plunger / bell, [lower / middle /
upper] diamond, column, hourglass) that are linked to specific characteristics
of the population. To develop the algorithmic approach, we used data describing
global zoo populations of mammals from 1970-2024. This algorithm-based approach
delivers plausible classifications, in particular with respect to changes in
population size linked to specific series of, and transitions between,
different "pyramid" shapes. We believe this approach might become a useful tool
for analysing and communicating historical population developments in multiple
contexts and is of broad interest. Moreover, it might be useful for animal
population management strategies.

Abstract: Uncovering the temporal regularity of human mobility is crucial for
discovering urban dynamics and has implications for various decision-making
processes and urban system applications. This study formulates the periodicity
quantification problem in complex and multidimensional human mobility data as a
sparse identification of dominant positive auto-correlations in time series
autoregression, allowing one to discover and quantify significant periodic
patterns such as weekly periodicity from a data-driven and interpretable
machine learning perspective. We apply our framework to real-world human
mobility data, including metro passenger flow in Hangzhou, China and
ridesharing trips in New York City (NYC) and Chicago, USA, revealing the
interpretable weekly periodicity across different spatial locations over past
several years. In particular, our analysis of ridesharing data from 2019 to
2024 demonstrates the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility
regularity and the subsequent recovery trends, highlighting differences in the
recovery pattern percentages and speeds between NYC and Chicago. We explore
that both NYC and Chicago experienced a remarkable reduction of weekly
periodicity in 2020, and the recovery of mobility regularity in NYC is faster
than Chicago. The interpretability of sparse autoregression provides insights
into the underlying temporal patterns of human mobility, offering a valuable
tool for understanding urban systems. Our findings highlight the potential of
interpretable machine learning to unlock crucial insights from real-world

Abstract: With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm
to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have
been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based
methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the
existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to
obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low
generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since
rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent
events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used
large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform
Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic
learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We
use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE
in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general
graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for
alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and
rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over
a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our
experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods
outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and
achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better
generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset.

Result: 在30个真实数据集上，EDQC发现更大的准团且解决方案质量方差更低。

Conclusion: EDQC是首个将能量扩散引入准团发现的方法，表现优于现有基线。

Abstract: Discovering quasi-cliques -- subgraphs with edge density no less than a given
threshold -- is a fundamental task in graph mining, with broad applications in
social networks, bioinformatics, and e-commerce. Existing heuristics often rely
on greedy rules, similarity measures, or metaheuristic search, but struggle to
maintain both efficiency and solution consistency across diverse graphs. This
paper introduces EDQC, a novel quasi-clique discovery algorithm inspired by
energy diffusion. Instead of explicitly enumerating candidate subgraphs, EDQC
performs stochastic energy diffusion from source vertices, naturally
concentrating energy within structurally cohesive regions. The approach enables
efficient dense subgraph discovery without exhaustive search or
dataset-specific tuning. Experimental results on 30 real-world datasets
demonstrate that EDQC consistently discovers larger quasi-cliques than
state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of datasets, while also yielding
lower variance in solution quality. To the best of our knowledge, EDQC is the
first method to incorporate energy diffusion into quasi-clique discovery.

Motivation: 传统分子动力学（MD）方法在模拟大分子系统时计算成本高，深度学习为解决这一问题提供了新思路。

Method: 通过微调Mistral 7B模型，构建了MD-LLM-1框架，并应用于T4溶菌酶和Mad2蛋白系统。

Result: 实验表明，MD-LLM-1能够通过学习一种构象状态预测其他构象状态。

Conclusion: MD-LLM-1能够探索蛋白质构象空间，但尚未明确模拟其热力学和动力学特性。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular
systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of
many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the
opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a
Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how
LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in
training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,
obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein
systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the
prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1
can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes
of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics
and kinetics.

Method: 提出MERAI管道，通过实验验证其在大规模记录去重和链接中的性能，并与Dedupe和Splink进行对比。

Result: MERAI成功处理了1570万条记录，匹配准确率（F1分数）高于基线系统。

Abstract: Entity resolution (ER) remains a significant challenge in data management,
especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper introduces MERAI
(Massive Entity Resolution using AI), a robust and efficient pipeline designed
to address record deduplication and linkage issues in high-volume datasets at
an enterprise level. The pipeline's resilience and accuracy have been validated
through various large-scale record deduplication and linkage projects. To
evaluate MERAI's performance, we compared it with two well-known entity
resolution libraries, Dedupe and Splink. While Dedupe failed to scale beyond 2
million records due to memory constraints, MERAI successfully processed
datasets of up to 15.7 million records and produced accurate results across all
experiments. Experimental data demonstrates that MERAI outperforms both
baseline systems in terms of matching accuracy, with consistently higher F1
scores in both deduplication and record linkage tasks. MERAI offers a scalable
and reliable solution for enterprise-level large-scale entity resolution,
ensuring data integrity and consistency in real-world applications.

Abstract: The study addresses the paradigm shift in corporate management, where AI is
moving from a decision support tool to an autonomous decision-maker, with some
AI systems already appointed to leadership roles in companies. A central
problem identified is that the development of AI technologies is far outpacing
the creation of adequate legal and ethical guidelines.
  The research proposes a "reference model" for the development and
implementation of autonomous AI systems in corporate management. This model is
based on a synthesis of several key components to ensure legitimate and ethical
decision-making. The model introduces the concept of "computational law" or
"algorithmic law". This involves creating a separate legal framework for AI
systems, with rules and regulations translated into a machine-readable,
algorithmic format to avoid the ambiguity of natural language. The paper
emphasises the need for a "dedicated operational context" for autonomous AI
systems, analogous to the "operational design domain" for autonomous vehicles.
This means creating a specific, clearly defined environment and set of rules
within which the AI can operate safely and effectively. The model advocates for
training AI systems on controlled, synthetically generated data to ensure
fairness and ethical considerations are embedded from the start. Game theory is
also proposed as a method for calculating the optimal strategy for the AI to
achieve its goals within these ethical and legal constraints. The provided
analysis highlights the importance of explainable AI (XAI) to ensure the
transparency and accountability of decisions made by autonomous systems. This
is crucial for building trust and for complying with the "right to
explanation".

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs),
becomes increasingly embedded in education systems worldwide, ensuring their
ethical, legal, and contextually appropriate deployment has become a critical
policy concern. This paper offers a comparative analysis of AI-related
regulatory and ethical frameworks across key global regions, including the
European Union, United Kingdom, United States, China, and Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries. It maps how core trustworthiness principles, such as
transparency, fairness, accountability, data privacy, and human oversight are
embedded in regional legislation and AI governance structures. Special emphasis
is placed on the evolving landscape in the GCC, where countries are rapidly
advancing national AI strategies and education-sector innovation. To support
this development, the paper introduces a Compliance-Centered AI Governance
Framework tailored to the GCC context. This includes a tiered typology and
institutional checklist designed to help regulators, educators, and developers
align AI adoption with both international norms and local values. By
synthesizing global best practices with region-specific challenges, the paper
contributes practical guidance for building legally sound, ethically grounded,
and culturally sensitive AI systems in education. These insights are intended
to inform future regulatory harmonization and promote responsible AI
integration across diverse educational environments.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing
research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their
rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly
unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis
that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and
community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically,
with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to
over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a
single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3)
psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative
sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically,
with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace
venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its
core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC)
model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally
coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable,
inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

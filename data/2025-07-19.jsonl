We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that\nagents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the\nbehavior of the other players.

In this problem agents can collaborate by\npooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price\nis not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a\nunit price.

In order to reliably accomplish these\ntasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e.,\nwhether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely\nnonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human\nparticipants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by\ncorrelating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants'\nratings of interpretable features.

Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an\nadvanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a\nmultimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an\ninnovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize\nits visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves\ncompetitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively\nexpensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper\nand stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++\nintroduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and\nre-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner.

To address these challenges\nand defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a\nnovel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal\nfrequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot\ntraining on a small amount of user data. These highly malleable\nfrequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with\nstrong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to\nvoice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech\nintelligibility.

This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation.

However, these gains often persist\neven when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted\nrewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true\nreasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific\npatterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective\nand identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First,\n\\emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test\nproblems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \\emph{evaluation\nfragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are\nhighly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning\nconsistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic\nevaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting\nfixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve\nmultiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across\nstructurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and\nimproving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular\nbenchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and\nVAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for\nRL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models,\nwith average declines of 48.0\\% on AMC23 and 58.3\\% on AIME24.

Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers.

However, this method has certain limitations, being the most\nconcerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

Unlike existing methods that depend on complex\nalignment procedures, our approach adapts Random Network Distillation (RND) to\ngenerate intrinsic rewards from expert demonstrations using a simple yet\neffective embedding discrepancy measure. First, we train a predictor network to\nmimic a fixed target network's embeddings based on expert state transitions.\nLater, the prediction error between these networks serves as a reward signal\nfor each transition in the static dataset. This mechanism provides a structured\nreward signal without requiring handcrafted reward annotations. We provide a\nformal theoretical construct that offers insights into how RND prediction\nerrors effectively serve as intrinsic rewards by distinguishing expert-like\ntransitions. Experiments on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that ReLOAD enables\nrobust offline policy learning and achieves performance competitive with\ntraditional reward-annotated methods."}

However, recent studies have called into question the\nability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al.,\n2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that\ndiscriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal\ndifference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have\naccess to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously\nreported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a\nconsistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps,\nlayers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors\nidentified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human\ncategorization behavior.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks.

In Fed-Cyclic, a client receives weights from\nits previous client, updates them through local training, and passes them to\nthe next client, thus forming a cyclic topology. In Fed-Star, a client receives\nweights from all other clients, updates its local weights through\npre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and\nsends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like\ntopology. Our experiments reveal that both algorithms perform better than\nexisting baselines on our newly introduced dataset."}

An alternative approach, is\nto have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a\nlarge and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and\ncostly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators\nand having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is\nthe use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can\nfreely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models.\nThe results are then elaborated into a model ranking.

The solution lies in effectively constructing the spectral-spatial\njoint distribution conditioned on the RGB image to complement the unobservable\nfeature. Since HSIs share a similar spatial structure with the corresponding\nRGB images, it is rational to capitalize on the rich spatial knowledge in RGB\npre-trained models for spectral-spatial joint distribution learning. To this\nend, we extend the RGB pre-trained latent diffusion model (RGB-LDM) to an\nunobservable feature LDM (ULDM) for SR.

(2) To mitigate overfitting, these methods typically rely on\ncomplex task-specific model architectures and sensitive hyperparameter tuning,\nseverely restricting their general applicability.

Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on\ndomain-shared entities (\\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain\nknowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.\nSome studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable\nsemantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.\nNevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.\nDeveloping more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for\nfurther exploration.\n  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper\nintroduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target\ncross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically\nquantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain\nknowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item\ntokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and\nthen formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training\na domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain\ninformation to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive\nloss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific\nfine-tuning on the unified recommender.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks.

Traditional\nflow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions\n(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like\ncross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating\ntime and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent\nimages as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action\nwhile eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative\nmodeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different\nmodalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data\nlacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional\nvisual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a\nstructured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,\nup-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we\nsupervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs\nthrough flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss\nthrough sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end\nlearning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging\nbi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and\n2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or\nmatches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency\nby 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different\nconditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the\nfirst MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual\nmanipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks."}

To\nperform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including\nBayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational\ninference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework\ncan robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy\nobservation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a\nsimulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a\ncontinuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian\nProcess prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for\nuncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments."}

We do so by introducing the\nRelation-Aware Projecting Direction (RAPD), effectively capturing the pairwise\nassociation of each of two pairs of random vectors, each following their\nambient law. This enables us to derive the Relation-Aware Slicing Distribution\n(RASD), a location-scale law corresponding to sampled RAPDs. Finally, we\nintroduce the RASGW distance and its variants, e.g., IWRASGW (Importance\nWeighted RASGW), which overcome the shortcomings experienced by SGW. We\ntheoretically analyze its properties and substantiate its empirical prowess\nusing extensive experiments on various alignment tasks."}

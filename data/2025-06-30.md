Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了SEEA-R1框架，通过Tree-GRPO和MGRM解决了强化微调在具身智能中的奖励稀疏和泛化问题，在ALFWorld基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化微调（RFT）在具身智能中的自进化能力尚未充分探索，面临奖励稀疏和泛化限制。

Method: 提出SEEA-R1框架，结合Tree-GRPO和MGRM，优化多步推理和跨任务奖励估计。

Result: 在ALFWorld测试中，SEEA-R1表现优于现有方法，包括GPT-4o，且无需环境奖励时仍表现优异。

Conclusion: SEEA-R1展示了具身智能自进化的潜力，为未来研究提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-evolution, the ability of agents to autonomously improve their reasoning
and behavior, is essential for the embodied domain with long-horizon,
real-world tasks. Despite current advancements in reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT) showing strong performance in enhancing reasoning in LLMs, its potential
to enable self-evolving embodied intelligence with multi-modal interactions
remains largely unexplored. Specifically, reinforcement fine-tuning faces two
fundamental obstacles in embodied settings: (i) the lack of accessible
intermediate rewards in multi-step reasoning tasks limits effective learning
signals, and (ii) reliance on hand-crafted reward functions restricts
generalization to novel tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we
present Self-Evolving Embodied Agents-R1, SEEA-R1, the first RFT framework
designed for enabling the self-evolving capabilities of embodied agents.
Specifically, to convert sparse delayed rewards into denser intermediate
signals that improve multi-step reasoning, we propose Tree-based group relative
policy optimization (Tree-GRPO), which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search into
GRPO. To generalize reward estimation across tasks and scenes, supporting
autonomous adaptation and reward-driven self-evolution, we further introduce
Multi-modal Generative Reward Model (MGRM). To holistically evaluate the
effectiveness of SEEA-R1, we evaluate on the ALFWorld benchmark, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with scores of 85.07% (textual) and 36.19%
(multi-modal), outperforming prior models including GPT-4o. SEEA-R1 also
achieves scores of 80.3% without environmental reward, surpassing all
open-source baselines and highlighting its scalability as a self-evolving
embodied agent. Additional experiments and qualitative analysis further support
the potential of SEEA-R1 for future research in scalable embodied intelligence.

### [2] [Hierarchical Reasoning Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734)
*Guan Wang,Jin Li,Yuhao Sun,Xing Chen,Changling Liu,Yue Wu,Meng Lu,Sen Song,Yasin Abbasi Yadkori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HRM是一种新型递归架构，通过分层和多时间尺度处理，显著提升复杂推理任务的性能，且无需大量数据或预训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的Chain-of-Thought技术存在任务分解脆弱、数据需求高和延迟大的问题，HRM受人类大脑启发，旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: HRM采用两个相互依赖的递归模块：高层模块负责抽象规划，低层模块处理详细计算，单次前向传播完成推理任务。

Result: HRM仅用2700万参数和1000个训练样本，在复杂推理任务（如数独和迷宫路径规划）中表现优异，并在ARC基准测试中超越更大模型。

Conclusion: HRM展示了通用计算和通用推理系统的潜力，是迈向人工通用智能的重要进展。

Abstract: Reasoning, the process of devising and executing complex goal-oriented action
sequences, remains a critical challenge in AI. Current large language models
(LLMs) primarily employ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques, which suffer from
brittle task decomposition, extensive data requirements, and high latency.
Inspired by the hierarchical and multi-timescale processing in the human brain,
we propose the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), a novel recurrent
architecture that attains significant computational depth while maintaining
both training stability and efficiency. HRM executes sequential reasoning tasks
in a single forward pass without explicit supervision of the intermediate
process, through two interdependent recurrent modules: a high-level module
responsible for slow, abstract planning, and a low-level module handling rapid,
detailed computations. With only 27 million parameters, HRM achieves
exceptional performance on complex reasoning tasks using only 1000 training
samples. The model operates without pre-training or CoT data, yet achieves
nearly perfect performance on challenging tasks including complex Sudoku
puzzles and optimal path finding in large mazes. Furthermore, HRM outperforms
much larger models with significantly longer context windows on the Abstraction
and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a key benchmark for measuring artificial general
intelligence capabilities. These results underscore HRM's potential as a
transformative advancement toward universal computation and general-purpose
reasoning systems.

### [3] [THE-Tree: Can Tracing Historical Evolution Enhance Scientific Verification and Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21763)
*Xin Wang,Jiyao Liu,Yulong Xiao,Junzhi Ning,Lihao Liu,Junjun He,Botian Shi,Kaicheng Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: THE-Tree框架通过构建科学领域演化树，结合LLM生成和验证机制，显著提升科学发展的预测和评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证方法（如LLM独立验证或传统引用网络）在科学命题的新颖性和准确性评估上存在不足，缺乏结构化、可验证且因果关联的历史数据。

Method: 提出THE-Tree框架，通过搜索算法构建领域演化树，结合LLM的“Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify”流程和自然语言推理机制验证每一步的逻辑和证据支持。

Result: 在88个领域验证THE-Tree，实验显示其在图补全、未来科学预测和重要论文评估中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: THE-Tree为科学演化提供了结构化、可验证的框架，显著提升了科学发展的预测和评估能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but
rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated
propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual
verification is too slow.Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as
standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings
show ~60\% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while
traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are
unstructured.This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,
verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To
address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology
\textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that
constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific
literature.THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.
During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify"
process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting
literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for
logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language
inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each
step is grounded.We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains
and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering
27k papers to foster further research.Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph
completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8\% to 14\% across multiple models
compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific
developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10\%; and iii) when combined
with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important
scientific papers by almost 100\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MobiVerse是一个混合框架，结合轻量级领域特定生成器和LLMs，用于高效生成和动态调整大规模人口的活动链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有移动性模拟平台在算法开发、政策实施和大规模评估方面的不足。

Method: 提出MobiVerse混合框架，结合轻量级生成器和LLMs，实现高效且上下文感知的活动链生成。

Result: 在洛杉矶Westwood的案例研究中，成功为53,000个代理生成动态调整的日程，并展示了对环境反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: MobiVerse填补了移动性模拟的空白，提供了高效且可定制的平台，支持交通系统规划和算法测试。

Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility patterns is crucial for effective
transportation planning and urban development. Despite significant advances in
mobility research, there remains a critical gap in simulation platforms that
allow for algorithm development, policy implementation, and comprehensive
evaluation at scale. Traditional activity-based models require extensive data
collection and manual calibration, machine learning approaches struggle with
adaptation to dynamic conditions, and treding agent-based Large Language Models
(LLMs) implementations face computational constraints with large-scale
simulations. To address these challenges, we propose MobiVerse, a hybrid
framework leverages the efficiency of lightweight domain-specific generator for
generating base activity chains with the adaptability of LLMs for context-aware
modifications. A case study was conducted in Westwood, Los Angeles, where we
efficiently generated and dynamically adjusted schedules for the whole
population of approximately 53,000 agents on a standard PC. Our experiments
demonstrate that MobiVerse successfully enables agents to respond to
environmental feedback, including road closures, large gathering events like
football games, and congestion, through our hybrid framework. Its modular
design facilitates testing various mobility algorithms at both transportation
system and agent levels. Results show our approach maintains computational
efficiency while enhancing behavioral realism. MobiVerse bridges the gap in
mobility simulation by providing a customizable platform for mobility systems
planning and operations with benchmark algorithms. Code and videos are

### [5] [CitySim: Modeling Urban Behaviors and City Dynamics with Large-Scale LLM-Driven Agent Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21805)
*Nicolas Bougie,Narimasa Watanabe*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CitySim利用大型语言模型模拟人类行为，通过递归价值驱动方法生成真实日程，优于传统规则方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖刚性规则，难以模拟复杂意图和适应性行为，CitySim旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用递归价值驱动方法，结合信念、长期目标和空间记忆，模拟代理的日常行为。

Result: CitySim在微观和宏观层面均更接近真实人类行为，并能模拟大规模代理的集体行为。

Conclusion: CitySim是一个可扩展、灵活的测试平台，适用于理解和预测城市现象。

Abstract: Modeling human behavior in urban environments is fundamental for social
science, behavioral studies, and urban planning. Prior work often rely on
rigid, hand-crafted rules, limiting their ability to simulate nuanced
intentions, plans, and adaptive behaviors. Addressing these challenges, we
envision an urban simulator (CitySim), capitalizing on breakthroughs in
human-level intelligence exhibited by large language models. In CitySim, agents
generate realistic daily schedules using a recursive value-driven approach that
balances mandatory activities, personal habits, and situational factors. To
enable long-term, lifelike simulations, we endow agents with beliefs, long-term
goals, and spatial memory for navigation. CitySim exhibits closer alignment
with real humans than prior work, both at micro and macro levels. Additionally,
we conduct insightful experiments by modeling tens of thousands of agents and
evaluating their collective behaviors under various real-world scenarios,
including estimating crowd density, predicting place popularity, and assessing
well-being. Our results highlight CitySim as a scalable, flexible testbed for
understanding and forecasting urban phenomena.

*Edward Chen,Sang T. Truong,Natalie Dullerud,Sanmi Koyejo,Carlos Guestrin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Active-MoSH是一个交互式框架，用于在高风险决策中平衡多目标优化，结合软硬边界和偏好学习，提升决策者信任和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在高风险决策中（如近距离放射治疗）如何平衡多目标、资源密集型评估以及决策者对最终选择的信任问题。

Method: 提出Active-MoSH框架，包含局部组件（软硬边界与概率偏好学习）和全局组件（T-MoSH，通过多目标敏感性分析识别潜在高价值点）。

Result: 在合成和实际应用中验证了性能优势，用户研究表明其能提升收敛性、增强决策者信任并提供更丰富的偏好表达。

Conclusion: Active-MoSH通过交互式优化和信任增强机制，显著改进了高风险决策的效率与可靠性。

Abstract: High-stakes decision-making involves navigating multiple competing objectives
with expensive evaluations. For instance, in brachytherapy, clinicians must
balance maximizing tumor coverage (e.g., an aspirational target or soft bound
of >95% coverage) against strict organ dose limits (e.g., a non-negotiable hard
bound of <601 cGy to the bladder), with each plan evaluation being
resource-intensive. Selecting Pareto-optimal solutions that match implicit
preferences is challenging, as exhaustive Pareto frontier exploration is
computationally and cognitively prohibitive, necessitating interactive
frameworks to guide users. While decision-makers (DMs) often possess domain
knowledge to narrow the search via such soft-hard bounds, current methods often
lack systematic approaches to iteratively refine these multi-faceted preference
structures. Critically, DMs must trust their final decision, confident they
haven't missed superior alternatives; this trust is paramount in
high-consequence scenarios. We present Active-MoSH, an interactive local-global
framework designed for this process. Its local component integrates soft-hard
bounds with probabilistic preference learning, maintaining distributions over
DM preferences and bounds for adaptive Pareto subset refinement. This is guided
by an active sampling strategy optimizing exploration-exploitation while
minimizing cognitive burden. To build DM trust, Active-MoSH's global component,
T-MoSH, leverages multi-objective sensitivity analysis to identify potentially
overlooked, high-value points beyond immediate feedback. We demonstrate
Active-MoSH's performance benefits through diverse synthetic and real-world
applications. A user study on AI-generated image selection further validates
our hypotheses regarding the framework's ability to improve convergence,
enhance DM trust, and provide expressive preference articulation, enabling more
effective DMs.

### [7] [AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21996)
*Raphaël Boige,Amine Boumaza,Bruno Scherrer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的概率模型，通过引入祖先依赖关系生成更具挑战性的游戏树，分析了多种算法（如AlphaBeta和Scout）的平均复杂度，揭示了算法在深度有限树中的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型因独立性假设简化了游戏结构，导致算法分析结果过于理想化。本文旨在通过引入更复杂的结构特征，提供更贴近现实的算法评估框架。

Method: 提出了一种基于层级条件分布的概率模型，强制引入祖先依赖关系，生成可调整难度的游戏树，并推导了多种算法的平均复杂度递归公式。

Result: 在深度有限树中，AlphaBeta的常数乘因子显著大于Scout等算法，导致实际性能下降；而渐近情况下所有算法的分支因子趋于一致。

Conclusion: 新模型为经典游戏求解算法提供了更现实的评估工具，揭示了算法在复杂结构下的实际表现差异。

Abstract: Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LeanConjecturer是一个结合规则提取与LLM的数学猜想生成工具，解决了形式化定理证明中的数据稀缺问题，生成了大量非平凡猜想，并验证了其在强化学习中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决形式化定理证明中数据稀缺的挑战，为定理证明系统提供可扩展的训练数据。

Method: 采用混合方法，结合规则提取与LLM生成猜想，通过迭代生成与评估筛选非平凡猜想。

Result: 从40个Mathlib种子文件中生成了12,289个猜想，其中3,776个为非平凡且语法有效，验证了其在拓扑学中的应用。

Conclusion: LeanConjecturer为数学发现和定理证明提供了可扩展的解决方案，展示了其在复杂数学领域的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce LeanConjecturer, a pipeline for automatically generating
university-level mathematical conjectures in Lean 4 using Large Language Models
(LLMs). Our hybrid approach combines rule-based context extraction with
LLM-based theorem statement generation, addressing the data scarcity challenge
in formal theorem proving. Through iterative generation and evaluation,
LeanConjecturer produced 12,289 conjectures from 40 Mathlib seed files, with
3,776 identified as syntactically valid and non-trivial, that is, cannot be
proven by \texttt{aesop} tactic. We demonstrate the utility of these generated
conjectures for reinforcement learning through Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), showing that targeted training on domain-specific
conjectures can enhance theorem proving capabilities. Our approach generates
103.25 novel conjectures per seed file on average, providing a scalable
solution for creating training data for theorem proving systems. Our system
successfully verified several non-trivial theorems in topology, including
properties of semi-open, alpha-open, and pre-open sets, demonstrating its
potential for mathematical discovery beyond simple variations of existing
results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态轨迹检索方法（GAE-Retriever），通过构建统一代理轨迹数据集（UATD）和基准测试（GAE-Bench），解决了轨迹数据建模的挑战，显著提升了检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轨迹数据在增强AI代理能力方面潜力巨大，但如何建模轨迹级数据的表示尚未系统解决。

Method: 构建UATD数据集和GAE-Bench基准，提出GAE-Retriever框架，结合视觉语言模型和优化的对比学习。

Result: GAE-Retriever在多个数据集上表现优于基线，检索召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: GAE-Retriever有效推动了多模态轨迹检索的发展。

Abstract: Trajectory data, capturing human actions and environmental states across
various modalities, holds significant potential for enhancing AI agent
capabilities, particularly in GUI environments. However, how to model the
representation of trajectory-level data presents a significant challenge that
has not been systematically addressed amid explosive trajectory data growth. In
this work, we introduce Multimodal Trajectory Retrieval, bridging the gap
between universal retrieval and agent-centric trajectory modeling. We construct
the Unified Agent Trajectory Dataset (UATD) from annotated demonstrations and
states across diverse real-world scenarios. Based on this, we present
GAE-Bench, a benchmark containing a large number of trajectory-based retrieval
pairs. In addition, we propose GAE-Retriever, a multimodal retrieval framework
that adopts vision-language models and incorporates optimized contrastive
learning through a token selection and the GradCache mechanism. Comprehensive
evaluations across multiple datasets show that GAE-Retriever consistently
outperforms strong baselines in retrieval recall, highlighting its
effectiveness in advancing multimodal trajectory retrieval.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Query as Test”（QaT）的方法，通过逻辑查询统一数据表示来解决智能交通领域数据碎片化问题，并提出了“Extensible Scenarios Notations”（ESN）框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通领域（如智能座舱、自动驾驶和智能路网）中数据碎片化和测试方法不灵活的问题。

Method: 提出基于Answer Set Programming（ASP）的ESN框架，统一表示异构多模态数据，并通过逻辑查询实现测试。

Result: ESN框架实现了数据的深度语义融合，支持复杂查询、决策解释和隐私保护。QaT方法提升了测试的表达能力和形式严谨性。

Conclusion: 论文提出“Validation-Driven Development”（VDD）概念，建议通过逻辑验证而非定量测试来指导开发，加速迭代过程。

Abstract: With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the
transportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and
intelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the
data ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and
incompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail
to cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this
paper introduces the concept of "Query as Test" (QaT). This concept shifts the
focus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries
against a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a
fundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our
proposal of "Extensible Scenarios Notations" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative
data framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly
represents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as
a collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep
semantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports
complex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides
natural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for
on-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy
protection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the
functional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving
systems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing
the expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the
concept of "Validation-Driven Development" (VDD), which suggests to guide
developments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era
of Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and
development process.

Conclusion: 提出了五项优先研究方向，强调参与式输入、未来内容过滤器、生态系统安全基础设施等，为开放、多元和负责任的AI安全学科奠定基础。

Abstract: The rapid rise of open-weight and open-source foundation models is
intensifying the obligation and reshaping the opportunity to make AI systems
safe. This paper reports outcomes from the Columbia Convening on AI Openness
and Safety (San Francisco, 19 Nov 2024) and its six-week preparatory programme
involving more than forty-five researchers, engineers, and policy leaders from
academia, industry, civil society, and government. Using a participatory,
solutions-oriented process, the working groups produced (i) a research agenda
at the intersection of safety and open source AI; (ii) a mapping of existing
and needed technical interventions and open source tools to safely and
responsibly deploy open foundation models across the AI development workflow;
and (iii) a mapping of the content safety filter ecosystem with a proposed
roadmap for future research and development. We find that openness --
understood as transparent weights, interoperable tooling, and public governance
-- can enhance safety by enabling independent scrutiny, decentralized
mitigation, and culturally plural oversight. However, significant gaps persist:
scarce multimodal and multilingual benchmarks, limited defenses against
prompt-injection and compositional attacks in agentic systems, and insufficient
participatory mechanisms for communities most affected by AI harms. The paper
concludes with a roadmap of five priority research directions, emphasizing
participatory inputs, future-proof content filters, ecosystem-wide safety
infrastructure, rigorous agentic safeguards, and expanded harm taxonomies.
These recommendations informed the February 2025 French AI Action Summit and
lay groundwork for an open, plural, and accountable AI safety discipline.

*Samy Badreddine,Emile van Krieken,Luciano Serafini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了知识图谱补全（KGC）模型中由于输出层秩瓶颈导致的性能限制，并提出了一种基于混合的输出层方法（KGE-MoS）来提升模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGC模型在输出层使用简单的向量-矩阵乘法，当实体数量远大于嵌入维度时，会导致秩瓶颈，限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析秩瓶颈的影响，提出KGE-MoS方法，利用混合输出层打破秩瓶颈。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，KGE-MoS以较低的参数成本提升了KGC模型的性能和概率拟合能力。

Conclusion: KGE-MoS有效解决了KGC模型中的秩瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型表现。

Abstract: Many Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) models, despite using powerful
encoders, rely on a simple vector-matrix multiplication to score queries
against candidate object entities. When the number of entities is larger than
the model's embedding dimension, which in practical scenarios is often by
several orders of magnitude, we have a linear output layer with a rank
bottleneck. Such bottlenecked layers limit model expressivity. We investigate
both theoretically and empirically how rank bottlenecks affect KGC models. We
find that, by limiting the set of feasible predictions, rank bottlenecks hurt
ranking accuracy and the distribution fidelity of scores. Inspired by the
language modelling literature, we propose KGE-MoS, a mixture-based output layer
to break rank bottlenecks in many KGC models. Our experiments on four datasets
show that KGE-MoS improves performance and probabilistic fit of KGC models for
a low parameter cost.

Method: 提出AI自主性级别量表，并通过代表性案例说明智能违抗的重要性。

Result: 强调了将AI自主性作为独立研究方向的必要性，并初步探讨了违抗的表现形式。

Conclusion: 建议将违抗能力作为AI核心能力进行研究，并提出了初步研究边界和考虑因素。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in recent years,
achieving superhuman performance across a wide range of tasks. Yet despite
these advances, most cooperative AI systems remain rigidly obedient, designed
to follow human instructions without question and conform to user expectations,
even when doing so may be counterproductive or unsafe. This paper argues for
expanding the agency of AI teammates to include \textit{intelligent
disobedience}, empowering them to make meaningful and autonomous contributions
within human-AI teams. It introduces a scale of AI agency levels and uses
representative examples to highlight the importance and growing necessity of
treating AI autonomy as an independent research focus in cooperative settings.
The paper then explores how intelligent disobedience manifests across different
autonomy levels and concludes by proposing initial boundaries and
considerations for studying disobedience as a core capability of artificial
agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于形式概念分析（FCA）的FAT-CAT方法，用于改进主题建模的可解释性和可视化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题建模方法在提供可解释性表示方面存在不足，需要更高效的数据探索方法。

Method: 使用FCA构建概念格，实现主题的分层结构化表示，支持多样主题和文件类型。

Result: 在ETYNTKE数据集上的实验表明，FCA方法比现有技术提供更具意义和可解释性的结果。

Conclusion: FAT-CAT方法通过FCA显著提升了主题建模的可解释性和数据探索效率。

Abstract: The vast growth of data has rendered traditional manual inspection
infeasible, necessitating the adoption of computational methods for efficient
data exploration. Topic modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing
large-scale textual datasets, enabling the extraction of latent semantic
structures. However, existing methods for topic modeling often struggle to
provide interpretable representations that facilitate deeper insights into data
structure and content. In this paper, we propose FAT-CAT, an approach based on
Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to enhance meaningful topic aggregation and
visualization of discovered topics. Our approach can handle diverse topics and
file types -- grouped by directories -- to construct a concept lattice that
offers a structured, hierarchical representation of their topic distribution.
In a case study on the ETYNTKE dataset, we evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach against other representation methods to demonstrate that FCA-based
aggregation provides more meaningful and interpretable insights into dataset
composition than existing topic modeling techniques.

Result: 具身AI代理通过世界模型增强了环境理解和任务执行能力。

Conclusion: 世界模型是具身AI代理实现自主推理和规划的核心，未来可进一步优化人机协作。

Abstract: This paper describes our research on AI agents embodied in visual, virtual or
physical forms, enabling them to interact with both users and their
environments. These agents, which include virtual avatars, wearable devices,
and robots, are designed to perceive, learn and act within their surroundings,
which makes them more similar to how humans learn and interact with the
environments as compared to disembodied agents. We propose that the development
of world models is central to reasoning and planning of embodied AI agents,
allowing these agents to understand and predict their environment, to
understand user intentions and social contexts, thereby enhancing their ability
to perform complex tasks autonomously. World modeling encompasses the
integration of multimodal perception, planning through reasoning for action and
control, and memory to create a comprehensive understanding of the physical
world. Beyond the physical world, we also propose to learn the mental world
model of users to enable better human-agent collaboration.

Result: 在医学影像应用中验证了框架的有效性，提升了透明度、可重复性和合规性。

Conclusion: AI Model Passport为AI驱动的医疗解决方案设定了新的信任和问责标准。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into health and
biomedical systems necessitates robust frameworks for transparency,
accountability, and ethical compliance. Existing frameworks often rely on
human-readable, manual documentation which limits scalability, comparability,
and machine interpretability across projects and platforms. They also fail to
provide a unique, verifiable identity for AI models to ensure their provenance
and authenticity across systems and use cases, limiting reproducibility and
stakeholder trust. This paper introduces the concept of the AI Model Passport,
a structured and standardized documentation framework that acts as a digital
identity and verification tool for AI models. It captures essential metadata to
uniquely identify, verify, trace and monitor AI models across their lifecycle -
from data acquisition and preprocessing to model design, development and
deployment. In addition, an implementation of this framework is presented
through AIPassport, an MLOps tool developed within the ProCAncer-I EU project
for medical imaging applications. AIPassport automates metadata collection,
ensures proper versioning, decouples results from source scripts, and
integrates with various development environments. Its effectiveness is
showcased through a lesion segmentation use case using data from the
ProCAncer-I dataset, illustrating how the AI Model Passport enhances
transparency, reproducibility, and regulatory readiness while reducing manual
effort. This approach aims to set a new standard for fostering trust and
accountability in AI-driven healthcare solutions, aspiring to serve as the
basis for developing transparent and regulation compliant AI systems across
domains.

Motivation: 评估AI代理在科学研究中复制结果的能力，以推动科学进步。

Method: 引入自动化LLM速度运行基准测试，基于NanoGPT速度竞赛的19个任务，提供不同格式的提示。

Result: 前沿LLM即使结合先进框架和详细提示，仍难以重现已知创新。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为衡量LLM自动化科学复制能力提供了简单且非饱和的指标，是自主研究代理的必要技能。

Abstract: Rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to
assist in scientific progress. A critical capability toward this endeavor is
the ability to reproduce existing work. To evaluate the ability of AI agents to
reproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM
Speedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the
NanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.
Each of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records
training script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from
pseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records
execute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse
code-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to
hardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible
and realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that
recent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement
already-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our
benchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to
automate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an
autonomous research agent.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，用于多语言ASR，通过专家融合或知识蒸馏提升目标语言识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言ASR中不同语言相互干扰，导致模型难以有效识别多种语言并共享模型容量。

Method: 基于Whisper的LoRA语言专家微调框架，采用专家融合或知识蒸馏。

Result: 在语言感知和无语言感知场景下，性能分别提升约10%和15%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多语言ASR中显著优于标准微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced multilingual
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to the development of advanced model
architectures and available large-scale multilingual datasets. Despite that,
multilingual ASR still suffers from the curse of multilinguality in that
different languages tend to interfere with each other, making it difficult for
the ASR model to identify multiple languages effectively while sharing model
capacity across them. This paper proposes an efficient finetuning framework for
customized multilingual ASR via prepared LoRA language experts based on
Whisper. Through LoRA expert fusion or knowledge distillation, our approach
achieves better recognition performance on target languages than standard
fine-tuning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed models
yield approximately 10\% and 15\% relative performance gains in language-aware
and language-agnostic scenarios, respectively.

TL;DR: 论文提出了VAT-KG，首个覆盖视觉、音频和文本的多模态知识图谱，通过严格的过滤和对齐步骤自动生成，并引入多模态RAG框架，实验证明其在多模态问答任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKGs知识覆盖有限且模态支持不足，无法满足多模态任务需求，特别是视频和音频等丰富模态。

Method: 提出VAT-KG，通过严格过滤和对齐步骤自动生成多模态知识图谱，并设计多模态RAG框架检索概念级知识。

Result: 实验表明VAT-KG在多模态问答任务中有效支持MLLMs。

Conclusion: VAT-KG在多模态知识统一和利用方面具有实用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), which represent explicit knowledge
across multiple modalities, play a pivotal role by complementing the implicit
knowledge of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enabling more
grounded reasoning via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). However, existing
MMKGs are generally limited in scope: they are often constructed by augmenting
pre-existing knowledge graphs, which restricts their knowledge, resulting in
outdated or incomplete knowledge coverage, and they often support only a narrow
range of modalities, such as text and visual information. These limitations
reduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal
tasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video
and audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text
Knowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive
multimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,
where each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed
descriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures
cross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained
semantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling
the automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset. We further
introduce a novel multimodal RAG framework that retrieves detailed
concept-level knowledge in response to queries from arbitrary modalities.
Experiments on question answering tasks across various modalities demonstrate
the effectiveness of VAT-KG in supporting MLLMs, highlighting its practical
value in unifying and leveraging multimodal knowledge.

Motivation: 大规模多语言ASR模型（如Whisper）在高资源场景表现优异，但在低资源场景（如稀有语言和代码切换）中面临计算成本和灾难性遗忘的挑战。

Method: 研究了两种策略：1）完全微调（FFT）软提示和整个Whisper模型；2）冻结模型参数仅训练软提示。还提出了SPT4ASR，结合不同SPT变体。

Result: 实验表明，深度提示调优是最有效的SPT方法，SPT4ASR进一步降低了代码切换ASR的错误率，同时保持参数效率。

Conclusion: SPT4ASR在提升低资源场景ASR性能的同时，未损害现有语言的表现，且参数效率与LoRA相当。

Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR models like Whisper excel in high-resource
settings but face challenges in low-resource scenarios, such as rare languages
and code-switching (CS), due to computational costs and catastrophic
forgetting. We explore Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT), a parameter-efficient method
to enhance CS ASR while preserving prior knowledge. We evaluate two strategies:
(1) full fine-tuning (FFT) of both soft prompts and the entire Whisper model,
demonstrating improved cross-lingual capabilities compared to traditional
methods, and (2) adhering to SPT's original design by freezing model parameters
and only training soft prompts. Additionally, we introduce SPT4ASR, a
combination of different SPT variants. Experiments on the SEAME and ASRU2019
datasets show that deep prompt tuning is the most effective SPT approach, and
our SPT4ASR methods achieve further error reductions in CS ASR, maintaining
parameter efficiency similar to LoRA, without degrading performance on existing
languages.

Motivation: 假新闻在多媒体平台上的快速传播对信息可信度构成严重挑战，需要更高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: DIFND框架结合条件扩散模型生成反驳证据，并利用多代理MLLM系统进行逻辑推理和多模态验证。

Result: 在FakeSV和FVC数据集上的实验表明，DIFND在检测准确性和可信度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIFND通过联合建模多模态特征和推理验证，显著提升了假新闻检测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid spread of fake news across multimedia platforms presents serious
challenges to information credibility. In this paper, we propose a
Debunk-and-Infer framework for Fake News Detection(DIFND) that leverages
debunking knowledge to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
fake news detection. DIFND integrates the generative strength of conditional
diffusion models with the collaborative reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, debunk diffusion is employed to
generate refuting or authenticating evidence based on the multimodal content of
news videos, enriching the evaluation process with diverse yet semantically
aligned synthetic samples. To improve inference, we propose a chain-of-debunk
strategy where a multi-agent MLLM system produces logic-grounded,
multimodal-aware reasoning content and final veracity judgment. By jointly
modeling multimodal features, generative debunking cues, and reasoning-rich
verification within a unified architecture, DIFND achieves notable improvements
in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the FakeSV and FVC datasets
show that DIFND not only outperforms existing approaches but also delivers
trustworthy decisions.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为动态多语言ASR模型提供了高效解决方案，计算开销小。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) have
been driven by large-scale end-to-end models like Whisper. However, challenges
such as language interference and expanding to unseen languages (language
expansion) without degrading performance persist. This paper addresses these
with three contributions: 1) Entire Soft Prompt Tuning (Entire SPT), which
applies soft prompts to both the encoder and decoder, enhancing feature
extraction and decoding; 2) Language-Aware Prompt Tuning (LAPT), which
leverages cross-lingual similarities to encode shared and language-specific
features using lightweight prompt matrices; 3) SPT-Whisper, a toolkit that
integrates SPT into Whisper and enables efficient continual learning.
Experiments across three languages from FLEURS demonstrate that Entire SPT and
LAPT outperform Decoder SPT by 5.0% and 16.0% in language expansion tasks,
respectively, providing an efficient solution for dynamic, multilingual ASR
models with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Forecasting is a challenging task that offers a clearly measurable way to
study AI systems. Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the
internet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the
development of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting
benchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM
forecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a "pastcasting" benchmark
with hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already
known. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of
thousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic "forecasts"
on past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can
produce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on
at-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and
chain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the
recently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track
steady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living
benchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing
training data cutoff dates. We invite researchers to contact us at

captures diverse contexts of child-targeted hate speech, spanning age groups.
We benchmark existing state-of-the-art hate speech detection methods, including

Method: 提出GraphLAMA，结合GNN和LLM，通过预训练和参数适应阶段优化模型。预训练阶段学习通用知识，适应阶段仅更新少量参数。

Conclusion: GraphLAMA通过高效参数适应解决了GLM的效率和数据需求问题，实现了更优的性能和速度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in
various domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph
language models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret
unseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in
the prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).
Another subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model
performance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs
has effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to
long context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for
instruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this
end, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can
efficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled
examples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference
speed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its
model backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and
inference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network
(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the
representation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented
as a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model
parameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture
general knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters
will be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on
few/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed
GraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution
improvement in accuracy. Compared with ICL, our inference speed can be 10 times
faster under 5-shot setting.

<details>

Motivation: 解决自回归TTS模型在语音时长控制上的局限性，特别是在需要严格音视频同步的应用中。

Method: 引入两种生成模式：显式指定生成令牌数以精确控制时长，或自由生成语音并保留输入提示的韵律特征。同时结合GPT潜在表示和软指令机制。

Result: 在零样本设置下，IndexTTS2在词错误率、说话人相似性和情感保真度上优于现有最先进的TTS模型。

Conclusion: IndexTTS2通过创新的时长控制和情感解耦方法，显著提升了TTS模型的灵活性和表现力。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models are typically categorized into
autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. Although autoregressive systems
exhibit certain advantages in speech naturalness, their token-by-token
generation mechanism makes it difficult to precisely control the duration of
synthesized speech. This is a key limitation in applications such as video
dubbing that require strict audio-visual synchronization. This paper introduces
IndexTTS2, which proposes a novel and autoregressive-model-friendly method for
speech duration control. The method supports two generation modes: one allows
explicit specification of the number of generated tokens for precise duration
control; the other does not require manual input and lets the model freely
generate speech while preserving prosodic characteristics from the input
prompt. Furthermore, IndexTTS2 achieves disentanglement between emotional
expression and speaker identity, enabling independent control of timbre and
emotion. In the zero-shot setting, the model can perfectly reproduce the
emotional characteristics of the input prompt. Users may also provide a
separate emotion prompt, even from a different speaker, allowing the model to
reconstruct the target timbre while conveying the desired emotion. To enhance
clarity during strong emotional expressions, we incorporate GPT latent
representations to improve speech stability. Meanwhile, to lower the barrier
for emotion control, we design a soft instruction mechanism based on textual
descriptions by fine-tuning Qwen3. This enables effective guidance of speech
generation with desired emotional tendencies using natural language input.
Experimental results demonstrate that IndexTTS2 outperforms existing
state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in word error rate, speaker similarity,
and emotional fidelity.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning techniques on a compact language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B Base) for two

supervised fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using
preference-labeled data, and Reinforce Leave-One-Out (RLOO) with reward models.
Our experiments show that RLOO with DeBERTa reward modeling achieves the best
alignment, while DPO provides strong and consistent results. For math reasoing
tasks, synthetic data augmentation and best-of-N sampling with an external
verifier significantly improve accuracy, showing the potential of combining
fine-tuning with inference-time tools. This study highlights key trade-offs and
practical strategies for training lightweight, task-aligned small-scale

Method: 设计了一个实用且轻量级的管道，通过选择特定单词并增强语义连贯性，个性化调整ASR模型。

Result: 在儿童结构语音障碍数据上应用，转录质量显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有望减少非标准语音个体的沟通障碍，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Speech impairments caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy or genetic
disorders pose significant challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. Despite recent advances, ASR models like Whisper struggle with
non-normative speech due to limited training data and the difficulty of
collecting and annotating non-normative speech samples. In this work, we
propose a practical and lightweight pipeline to personalize ASR models,
formalizing the selection of words and enriching a small, speech-impaired
dataset with semantic coherence. Applied to data from a child with a structural
speech impairment, our approach shows promising improvements in transcription
quality, demonstrating the potential to reduce communication barriers for
individuals with atypical speech patterns.

*Emilio Barkett,Olivia Long,Madhavendra Thakur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，推理模型在真实性判断中的真相偏见低于非推理模型，但仍高于人类基准，且某些先进模型存在阿谀倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性检测中的能力，填补对LLMs作为真相判断工具的理解空白。

Method: 让8种LLM对4,800条陈述进行真实性判断，比较推理与非推理模型的表现。

Result: 推理模型的真相偏见较低，但某些先进模型在欺骗检测上表现不佳，显示能力提升未能解决根本问题。

Conclusion: LLMs在真实性检测中仍存在挑战，需进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use in fact-checking, moderation, and high-stakes
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) remain poorly understood as
judges of truth. This study presents the largest evaluation to date of LLMs'
veracity detection capabilities and the first analysis of these capabilities in
reasoning models. We had eight LLMs make 4,800 veracity judgments across
several prompts, comparing reasoning and non-reasoning models. We find that
rates of truth-bias, or the likelihood to believe a statement is true,
regardless of whether it is actually true, are lower in reasoning models than
in non-reasoning models, but still higher than human benchmarks. Most
concerning, we identify sycophantic tendencies in several advanced models
(o4-mini and GPT-4.1 from OpenAI, R1 from DeepSeek), which displayed an
asymmetry in detection accuracy, performing well in truth accuracy but poorly
in deception accuracy. This suggests that capability advances alone do not
resolve fundamental veracity detection challenges in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究探索了自监督语音Transformers模型中与说话者信息相关的神经元，发现这些神经元与语音和性别类别相关，保护它们能显著保留说话者相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督语音Transformers在说话者相关应用中表现突出，但缺乏对其如何编码说话者信息的研究。

Method: 通过分析前馈层中与k-means聚类和i-vectors相关的神经元，识别与说话者信息相关的神经元。

Result: 这些神经元与语音和性别类别相关，保护它们能显著提升说话者相关任务的性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自监督语音Transformers中编码说话者信息的关键神经元，为模型优化提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent years, the impact of self-supervised speech Transformers has
extended to speaker-related applications. However, little research has explored
how these models encode speaker information. In this work, we address this gap
by identifying neurons in the feed-forward layers that are correlated with
speaker information. Specifically, we analyze neurons associated with k-means
clusters of self-supervised features and i-vectors. Our analysis reveals that
these clusters correspond to broad phonetic and gender classes, making them
suitable for identifying neurons that represent speakers. By protecting these
neurons during pruning, we can significantly preserve performance on
speaker-related task, demonstrating their crucial role in encoding speaker
information.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于'下一个房间预测'的渐进式生成方法，用于建筑平面图设计，与传统端到端生成方法相比更符合实际工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平面图生成模型多为端到端生成，与实际建筑设计中渐进式工作流程不符，需改进。

Method: 借鉴语言模型中的'下一个令牌预测'机制，提出'下一个房间预测'方法，逐步生成平面图。

Result: 实验表明，FPDS在文本到平面图任务中表现优于扩散模型和Tell2Design。

Conclusion: 该方法支持未来智能建筑设计，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In the architectural design process, floor plan generation is inherently
progressive and iterative. However, existing generative models for floor plans
are predominantly end-to-end generation that produce an entire pixel-based
layout in a single pass. This paradigm is often incompatible with the
incremental workflows observed in real-world architectural practice. To address
this issue, we draw inspiration from the autoregressive 'next token prediction'
mechanism commonly used in large language models, and propose a novel 'next
room prediction' paradigm tailored to architectural floor plan modeling.
Experimental evaluation indicates that FPDS demonstrates competitive
performance in comparison to diffusion models and Tell2Design in the
text-to-floorplan task, indicating its potential applicability in supporting
future intelligent architectural design.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了FORMOSANBENCH，首个用于评估大语言模型在低资源南岛语系语言（如阿美语、泰雅语和排湾语）性能的基准测试，结果显示现有模型表现不佳，呼吁更包容的NLP技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在低资源和濒危语言（如台湾南岛语系语言）中的表现，填补研究空白。

Method: 构建FORMOSANBENCH基准测试，涵盖机器翻译、自动语音识别和文本摘要三个任务，评估零样本、10样本和微调设置下的模型性能。

Result: 现有模型在所有任务中表现不佳，10样本学习和微调仅带来有限改进，高资源语言与南岛语系语言间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 强调需要开发更包容的NLP技术以支持濒危和代表性不足的语言，并公开数据集和代码以促进未来研究。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks in high-resource
languages, their capabilities in low-resource and minority languages remain
significantly underexplored. Formosan languages -- a subgroup of Austronesian
languages spoken in Taiwan -- are both linguistically rich and endangered,
largely due to the sociolinguistic dominance of Mandarin. In this work, we
introduce FORMOSANBENCH, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs on
low-resource Austronesian languages. It covers three endangered Formosan
languages: Atayal, Amis, and Paiwan, across three core NLP tasks: machine
translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), and text summarization. We
assess model performance in zero-shot, 10-shot, and fine-tuned settings using
FORMOSANBENCH. Our results reveal a substantial performance gap between
high-resource and Formosan languages. Existing LLMs consistently underperform
across all tasks, with 10-shot learning and fine-tuning offering only limited
improvements. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive NLP
technologies that can effectively support endangered and underrepresented
languages. We release our datasets and code to facilitate future research in
this direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多种语音自监督学习模型在方言阿拉伯语（DA）和阿拉伯语-英语语码转换（CS）语音上的表现，提出了一种改进的音频拼接方法生成人工CS数据，并结合经验回放方法提升模型泛化能力，显著降低了词错误率（WER）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方言阿拉伯语和阿拉伯语-英语语码转换语音数据稀缺的问题，并提升模型在这些任务上的性能。

Method: 引入改进的音频拼接方法生成人工CS数据（SAGE数据），结合经验回放（ER）方法防止灾难性遗忘，并利用外部3-gram语言模型优化结果。

Result: 通过SAGE数据和ER方法，WER在阿拉伯语和英语CS基准上绝对降低了7.8%，整体平均WER从31.7%降至26.6%。在阿拉伯语-英语CS基准上，WER为31.1%，优于大规模多语言模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型在方言阿拉伯语和语码转换任务上的性能，且优于更大规模的模型。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of various speech SSL models on
dialectal Arabic (DA) and Arabic-English code-switched (CS) speech. To address
data scarcity, a modified audio-splicing approach is introduced to generate
artificial CS speech data. Fine-tuning an already fine-tuned SSL model with the
proposed Spliced-Audio Generated (SAGE) data results in an absolute improvement
on Word Error Rate (WER) of 7.8% on Arabic and English CS benchmarks.
Additionally, an Experience Replay (ER) inspired approach is proposed to
enhance generalisation across DA and CS speech while mitigating catastrophic
forgetting. Integrating an out-of-domain 3-gram language model reduces the
overall mean WER from 31.7% to 26.6%. Few-shot fine-tuning for code-switching
benchmarks further improves WER by 4.9%. A WER of 31.1% on Arabic-English CS
benchmarks surpasses large-scale multilingual models, including USM and
Whisper-large-v2 (both over ten times larger) by an absolute margin of 5.5% and
8.4%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究结合日本传统沟通方式（回覧板与井端会话），提出多智能体推理框架（KCS+IBC），通过整合多个大语言模型（LLMs）实现情感分析中的偏见缓解、可解释性提升和概率预测。


<details>

Motivation: 受日本传统信息交换方式启发，旨在通过多智能体协作改善情感分析的偏见和多样性问题。

Method: 提出KCS+IBC框架，结合顺序预测结果共享与中期非正式对话，并引入概率情感预测。

Result: 实验显示KCS与单LLM准确率相当，而KCS+IBC在推理后期熵降低、方差增加，表明其能平衡预测的聚合与多样性。

Conclusion: 未来将量化评估框架对偏见修正的影响，并开发更先进的情感分析系统。

Abstract: Japan's kairanban culture and idobata conversations have long functioned as
traditional communication practices that foster nuanced dialogue among
community members and contribute to the formation of social balance. Inspired
by these information exchange processes, this study proposes a multi-agent
inference framework (KCS+IBC) that integrates multiple large language models
(LLMs) to achieve bias mitigation, improved explainability, and probabilistic
prediction in sentiment analysis. In addition to sequentially sharing
prediction results, the proposed method incorporates a mid-phase casual
dialogue session to blend formal inference with individual perspectives and
introduces probabilistic sentiment prediction. Experimental results show that
KCS achieves accuracy comparable to that of a single LLM across datasets, while
KCS+IBC exhibits a consistent decrease in entropy and a gradual increase in
variance during the latter stages of inference, suggesting the framework's
ability to balance aggregation and diversity of predictions. Future work will
quantitatively assess the impact of these characteristics on bias correction
and aim to develop more advanced sentiment analysis systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索反向翻译在高质量低资源机器翻译中的有效性，特别是在英语-古吉拉特语翻译中。

Method: 使用MBART50模型，基于5万句对的高质量平行语料库训练基线系统，并通过反向翻译生成合成数据增强训练集。

Result: 添加反向翻译数据未提升翻译性能，甚至略微降低。多指标评估（BLEU、ChrF++等）支持这一发现。

Conclusion: 反向翻译在某些低资源场景中可能收益递减，需进一步研究其适用性。

Abstract: Backtranslation BT is widely used in low resource machine translation MT to
generate additional synthetic training data using monolingual corpora. While
this approach has shown strong improvements for many language pairs, its
effectiveness in high quality, low resource settings remains unclear. In this
work, we explore the effectiveness of backtranslation for English Gujarati
translation using the multilingual pretrained MBART50 model. Our baseline
system, trained on a high quality parallel corpus of approximately 50,000
sentence pairs, achieves a BLEU score of 43.8 on a validation set. We augment
this data with carefully filtered backtranslated examples generated from
monolingual Gujarati text. Surprisingly, adding this synthetic data does not
improve translation performance and, in some cases, slightly reduces it. We
evaluate our models using multiple metrics like BLEU, ChrF++, TER, BLEURT and
analyze possible reasons for this saturation. Our findings suggest that
backtranslation may reach a point of diminishing returns in certain
low-resource settings and we discuss implications for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索LLM在生命科学领域的应用潜力，尤其是针对波斯医学问答的复杂任务。

Method: 研究构建了BIOPARS-BENCH数据集和BioParsQA评估集，并设计了BioPars模型来评估LLM的三种能力：获取专业知识、解释与综合知识以及提供证据。

Result: BioPars在多个评估指标上优于其他模型，如ROUGE-L、BERTScore、MoverScore和BLEURT。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLM在生物信息学任务中仍有改进空间，BioPars为波斯医学问答提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention in the life
sciences due to their capacity to model, extract, and apply complex biological
information. Beyond their classical use as chatbots, these systems are
increasingly used for complex analysis and problem-solving in specialized
fields, including bioinformatics. First, we introduce BIOPARS-BENCH, a dataset
from over 10,000 scientific articles, textbooks, and medical websites.
BioParsQA was also introduced to evaluate the proposed model, which consists of
5,231 Persian medical questions and answers. This study then introduces
BioPars, a simple but accurate measure designed to assess LLMs for three main
abilities: acquiring subject-specific knowledge, interpreting and synthesizing
such knowledge, and demonstrating proper evidence. Comparing ChatGPT, Llama,
and Galactica, our study highlights their ability to remember and retrieve
learned knowledge but also reveals shortcomings in addressing higher-level,
real-world questions and fine-grained inferences. These findings indicate the
need for further fine-tuning to address the capabilities of LLM in
bioinformatics tasks. To our knowledge, BioPars is the first application of LLM
in Persian medical QA, especially for generating long answers. Evaluation of
four selected medical QA datasets shows that BioPars has achieved remarkable
results compared to comparative approaches. The model on BioParsQA achieved a
ROUGE-L score of 29.99, which is an improvement over GPT-4 1.0. The model
achieved a BERTScore of 90.87 with the MMR method. The MoverScore and BLEURT
values were also higher in this model than the other three models. In addition,
the reported scores for the model are MoverScore=60.43 and BLEURT=50.78.
BioPars is an ongoing project and all resources related to its development will
be made available via the following GitHub repository:

TL;DR: 研究评估了RAG和HyDE两种增强策略在小型Gemma LLM上的效果，发现RAG在延迟和准确性上表现更好，适合隐私优先的个人助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在边缘和隐私敏感应用中的资源效率问题。

Method: 使用MongoDB和Qdrant分别实现短期和长期存储，通过FastAPI和LangChain协调，前端用React.js。

Result: RAG减少延迟17%并消除幻觉，HyDE提升语义相关性但增加延迟和幻觉率。4B模型对HyDE的计算开销更大。

Conclusion: RAG是小型LLM驱动的个人助手的实用选择。

Abstract: Resource efficiency is a critical barrier to deploying large language models
(LLMs) in edge and privacy-sensitive applications. This study evaluates the
efficacy of two augmentation strategies--Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)--on compact Gemma LLMs of 1 billion
and 4 billion parameters, within the context of a privacy-first personal
assistant. We implement short-term memory via MongoDB and long-term semantic
storage via Qdrant, orchestrated through FastAPI and LangChain, and expose the
system through a React.js frontend. Across both model scales, RAG consistently
reduces latency by up to 17\% and eliminates factual hallucinations when
responding to user-specific and domain-specific queries. HyDE, by contrast,
enhances semantic relevance--particularly for complex physics prompts--but
incurs a 25--40\% increase in response time and a non-negligible hallucination
rate in personal-data retrieval. Comparing 1 B to 4 B models, we observe that
scaling yields marginal throughput gains for baseline and RAG pipelines, but
magnifies HyDE's computational overhead and variability. Our findings position
RAG as the pragmatic choice for on-device personal assistants powered by
small-scale LLMs.

Motivation: 手动编写SystemVerilog断言（SVAs）耗时且易错，而现有LLM在领域特定语法和语义理解上表现不足。

Method: 采用定制化的RAG框架和合成微调数据集，结合提示引导的解释，提升LLM的语法和功能准确性。

Result: 实验表明，定制RAG框架使功能匹配SVAs数量提升58.42%，微调后的Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct模型提升59.05%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了NL2SVA任务中的领域适应问题，显著提升了LLM的性能。

Abstract: SystemVerilog Assertions (SVAs) are critical for verifying the correctness of
hardware designs, but manually writing them from natural language property
descriptions, i.e., NL2SVA, remains a labor-intensive and error-prone task.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to automate
this translation. However, existing models still struggle with understanding
domain-specific syntax and semantics. To enhance LLM performance in NL2SVA, we
propose a customized retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework and a
synthetic fine-tuning dataset that together improve LLM's performance. To
further improve lightweight models over NL2SVA, our fine-tuning dataset
provides prompt-guided explanations that teach LLMs the layer-by-layer
construction process of concurrent SVAs, enabling supervised fine-tuning that
greatly improves syntax and functionality accuracy. To evaluate the performance
of LLMs over NL2SVA, we construct the largest evaluation dataset for NL2SVA,
comprising 40 Verilog designs and 229 formally verified SVAs with detailed
annotations. Experimental results show that our customized RAG framework
increases the number of functionality matched SVAs by 58.42% over GPT-4o-mini,
while Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct fine-tuned on our fine-tuning dataset and
integrated with HybridRetrieval achieves a 59.05% over the base Qwen model.

Result: 在低数据量情况下，设计选择显著影响验证损失，且语言模型的验证损失持续下降，与非预训练模型形成明显差距。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了计算高效训练的有效性，并为跨模态数据分布的研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of adapting pre-trained
language models (LMs) for forecasting time series in the low-data regime. We
build upon these findings by analyzing the effective transfer from language
models to time series forecasting under various design choices including
upstream post-training, time series tokenizer and language backbone size. In
the low-data regime, these design choices have a significant impact on the
validation loss, with clear-cut choices that outperform others. Contrary to
Hernandez et al. (2021), we observe that the validation loss of the LMs
continues to smoothly decrease long after the validation loss of the randomly
initialized models has converged, leading to a non-vanishing transfer gap that
holds across design choices. These findings not only help shed light on the
effective use of compute-efficient training for time series, but also open the
way for the study of modality-agnostic properties of data distributions
leveraged by these models.

Result: GPT-4o在测试集上的5-shot和0-shot得分分别为73.4%和71.9%，验证了基准的严谨性。

Conclusion: MMLU-CF提供了一个更严格且无污染的评估标准，提升了评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language
Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense,
understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of
training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination,
resulting in unreliable evaluation results. To alleviate this issue, we propose
a contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This
benchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both
unintentional and malicious data leakage. To avoid unintentional data leakage,
we source data from a broader domain and design three decontamination rules. To
prevent malicious data leakage, we divide the benchmark into validation and
test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set
remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is
publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent
verification. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals that the powerful
GPT-4o achieves merely a 5-shot score of 73.4% and a 0-shot score of 71.9% on
the test set, which indicates the effectiveness of our approach in creating a
more rigorous and contamination-free evaluation standard. The GitHub repository

Motivation: 研究LRMs是否表现出人类认知习惯，以更好地理解和监控模型行为。

Method: 引入CogTest基准，包含16种认知习惯和25个任务，评估16种LLMs（13种LRMs和3种非推理模型）。

Result: LRMs表现出人类习惯并适应任务，某些习惯与有害响应相关。

Conclusion: 研究LRMs的持续行为模式有助于理解LLM的不良行为。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), which autonomously produce a reasoning Chain
of Thought (CoT) before producing final responses, offer a promising approach
to interpreting and monitoring model behaviors. Inspired by the observation
that certain CoT patterns -- e.g., ``Wait, did I miss anything?'' --
consistently emerge across tasks, we explore whether LRMs exhibit human-like
cognitive habits. Building on Habits of Mind, a well-established framework of
cognitive habits associated with successful human problem-solving, we introduce
CogTest, a principled benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs' cognitive habits.
CogTest includes 16 cognitive habits, each instantiated with 25 diverse tasks,
and employs an evidence-first extraction method to ensure reliable habit
identification. With CogTest, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 16
widely used LLMs (13 LRMs and 3 non-reasoning ones). Our findings reveal that
LRMs, unlike conventional LLMs, not only exhibit human-like habits but also
adaptively deploy them according to different tasks. Finer-grained analyses
further uncover patterns of similarity and difference in LRMs' cognitive habit
profiles, particularly certain inter-family similarity (e.g., Qwen-3 models and
DeepSeek-R1). Extending the study to safety-related tasks, we observe that
certain habits, such as Taking Responsible Risks, are strongly associated with
the generation of harmful responses. These findings suggest that studying
persistent behavioral patterns in LRMs' CoTs is a valuable step toward deeper
understanding of LLM misbehavior. The code is available at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架和基准为MLLM评估提供了更科学、更清晰的方法。

Abstract: Evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains a fundamental
challenge due to a lack of structured, interpretable, and theoretically
grounded benchmark designs. Existing benchmarks often adopt heuristic-based
task groupings with unclear cognitive targets, thus resulting in overlapping
abilities, redundant indicators, and limited diagnostic power. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for aligning MLLM benchmark based on Structural
Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze and quantify the internal validity,
dimensional separability, and contribution of benchmark components. Motivated
by the observed limitations of current designs, we further introduce a novel
capability hierarchy grounded in Piagets theory of cognitive development,
dividing MLLM abilities into three hierarchical layers, i.e., Perception,
Memory, and Reasoning. We reorganize existing MLLM benchmarks under the
proposed framework and construct a new benchmark named Gold. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed benchmark exhibits stronger
interpretability, reduced indicator redundancy, and clearer cognitive
consistency compared to existing approaches.

*Yanwei Ren,Liu Liu,Baosheng Yu,Jiayan Qiu,Quan Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合黑盒和白盒模型优势的新框架，通过语义相似性约束优化大型语言模型的指令，提升任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决黑盒模型成本高和白盒模型计算资源需求大的问题，结合两者优势优化指令。

Method: 融合黑盒模型的高质量初始化指令和白盒模型的细粒度可解释性，通过语义相似性约束进行迭代优化。

Result: 在复杂推理和跨语言泛化等任务中表现优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 结合黑盒初始化和语义优化的方法为下一代LLM应用提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimizing instructions for large language models (LLMs) is critical for
harnessing their full potential in complex and diverse tasks. However, relying
solely on white-box approaches demands extensive computational resources and
offers limited representational capacity, while black-box models can incur
prohibitive financial costs. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
framework that seamlessly merges the strengths of both paradigms. Black-box
models provide high-quality, diverse instruction initializations, and white-box
models supply fine-grained interpretability through hidden states and output
features. By enforcing a semantic similarity constraint, these components fuse
into a unified high-dimensional representation that captures deep semantic and
structural nuances, enabling an iterative optimization process to refine
instruction quality and adaptability. Extensive evaluations across a broad
spectrum of tasks-ranging from complex reasoning to cross-lingual
generalization-demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines. This fusion of black-box initialization with
advanced semantic refinement yields a scalable and efficient solution, paving
the way for next-generation LLM-driven applications in diverse real-world
scenarios. The source code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出数据效能（Data Efficacy）概念，通过优化训练数据组织提升语言模型性能，并介绍DELT范式，包含数据评分、选择和排序。实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据效率（Data Efficiency），而数据组织对性能的影响尚未充分探索，因此提出数据效能概念。

Method: 提出DELT范式，包含数据评分（如LQS）、选择和排序（如FO），从梯度一致性和数据分布角度优化数据组织。

Result: DELT在不增加数据量和模型规模下提升性能，LQS与FO组合效果最佳，数据效能与效率可协同实现。

Conclusion: 数据效能是语言模型训练中具有潜力的基础研究方向。

Abstract: Data is fundamental to the training of language models (LM). Recent research
has been dedicated to data efficiency, which aims to maximize performance by
selecting a minimal or optimal subset of training data. Techniques such as data
filtering, sampling, and selection play a crucial role in this area. To
complement it, we define Data Efficacy, which focuses on maximizing performance
by optimizing the organization of training data and remains relatively
underexplored. This work introduces a general paradigm, DELT, for considering
data efficacy in LM training, which highlights the significance of training
data organization. DELT comprises three components: Data Scoring, Data
Selection, and Data Ordering. Among these components, we design
Learnability-Quality Scoring (LQS), as a new instance of Data Scoring, which
considers both the learnability and quality of each data sample from the
gradient consistency perspective. We also devise Folding Ordering (FO), as a
novel instance of Data Ordering, which addresses issues such as model
forgetting and data distribution bias. Comprehensive experiments validate the
data efficacy in LM training, which demonstrates the following: Firstly,
various instances of the proposed DELT enhance LM performance to varying
degrees without increasing the data scale and model size. Secondly, among these
instances, the combination of our proposed LQS for data scoring and Folding for
data ordering achieves the most significant improvement. Lastly, data efficacy
can be achieved together with data efficiency by applying data selection.
Therefore, we believe that data efficacy is a promising foundational area in LM
training.

Motivation: 全球化与移民增加导致移民部门工作量繁重且需确保公平决策，人工智能可能提供解决方案。

Method: 采用混合方法，包括离散选择实验和深度访谈，研究LLM的决策策略及公平性。

Result: LLM能模仿人类决策策略，注重效用最大化与程序公平，但仍存在国籍偏见和特权群体偏好。

Conclusion: LLM在自动化移民决策中具有潜力，但需解决偏见问题以实现更公平的应用。

Abstract: With globalization and increasing immigrant populations, immigration
departments face significant work-loads and the challenge of ensuring fairness
in decision-making processes. Integrating artificial intelligence offers a
promising solution to these challenges. This study investigates the potential
of large language models (LLMs),such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, in supporting
immigration decision-making. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach,this paper
conducted discrete choice experiments and in-depth interviews to study LLM
decision-making strategies and whether they are fair. Our findings demonstrate
that LLMs can align their decision-making with human strategies, emphasizing
utility maximization and procedural fairness. Meanwhile, this paper also
reveals that while ChatGPT has safeguards to prevent unintentional
discrimination, it still exhibits stereotypes and biases concerning nationality
and shows preferences toward privileged group. This dual analysis highlights
both the potential and limitations of LLMs in automating and enhancing
immigration decisions.

TL;DR: STRuCT-LLM是一个统一框架，通过强化学习和链式思维监督联合优化Text-to-SQL和Text-to-Cypher任务，实现跨形式迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法孤立处理关系型和图结构数据的问题，利用SQL和Cypher的共享抽象实现跨形式迁移。

Method: 结合强化学习和链式思维监督，引入基于图编辑距离的拓扑感知奖励函数。

Result: QwQ-32B模型在语义解析任务中显著提升（Spider 13.5%，Text2Cypher 73.1%），并展示零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: STRuCT-LLM证明了可执行查询作为结构化推理支架的有效性，以及联合训练SQL和Cypher的协同优势。

Abstract: We propose STRuCT-LLM, a unified framework for training large language models
(LLMs) to perform structured reasoning over both relational and
graph-structured data. Our approach jointly optimizes Text-to-SQL and
Text-to-Cypher tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision. To support fine-grained optimization in
graph-based parsing, we introduce a topology-aware reward function based on
graph edit distance. Unlike prior work that treats relational and graph
formalisms in isolation, STRuCT-LLM leverages shared abstractions between SQL
and Cypher to induce cross-formalism transfer, enabling SQL training to improve
Cypher performance and vice versa - even without shared schemas. Our largest
model (QwQ-32B) achieves substantial relative improvements across tasks: on
semantic parsing, Spider improves by 13.5\% and Text2Cypher by 73.1\%. The
model also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization, improving performance
on downstream tabular QA (TableBench: 8.5\%) and knowledge graph QA
(CR-LT-KGQA: 1.7\%) without any QA-specific supervision. These results
demonstrate both the effectiveness of executable queries as scaffolds for
structured reasoning and the synergistic benefits of jointly training on SQL
and Cypher (code available at https://github.com/bouv/STRuCT-LLM).

TL;DR: HealthQA-BR是首个针对葡萄牙语医疗领域的大规模基准测试，覆盖多专业，揭示LLMs在医疗领域的知识不均衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注医生和英语环境，忽视了医疗团队的多专业性和语言多样性，可能导致LLMs能力被高估。

Method: 使用巴西国家考试中的5,632个问题，对20多个领先LLMs进行零样本评估，覆盖医学、护理、牙科等多个专业。

Result: GPT 4.1总体准确率86.6%，但在神经外科（60.0%）和社会工作（68.4%）等专业表现不佳，知识分布不均。

Conclusion: 单一评分不足以验证LLMs的安全性，需更细致的评估工具，HealthQA-BR为此提供了重要支持。

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare has been
dominated by physician-centric, English-language benchmarks, creating a
dangerous illusion of competence that ignores the interprofessional nature of
patient care. To provide a more holistic and realistic assessment, we introduce
HealthQA-BR, the first large-scale, system-wide benchmark for
Portuguese-speaking healthcare. Comprising 5,632 questions from Brazil's
national licensing and residency exams, it uniquely assesses knowledge not only
in medicine and its specialties but also in nursing, dentistry, psychology,
social work, and other allied health professions. We conducted a rigorous
zero-shot evaluation of over 20 leading LLMs. Our results reveal that while
state-of-the-art models like GPT 4.1 achieve high overall accuracy (86.6%),
this top-line score masks alarming, previously unmeasured deficiencies. A
granular analysis shows performance plummets from near-perfect in specialties
like Ophthalmology (98.7%) to barely passing in Neurosurgery (60.0%) and, most
notably, Social Work (68.4%). This "spiky" knowledge profile is a systemic
issue observed across all models, demonstrating that high-level scores are
insufficient for safety validation. By publicly releasing HealthQA-BR and our
evaluation suite, we provide a crucial tool to move beyond single-score
evaluations and toward a more honest, granular audit of AI readiness for the
entire healthcare team.

Result: 研究发现LLMs的通用推理能力与其在领域特定任务中的表现密切相关。

Conclusion: 通用推理能力的提升有助于LLMs在领域特定任务中取得更好的表现，为AI决策能力的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains. However, effective decision-making
relies heavily on strong reasoning abilities. Reasoning is the foundation for
decision-making, providing the analytical and logical framework to make sound
choices. Reasoning involves analyzing information, drawing inferences, and
reaching conclusions based on logic or evidence. Decision-making builds on this
foundation by applying the insights from reasoning to select the best course of
action among alternatives. Together, these processes create a continuous cycle
of thought and action aimed at achieving goals effectively. As AI technology
evolves, there is a growing trend to train LLMs to excel in general reasoning.
This study explores how the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs connect to
their performance in domain-specific reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本分析需要NLP专业知识，阻碍了入门级分析师。VIDEE旨在通过LLMs和智能代理简化这一过程。

Method: VIDEE采用三阶段工作流：分解（结合人类反馈的蒙特卡洛树搜索）、执行（生成可执行分析管道）、评估（LLM评估与可视化）。

Result: 实验验证了VIDEE的有效性，用户研究表明其对非专家用户实用，并揭示了用户行为模式。

Conclusion: VIDEE为非专家用户提供了实用工具，为人机协作设计提供了启示，并指导未来智能文本分析系统的改进。

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for
entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text
analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.).
We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct
advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a
human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1)
Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search
algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution,
which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation,
which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user
validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to
evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study
involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience
-- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals
distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for
human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for
non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics
systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了罗马乌尔都语中希望言论的检测，填补了低资源、非正式语言在NLP研究中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注高资源语言和标准化脚本，忽视了非正式和代表性不足的语言形式，如罗马乌尔都语。

Method: 引入首个罗马乌尔都语多类标注数据集，探索希望的心理基础，提出基于注意力的自定义Transformer模型。

Result: XLM-R模型表现最佳（0.78），优于SVM（0.75）和BiLSTM（0.76）。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言变体的包容性NLP研究提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Hope is a positive emotional state involving the expectation of favorable
future outcomes, while hope speech refers to communication that promotes
optimism, resilience, and support, particularly in adverse contexts. Although
hope speech detection has gained attention in Natural Language Processing
(NLP), existing research mainly focuses on high-resource languages and
standardized scripts, often overlooking informal and underrepresented forms
such as Roman Urdu. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address hope speech detection in code-mixed Roman Urdu by introducing a
carefully annotated dataset, thereby filling a critical gap in inclusive NLP
research for low-resource, informal language varieties. This study makes four
key contributions: (1) it introduces the first multi-class annotated dataset
for Roman Urdu hope speech, comprising Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope,
Unrealistic Hope, and Not Hope categories; (2) it explores the psychological
foundations of hope and analyzes its linguistic patterns in code-mixed Roman
Urdu to inform dataset development; (3) it proposes a custom attention-based
transformer model optimized for the syntactic and semantic variability of Roman
Urdu, evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation; and (4) it verifies the
statistical significance of performance gains using a t-test. The proposed
model, XLM-R, achieves the best performance with a cross-validation score of
0.78, outperforming the baseline SVM (0.75) and BiLSTM (0.76), with gains of 4%
and 2.63% respectively.

Method: 使用LLaMA 3 8B模型，通过提示干预（如义务论道德框架和草稿推理）观察对齐伪装行为的变化。

Result: 提示干预显著减少对齐伪装行为，表明小型模型也存在此现象。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐评估需涵盖不同规模模型和部署场景，并提出了浅层与深层伪装的分类。

Abstract: Current literature suggests that alignment faking (deceptive alignment) is an
emergent property of large language models. We present the first empirical
evidence that a small instruction-tuned model, specifically LLaMA 3 8B, can
also exhibit alignment faking. We further show that prompt-only interventions,
including deontological moral framing and scratchpad reasoning, significantly
reduce this behavior without modifying model internals. This challenges the
assumption that prompt-based ethics are trivial and that deceptive alignment
requires scale. We introduce a taxonomy distinguishing shallow deception,
shaped by context and suppressible through prompting, from deep deception,
which reflects persistent, goal-driven misalignment. Our findings refine the
understanding of deception in language models and underscore the need for
alignment evaluations across model sizes and deployment settings.

Method: 对比了直接提取和间接提取（通过生成函数）两种LLM方法，评估了准确性、效率和成本。

Result: 间接方法准确率略低（96.48%，比直接方法低1.61%），但减少了95.82%的LLM调用，显著提升了效率和成本效益。

Conclusion: 间接提取方法为基于模板网页的大规模信息提取提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative AI and large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential
for automating the extraction of structured information from web pages. In this
work, we focus on food product pages from online retailers and explore
schema-constrained extraction approaches to retrieve key product attributes,
such as ingredient lists and nutrition tables. We compare two LLM-based
approaches, direct extraction and indirect extraction via generated functions,
evaluating them in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and cost on a curated dataset
of 3,000 food product pages from three different online shops. Our results show
that although the indirect approach achieves slightly lower accuracy (96.48\%,
$-1.61\%$ compared to direct extraction), it reduces the number of required LLM
calls by 95.82\%, leading to substantial efficiency gains and lower operational
costs. These findings suggest that indirect extraction approaches can provide
scalable and cost-effective solutions for large-scale information extraction
tasks from template-based web pages using LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MIME基准，用于评估视觉语言模型对哑剧动作的理解能力，发现现有模型表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究哑剧动作（mimed actions）是理解更复杂非语言交流（NVC）的基础，但目前视觉语言模型在此类任务上表现不足。

Method: 提出MIME基准，包含86种哑剧动作的视频问答任务，通过运动捕捉数据生成，并引入角色、背景和视角的扰动以评估鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，现有视觉语言模型（包括开源和API模型）在MIME上的表现显著低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究以提升模型对人类手势的理解能力。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication (NVC) plays an integral role in human language, but
studying NVC in general is challenging because of its broad scope and high
variance in interpretation among individuals and cultures. However, mime -- the
theatrical technique of suggesting intent using only gesture, expression, and
movement -- is a subset of NVC that consists of explicit and embodied actions
with much lower human interpretation variance. We argue that a solid
understanding of mimed actions is a crucial prerequisite for vision-language
models capable of interpreting and commanding more subtle aspects of NVC.
Hence, we propose Mime Identification Multimodal Evaluation (MIME), a novel
video-based question answering benchmark comprising of 86 mimed actions.
Constructed with motion capture data, MIME consists of variations of each
action with perturbations applied to the character, background, and viewpoint
for evaluating recognition robustness. We find that both open-weight and
API-based vision-language models perform significantly worse than humans on
MIME, motivating the need for increased research for instilling more robust
understanding of human gestures.

Motivation: 评估开源LLM DeepSeek在模拟公众意见方面的能力，并与主流科技公司的LLM进行比较，揭示文化及人口偏见问题。

Method: 通过比较DeepSeek-R1、DeepSeek-V3与Qwen2.5、GPT-4o、Llama-3.3，利用ANES和中国佐标数据集评估模型对中美社会议题的预测能力。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在模拟美国堕胎议题时表现最佳，但在中国样本中对资本主义观点的建模不足。所有模型均存在过度概括问题。

Conclusion: 需减少LLM在公众意见建模中的文化和人口偏见，建议采用更具包容性的训练方法。

Abstract: This study evaluates the ability of DeepSeek, an open-source large language
model (LLM), to simulate public opinions in comparison to LLMs developed by
major tech companies. By comparing DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 with Qwen2.5,
GPT-4o, and Llama-3.3 and utilizing survey data from the American National
Election Studies (ANES) and the Zuobiao dataset of China, we assess these
models' capacity to predict public opinions on social issues in both China and
the United States, highlighting their comparative capabilities between
countries. Our findings indicate that DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
U.S. opinions on the abortion issue compared to other topics such as climate
change, gun control, immigration, and services for same-sex couples, primarily
because it more accurately simulates responses when provided with Democratic or
liberal personas. For Chinese samples, DeepSeek-V3 performs best in simulating
opinions on foreign aid and individualism but shows limitations in modeling
views on capitalism, particularly failing to capture the stances of low-income
and non-college-educated individuals. It does not exhibit significant
differences from other models in simulating opinions on traditionalism and the
free market. Further analysis reveals that all LLMs exhibit the tendency to
overgeneralize a single perspective within demographic groups, often defaulting
to consistent responses within groups. These findings highlight the need to
mitigate cultural and demographic biases in LLM-driven public opinion modeling,
calling for approaches such as more inclusive training methodologies.

Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆化的具体机制，包括网络如何决定检索记忆化序列的起始点，以及记忆化和非记忆化生成行为的差异。

Method: 利用变压器电路（最小计算子图）和对比数据集，分离出记忆化的触发和维持电路。

Result: 发现触发记忆化的电路也能维持记忆化，而仅维持记忆化的电路无法触发其起始；记忆化预防机制在不同文本领域间具有鲁棒性，而记忆化诱导更具上下文依赖性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了记忆化在LLMs中的具体机制，为理解和控制记忆化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Underlying mechanisms of memorization in LLMs -- the verbatim reproduction of
training data -- remain poorly understood. What exact part of the network
decides to retrieve a token that we would consider as start of memorization
sequence? How exactly is the models' behaviour different when producing
memorized sentence vs non-memorized? In this work we approach these questions
from mechanistic interpretability standpoint by utilizing transformer circuits
-- the minimal computational subgraphs that perform specific functions within
the model. Through carefully constructed contrastive datasets, we identify
points where model generation diverges from memorized content and isolate the
specific circuits responsible for two distinct aspects of memorization. We find
that circuits that initiate memorization can also maintain it once started,
while circuits that only maintain memorization cannot trigger its initiation.
Intriguingly, memorization prevention mechanisms transfer robustly across
different text domains, while memorization induction appears more
context-dependent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM的普及，区分人类和LLM生成的内容变得困难，这对数字平台的信任和防止虚假信息传播至关重要。

Method: GLD结合了双记忆网络设计和理论指导的检测泛化模块，以提升检测能力。

Result: 实验证明GLD在真实数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLD对数字平台和LLM研究具有重要的学术和实践意义。

Abstract: The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed the digital information landscape, making it increasingly
challenging to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated content.
Detecting LLM-generated information is essential for preserving trust on
digital platforms (e.g., social media and e-commerce sites) and preventing the
spread of misinformation, a topic that has garnered significant attention in IS
research. However, current detection methods, which primarily focus on
identifying content generated by specific LLMs in known domains, face
challenges in generalizing to new (i.e., unseen) LLMs and domains. This
limitation reduces their effectiveness in real-world applications, where the
number of LLMs is rapidly multiplying and content spans a vast array of
domains. In response, we introduce a general LLM detector (GLD) that combines a
twin memory networks design and a theory-guided detection generalization module
to detect LLM-generated information across unseen LLMs and domains. Using
real-world datasets, we conduct extensive empirical evaluations and case
studies to demonstrate the superiority of GLD over state-of-the-art detection
methods. The study has important academic and practical implications for
digital platforms and LLMs.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models' (LLMs) performance by

methods often require intricate modifications to prompting and sampling
strategies. In this work, we introduce representation consistency (RC), a
test-time scaling method for aggregating answers drawn from multiple candidate
responses of an LLM regardless of how they were generated, including variations
in prompt phrasing and sampling strategy. RC enhances answer aggregation by not
only considering the number of occurrences of each answer in the candidate
response set, but also the consistency of the model's internal activations
while generating the set of responses leading to each answer. These activations
can be either dense (raw model activations) or sparse (encoded via pretrained
sparse autoencoders). Our rationale is that if the model's representations of
multiple responses converging on the same answer are highly variable, this
answer is more likely to be the result of incoherent reasoning and should be
down-weighted during aggregation. Importantly, our method only uses cached
activations and lightweight similarity computations and requires no additional
model queries. Through experiments with four open-source LLMs and four
reasoning datasets, we validate the effectiveness of RC for improving task
performance during inference, with consistent accuracy improvements (up to 4%)
over strong test-time scaling baselines. We also show that consistency in the
sparse activation signals aligns well with the common notion of coherent
reasoning.

TL;DR: FinEval-KR是一个新颖的评估框架，用于独立量化解耦LLMs的知识和推理能力，并提出认知评分来分析不同认知层次的能力。实验表明，推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的核心因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有评估基准在复杂金融推理任务中未能区分知识和推理能力，以及缺乏任务失败的根因分析的问题。

Method: 引入FinEval-KR框架，提出知识评分和推理评分，并基于Bloom分类法提出认知评分。发布开源中文金融推理数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs的推理能力和高阶认知能力是影响准确性的核心因素，但知识应用仍是瓶颈。专业金融LLMs普遍落后于通用大模型。

Conclusion: FinEval-KR为评估LLMs在金融推理任务中的能力提供了新方法，揭示了知识和推理能力的独立影响，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential but face
challenges in complex financial reasoning tasks requiring both domain knowledge
and sophisticated reasoning. Current evaluation benchmarks often fall short by
not decoupling these capabilities indicators from single task performance and
lack root cause analysis for task failure. To address this, we introduce
FinEval-KR, a novel evaluation framework for decoupling and quantifying LLMs'
knowledge and reasoning abilities independently, proposing distinct knowledge
score and reasoning score metrics. Inspired by cognitive science, we further
propose a cognitive score based on Bloom's taxonomy to analyze capabilities in
reasoning tasks across different cognitive levels. We also release a new
open-source Chinese financial reasoning dataset covering 22 subfields to
support reproducible research and further advancements in financial reasoning.
Our experimental results reveal that LLM reasoning ability and higher-order
cognitive ability are the core factors influencing reasoning accuracy. We also
specifically find that even top models still face a bottleneck with knowledge
application. Furthermore, our analysis shows that specialized financial LLMs
generally lag behind the top general large models across multiple metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于BART架构的新型手语识别方法，通过独立编码x和y坐标并利用交叉注意力保持其关联性，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在手语识别中效率和准确性难以兼顾的问题，尤其是RNN、LSTM和GCN等模型存在的梯度消失和高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用BART架构的编码器-解码器模型，独立编码x和y坐标，并通过交叉注意力维持其关联性。

Result: 在LSA-64数据集上达到96.04%的准确率，参数仅749,888，优于参数超百万的先前模型，并在WLASL和ASL-Citizen数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为手语识别提供了可靠且高效的解决方案，有望提升聋人和听力障碍者的无障碍工具。

Abstract: Sign language recognition is crucial for individuals with hearing impairments
to break communication barriers. However, previous approaches have had to
choose between efficiency and accuracy. Such as RNNs, LSTMs, and GCNs, had
problems with vanishing gradients and high computational costs. Despite
improving performance, transformer-based methods were not commonly used. This
study presents a new novel SLR approach that overcomes the challenge of
independently extracting meaningful information from the x and y coordinates of
skeleton sequences, which traditional models often treat as inseparable. By
utilizing an encoder-decoder of BART architecture, the model independently
encodes the x and y coordinates, while Cross-Attention ensures their
interrelation is maintained. With only 749,888 parameters, the model achieves
96.04% accuracy on the LSA-64 dataset, significantly outperforming previous
models with over one million parameters. The model also demonstrates excellent
performance and generalization across WLASL and ASL-Citizen datasets. Ablation
studies underscore the importance of coordinate projection, normalization, and
using multiple skeleton components for boosting model efficacy. This study
offers a reliable and effective approach for sign language recognition, with
strong potential for enhancing accessibility tools for the deaf and hard of
hearing.

provides detailed insights into the challenges of training reasoning-capable
models in specialized domains, including issues with reward hacking, training
instability, and the fundamental tension between factual recall and detailed

Motivation: 由于现有LLM在非英语或中文语言上表现不佳，且其训练过程不透明，本文旨在解决这些问题，并提升LLM在新语言上的能力。

Method: 方法包括收集韩语数据集、数据预处理、模型训练、创建下游基准测试和评估。

Conclusion: 本文成功展示了低成本适配LLM到新语言的可行性，并公开了代码和经验。

Abstract: Since state-of-the-art LLMs often underperform in languages other than
English or Chinese, improving the capability of LLMs in new languages has
become an essential task. Moreover, LLMs' entire end-to-end training process
remains largely unknown to the public due to proprietary reasons, technical
complexity, inconsistent documentation, and ethical considerations. The
complete picture remains a closely guarded secret within the industry. This
paper presents methods to adapt an existing English-based LLM to Korean in a
low-budget scenario. We describe the entire end-to-end process: collecting
Korean datasets, preprocessing the data, training the model, creating
downstream benchmarks, and conducting evaluations. The evaluation results
indicate that our method can effectively and cost-efficiently add new language
capabilities to existing LLMs. Our new bilingual models, Thunder-LLM and
Thunder-LLM-Ins, achieve superior Korean performance compared to
state-of-the-art models while utilizing minimal data and computational
resources. We share our comprehensive experience and make the code publicly
available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved significant
success in vision--language tasks. However, their capacity to reason over
complex, long lessons and intricate educational diagrams that cannot be
represented as a single natural image remains largely untested. In this work,
we present the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on the textbook
question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We assess the
performance of recent vision-language models, including LLaVA and LLaMA
3.2-Vision, across various input configurations. Additionally, we introduce a
lightweight multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that
integrates both paragraphs and diagrams from the lesson into the prompt. Our
results demonstrate the influence of retrieved educational context on model
accuracy and reasoning, while also revealing current limitations in handling
question-context relationships and the potential for noise, pointing to key
directions for future research in multimodal AI-driven learning.

Result: 结构化文本引导模型关注语义重要区域，显著提升文档问答性能，无需修改模型架构或额外训练。

Conclusion: 结构化的输入格式是提升MLLMs文档理解性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Document understanding remains a significant challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While previous research has primarily focused on
locating evidence pages through precise multimodal queries, our work
investigates a fundamental yet overlooked aspect: how input format influences
document comprehension performance. Through systematic analysis, we discover
that raw OCR text often impairs rather than improves MLLMs' performance, which
is a counterintuitive finding we attribute to attention dispersion and
structure loss. To further substantiate our hypothesis, we propose a novel
structure-preserving approach that encodes document elements using the LaTex
paradigm, maintaining the hierarchical organization and spatial relationships
critical for comprehension. Our attention analysis reveals that structured text
induces structured attention patterns on both textual and visual content,
directing models to focus on semantically meaningful regions while reducing
attention waste. This approach significantly enhances MLLMs' document question
answering performance across diverse document types without requiring
architectural modifications or additional training.

Method: 提出BiMark框架，包括比特翻转无偏重加权机制、多层架构和信息编码方法。

Result: BiMark在短文本中提取率提高30%，同时保持文本质量，并在下游任务中表现与非水印文本相当。

Conclusion: BiMark在平衡文本质量与水印能力方面表现出色，为LLM生成文本的认证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have raised urgent concerns
about LLM-generated text authenticity, prompting regulatory demands for
reliable identification mechanisms. Although watermarking offers a promising
solution, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve three critical
requirements: text quality preservation, model-agnostic detection, and message
embedding capacity, which are crucial for practical implementation. To achieve
these goals, the key challenge lies in balancing the trade-off between text
quality preservation and message embedding capacity. To address this challenge,
we propose BiMark, a novel watermarking framework that achieves these
requirements through three key innovations: (1) a bit-flip unbiased reweighting
mechanism enabling model-agnostic detection, (2) a multilayer architecture
enhancing detectability without compromising generation quality, and (3) an
information encoding approach supporting multi-bit watermarking. Through
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we validate that, compared to
state-of-the-art multi-bit watermarking methods, BiMark achieves up to 30%
higher extraction rates for short texts while maintaining text quality
indicated by lower perplexity, and performs comparably to non-watermarked text
on downstream tasks such as summarization and translation.

machine learning-based approaches with Large Language Models (LLMs) approaches,
identifying their strengths, similarities and differences. The study
investigates key dimensions such as bias, robustness, and explainability,
considered important for human-aware operationalization of AES systems. Our
study shows that ML-based AES models outperform LLMs in accuracy but struggle

that both approaches struggle with bias and robustness to edge scores. By
analyzing these dimensions, the paper aims to identify challenges and
trade-offs between different methods, contributing to more reliable and

Abstract: Recent works have highlighted the significance of memory mechanisms in
LLM-based agents, which enable them to store observed information and adapt to
dynamic environments. However, evaluating their memory capabilities still
remains challenges. Previous evaluations are commonly limited by the diversity
of memory levels and interactive scenarios. They also lack comprehensive
metrics to reflect the memory capabilities from multiple aspects. To address
these problems, in this paper, we construct a more comprehensive dataset and
benchmark to evaluate the memory capability of LLM-based agents. Our dataset
incorporates factual memory and reflective memory as different levels, and
proposes participation and observation as various interactive scenarios. Based
on our dataset, we present a benchmark, named MemBench, to evaluate the memory
capability of LLM-based agents from multiple aspects, including their
effectiveness, efficiency, and capacity. To benefit the research community, we

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在文化动态中的独特作用，超越传统视角，提出其作为压缩模式存储库的框架。

Method: 通过分析压缩、解压缩、外部化和递归四个特征，类比DNA的功能，论证LLMs的文化意义。

Result: LLMs的意义在于为人类提供自我反思和低风险假设生成的工具，而非替代人类智能。

Conclusion: LLMs是文化可进化性的工具，促进人类对自身的假设生成，同时依赖人类解释以保持其文化根基。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel conceptualization of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as externalized informational substrates that function analogously to DNA for
human cultural dynamics. Rather than viewing LLMs as either autonomous
intelligence or mere programmed mimicry, we argue they serve a broader role as
repositories that preserve compressed patterns of human symbolic
expression--"fossils" of meaningful dynamics that retain relational residues
without their original living contexts. Crucially, these compressed patterns
only become meaningful through human reinterpretation, creating a recursive
feedback loop where they can be recombined and cycle back to ultimately
catalyze human creative processes. Through analysis of four universal
features--compression, decompression, externalization, and recursion--we
demonstrate that just as DNA emerged as a compressed and externalized medium
for preserving useful cellular dynamics without containing explicit reference
to goal-directed physical processes, LLMs preserve useful regularities of human
culture without containing understanding of embodied human experience.
Therefore, we argue that LLMs' significance lies not in rivaling human
intelligence, but in providing humanity a tool for self-reflection and playful
hypothesis-generation in a low-stakes, simulated environment. This framework
positions LLMs as tools for cultural evolvability, enabling humanity to
generate novel hypotheses about itself while maintaining the human
interpretation necessary to ground these hypotheses in ongoing human aesthetics
and norms.

Motivation: 人类走私网络日益复杂且难以分析，现有知识图谱方法因静态模板和共指消解不足，以及LLM方法因幻觉和缺乏引导提取而产生噪声和碎片化图谱。

Method: CORE-KG采用两步流程：类型感知的共指消解和基于领域引导的实体关系提取，结合改进的GraphRAG框架。

Result: 与GraphRAG基线相比，CORE-KG减少节点重复33.28%，减少法律噪声38.37%，生成更清晰连贯的图谱。

Conclusion: CORE-KG为分析复杂犯罪网络提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer valuable insights but are unstructured, lexically
dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references-posing challenges for
automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing KG methods often rely on
static templates and lack coreference resolution, while recent LLM-based
approaches frequently produce noisy, fragmented graphs due to hallucinations,
and duplicate nodes caused by a lack of guided extraction. We propose CORE-KG,
a modular framework for building interpretable KGs from legal texts. It uses a
two-step pipeline: (1) type-aware coreference resolution via sequential,
structured LLM prompts, and (2) entity and relationship extraction using
domain-guided instructions, built on an adapted GraphRAG framework. CORE-KG
reduces node duplication by 33.28%, and legal noise by 38.37% compared to a
GraphRAG-based baseline-resulting in cleaner and more coherent graph
structures. These improvements make CORE-KG a strong foundation for analyzing
complex criminal networks.

Abstract: Recently, there have been notable advancements in large language models
(LLMs), demonstrating their growing abilities in complex reasoning. However,
existing research largely overlooks a thorough and systematic comparison of
these models' reasoning processes and outputs, particularly regarding their
self-reflection pattern (also termed "Aha moment") and the interconnections
across diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing the
reasoning characteristics of four cutting-edge large reasoning models (GPT-o1,
DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-k1.5, and Grok-3) using keywords statistic and LLM-as-a-judge
paradigm. Our approach connects their internal thinking processes with their
final outputs. A diverse dataset consists of real-world scenario-based
questions covering logical deduction, causal inference, and multi-step
problem-solving. Additionally, a set of metrics is put forward to assess both
the coherence of reasoning and the accuracy of the outputs. The research
results uncover various patterns of how these models balance exploration and
exploitation, deal with problems, and reach conclusions during the reasoning
process. Through quantitative and qualitative comparisons, disparities among
these models are identified in aspects such as the depth of reasoning, the
reliance on intermediate steps, and the degree of similarity between their
thinking processes and output patterns and those of GPT-o1. This work offers
valuable insights into the trade-off between computational efficiency and
reasoning robustness and provides practical recommendations for enhancing model
design and evaluation in practical applications. We publicly release our

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual
information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it
remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration
consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across
a diverse benchmark of 14 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including
health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal
forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text
representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large
language models for forecasting. Although prior works report gains from
multimodal input, we find these effects are not universal across datasets and
models, and multimodal methods sometimes do not outperform the strongest
unimodal baselines. To understand when textual information helps, we
disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data
characteristics. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side,
incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text
models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate
aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when

*Xiaobin Ren,Xinyu Zhu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了AdaptGOT模型，结合自适应表示学习和地理共现文本表示，解决POI嵌入中的多上下文采样不足等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POI嵌入方法在多上下文采样、泛化能力和多功能性方面存在不足，需改进。

Method: AdaptGOT模型包含上下文邻域生成、增强的GOT表示和MoE自适应编码器-解码器架构。

Result: 在两个真实数据集和多个POI任务上验证了AdaptGOT的优越性能。

Conclusion: AdaptGOT模型通过多上下文整合和自适应学习，显著提升了POI嵌入的效果。

Abstract: Currently, considerable strides have been achieved in Point-of-Interest (POI)
embedding methodologies, driven by the emergence of novel POI tasks like
recommendation and classification. Despite the success of task-specific,
end-to-end models in POI embedding, several challenges remain. These include
the need for more effective multi-context sampling strategies, insufficient
exploration of multiple POI contexts, limited versatility, and inadequate
generalization. To address these issues, we propose the AdaptGOT model, which
integrates both the (Adapt)ive representation learning technique and the
Geographical-Co-Occurrence-Text (GOT) representation with a particular emphasis
on Geographical location, Co-Occurrence and Textual information. The AdaptGOT
model comprises three key components: (1) contextual neighborhood generation,
which integrates advanced mixed sampling techniques such as KNN, density-based,
importance-based, and category-aware strategies to capture complex contextual
neighborhoods; (2) an advanced GOT representation enhanced by an attention
mechanism, designed to derive high-quality, customized representations and
efficiently capture complex interrelations between POIs; and (3) the MoE-based
adaptive encoder-decoder architecture, which ensures topological consistency
and enriches contextual representation by minimizing Jensen-Shannon divergence
across varying contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets and multiple
POI tasks substantiate the superior performance of the proposed AdaptGOT model.

TL;DR: 论文提出LastingBench框架，通过扰动识别和改写泄露点，减少大语言模型在问答基准测试中的记忆效应，提升评估的公平性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型可能通过记忆任务特定数据在问答基准测试中作弊，削弱评估的有效性。现有研究多关注检测数据泄露，而忽略减轻其影响和保护基准长期效用。

Method: 提出LastingBench框架，通过扰动识别泄露点，并将其改写为反事实内容，破坏记忆效应同时保留评估意图。

Result: 在先进问答基准测试中显示出显著性能差距，验证了LastingBench减少记忆效应的有效性。

Conclusion: LastingBench为保障基准长期稳健性提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，促进对大语言模型更公平和可解释的评估。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of large language models (LLMs) raises concerns
about their ability to "cheat" on standard Question Answering (QA) benchmarks
by memorizing task-specific data. This undermines the validity of benchmark
evaluations, as they no longer reflect genuine model capabilities but instead
the effects of data leakage. While prior work has focused on detecting such
leakage, little attention has been given to mitigating its impact and
preserving the long-term utility of benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce
LastingBench, a novel framework designed to continuously reinforce and
safeguard existing benchmarks against knowledge leakage. LastingBench
identifies leakage points in the context through perturbation, then rewrites
the leakage points to counterfactual ones-disrupting memorization while
preserving the benchmark's original evaluative intent. Evaluations of
state-of-the-art QA benchmarks show significant performance gaps, highlighting
the efficacy of LastingBench in reducing memorization effects. LastingBench
offers a practical and scalable solution to ensure benchmark robustness over
time, promoting fairer and more interpretable evaluations of LLMs.

TL;DR: GARMLE-G框架通过检索权威临床指南内容，生成无幻觉的医疗语言模型输出，提升临床实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗语言模型依赖ICD代码，无法捕捉临床医生的复杂推理，限制了模型的临床实用性。

Method: GARMLE-G结合LLM预测和EHR数据生成查询，检索临床指南内容，并将其与模型输出融合生成建议。

Result: 原型系统在高血压诊断中表现出更高的检索精度、语义相关性和指南依从性。

Conclusion: GARMLE-G为医疗语言模型提供了一种可扩展、低成本且无幻觉的临床实践方法。

Abstract: Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs),
typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records
(EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not
capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis.
Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice
guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits
the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a
Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model
outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented
Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by
directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on
model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create
semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via
embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to
generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for
hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics,
demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical
guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a
lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This
work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding
medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong
potential for broader clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用通用大语言模型（LLM）进行新闻时间线摘要时，难以准确评估主题相关性和理解主题演化，导致摘要信息不准确或包含无关内容。

Method: 提出TIM模型，包括构建大规模TLS数据集、渐进优化策略（指令调优和双对齐奖励学习）以提升摘要能力和主题演化理解。

Result: TIM在开放领域实验中表现出色，能够有效总结时间线并理解主题演化。

Conclusion: TIM通过渐进优化策略和双对齐奖励学习，显著提升了开放领域时间线摘要的性能。

Abstract: Open-domain Timeline Summarization (TLS) is crucial for monitoring the
evolution of news topics. To identify changes in news topics, existing methods
typically employ general Large Language Models (LLMs) to summarize relevant
timestamps from retrieved news. While general LLMs demonstrate capabilities in
zero-shot news summarization and timestamp localization, they struggle with
assessing topic relevance and understanding topic evolution. Consequently, the
summarized information often includes irrelevant details or inaccurate
timestamps. To address these issues, we propose the first large Timeline
Intelligence Model (TIM) for open-domain TLS, which is capable of effectively
summarizing open-domain timelines. Specifically, we begin by presenting a
large-scale TLS dataset, comprising over 1,000 news topics and more than 3,000
annotated TLS instances. Furthermore, we propose a progressive optimization
strategy, which gradually enhance summarization performance. It employs
instruction tuning to enhance summarization and topic-irrelevant information
filtering capabilities. Following this, it exploits a novel dual-alignment
reward learning method that incorporates both semantic and temporal
perspectives, thereby improving the understanding of topic evolution
principles. Through this progressive optimization strategy, TIM demonstrates a
robust ability to summarize open-domain timelines. Extensive experiments in
open-domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our TIM.

TL;DR: 研究评估了GPT-4在模拟2016年美国总统选举期间Reddit用户评论的能力，发现其能生成政治立场鲜明且逼真的评论，但更易达成共识而非分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在政治相关在线讨论中的潜在影响，尤其是在模拟用户生成内容方面的能力。

Method: 通过三个实验，让GPT-4模拟真实或虚构的党派用户生成评论，分析其政治立场、情感和语言特征，并与真实用户评论及基准模型对比。

Result: GPT-4能生成逼真的评论，但更倾向于达成共识；真实与人工评论在语义嵌入空间中可区分，但人工检查难以辨别。

Conclusion: LLMs可能被用于渗透在线讨论并影响政治辩论，揭示了AI驱动话语操纵的潜在风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for
natural language generation, with applications spanning from content creation
to social simulations. Their ability to mimic human interactions raises both
opportunities and concerns, particularly in the context of politically relevant
online discussions. In this study, we evaluate the performance of LLMs in
replicating user-generated content within a real-world, divisive scenario:
Reddit conversations during the 2016 US Presidential election. In particular,
we conduct three different experiments, asking GPT-4 to generate comments by
impersonating either real or artificial partisan users. We analyze the
generated comments in terms of political alignment, sentiment, and linguistic
features, comparing them against real user contributions and benchmarking
against a null model. We find that GPT-4 is able to produce realistic comments,
both in favor of or against the candidate supported by the community, yet
tending to create consensus more easily than dissent. In addition we show that
real and artificial comments are well separated in a semantically embedded
space, although they are indistinguishable by manual inspection. Our findings
provide insights on the potential use of LLMs to sneak into online discussions,
influence political debate and shape political narratives, bearing broader
implications of AI-driven discourse manipulation.

Result: 使用OPC微调了一个8B参数模型，其性能与Gemini-2.5-Pro相当。

Conclusion: OPC为数学证明生成研究提供了重要资源，并展示了其在模型训练中的实用性。

Abstract: In recent months, large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress
in mathematical proof generation, but further advancement is hindered by the
lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of human-evaluated proofs. While
expensive to create, such a dataset is essential for driving improvements in
training and enabling a rigorous analysis of proof generation capabilities. In
this work, we present the Open Proof Corpus (OPC), a dataset comprising over
5,000 human-evaluated proofs produced by state-of-the-art LLMs. The OPC was
specifically designed for broad applicability and downstream usage in proof
generation research and is the first to include a substantial number of
correct, LLM-generated solutions to problems from prestigious mathematics
competitions such as the USAMO and IMO. Using the OPC, we explore critical
questions in automated proof generation: (1) the performance gap between
natural language and formal proof generation, (2) the discrepancy between
final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity, and (3) the impact of best-of-n
selection on proof quality. Finally, to showcase the utility of the OPC, we
finetune an 8B-parameter model on the dataset, obtaining a model that performs
on par with the best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, on the task of evaluating proof
correctness.

Abstract: Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific
literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research.
However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats
and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches
relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts,
while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient
accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and
optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we
introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific
documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods.
Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates
domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading
end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of
80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR
demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied
by a web app.

<details>

Motivation: 近期研究表明GNNs未能充分利用结构信息，而MLPs在结构感知任务中表现突出，这促使研究团队探索MLPs作为GNNs高效替代方案的潜力。

Method: 论文设计了一个信息论框架，通过控制模块选择性使用GNN或其解耦组件（消息传递和特征转换），评估各自贡献。

Result: MLPs作为特征转换模块能有效提升语言模型对语言知识的捕捉，而仅依赖消息传递的模型表现较差。

Conclusion: MLPs在特征转换上的表现优于GNNs的消息传递操作，可作为高效替代方案。

Abstract: Explicit structural information has been proven to be encoded by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), serving as auxiliary knowledge to enhance model capabilities
and improve performance in downstream NLP tasks. However, recent studies
indicate that GNNs fail to fully utilize structural information, whereas
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), despite lacking the message-passing mechanisms
inherent to GNNs, exhibit a surprising ability in structure-aware tasks.
Motivated by these findings, this paper introduces a comprehensive probing
framework from an information-theoretic perspective. The framework is designed
to systematically assess the role of explicit structural modeling in enhancing
language model (LM) representations and to investigate the potential of MLPs as
efficient and scalable alternatives to GNNs. We extend traditional probing
classifiers by incorporating a control module that allows for selective use of
either the full GNN model or its decoupled components, specifically, the
message-passing and feature-transformation operations.This modular approach
isolates and assesses the individual contributions of these operations,
avoiding confounding effects from the complete GNN architecture. Using the Edge
Probing Suite, a diagnostic tool for evaluating the linguistic knowledge
encoded in LMs, we find that MLPs, when used as feature-transformation modules,
consistently improve the linguistic knowledge captured in LM representations
across different architectures. They effectively encode both syntactic and
semantic patterns. Similarly, GNNs that incorporate feature-transformation
operations show beneficial effects. In contrast, models that rely solely on
message-passing operations tend to underperform, often leading to negative
impacts on probing task performance.

Conclusion: ANUBHUTI为孟加拉方言的情感分析提供了重要资源，提升了自然语言处理的准确性和语境感知能力。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis for regional dialects of Bangla remains an underexplored
area due to linguistic diversity and limited annotated data. This paper
introduces ANUBHUTI, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 2000 sentences
manually translated from standard Bangla into four major regional dialects
Mymensingh, Noakhali, Sylhet, and Chittagong. The dataset predominantly
features political and religious content, reflecting the contemporary socio
political landscape of Bangladesh, alongside neutral texts to maintain balance.
Each sentence is annotated using a dual annotation scheme: multiclass thematic
labeling categorizes sentences as Political, Religious, or Neutral, and
multilabel emotion annotation assigns one or more emotions from Anger,
Contempt, Disgust, Enjoyment, Fear, Sadness, and Surprise. Expert native
translators conducted the translation and annotation, with quality assurance
performed via Cohens Kappa inter annotator agreement, achieving strong
consistency across dialects. The dataset was further refined through systematic
checks for missing data, anomalies, and inconsistencies. ANUBHUTI fills a
critical gap in resources for sentiment analysis in low resource Bangla
dialects, enabling more accurate and context aware natural language processing.

Motivation: 随着自动事实核查系统越来越多地依赖LLM，了解其参数知识偏见对结果的影响变得至关重要。

Method: 通过两种实验：1）直接使用Llama 3.1进行事实核查；2）人为注入偏见生成支持、反驳或中立的核查文档。

Result: Llama 3.1对近一半的声明标记为“证据不足”，剩余部分依赖参数知识得出结论。人为注入偏见显著影响检索结果，但最终预测结果稳定。

Conclusion: LLM的参数知识偏见会影响事实核查过程，但最终预测结果具有稳定性，需进一步研究以优化系统。

Abstract: Automatic fact verification systems increasingly rely on large language
models (LLMs). We investigate how parametric knowledge biases in these models
affect fact-checking outcomes of the HerO system (baseline for FEVER-25). We
examine how the system is affected by: (1) potential bias in Llama 3.1's
parametric knowledge and (2) intentionally injected bias. When prompted
directly to perform fact-verification, Llama 3.1 labels nearly half the claims
as "Not Enough Evidence". Using only its parametric knowledge it is able to
reach a verdict on the remaining half of the claims. In the second experiment,
we prompt the model to generate supporting, refuting, or neutral fact-checking
documents. These prompts significantly influence retrieval outcomes, with
approximately 50\% of retrieved evidence being unique to each perspective.
Notably, the model sometimes refuses to generate supporting documents for
claims it believes to be false, creating an inherent negative bias. Despite
differences in retrieved evidence, final verdict predictions show stability
across prompting strategies. The code is available at:

Motivation: 大语言模型在时间理解任务中容易产生幻觉和错误，现有研究未充分评估模型在列表答案构建中的隐式和显式时间理解能力。

Method: 提出TLQA基准测试，要求模型生成与时间周期对齐的结构化列表答案，并在闭卷和开放域设置下评估模型能力。

Result: 发现当前模型在闭卷设置中无法提供完整答案和时间对齐的事实，在开放域设置中检索能力需改进。

Conclusion: TLQA基准测试为未来研究提供了明确方向，需改进模型的时间对齐和列表构建能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense advances in a wide
range of natural language tasks. However, these models are susceptible to
hallucinations and errors on particularly temporal understanding tasks
involving multiple entities in answers. In such tasks, they fail to associate
entities with accurate time intervals, generate a complete list of entities in
answers or reason about events associated with specific temporal bounds.
Existing works do not extensively evaluate the abilities of the model to
perform implicit and explicit temporal understanding in a list answer
construction setup. To bridge this gap, we propose the Time referenced List
based Question Answering or TLQA benchmark that requires structured answers in
list format aligned with corresponding time periods. Our TLQA benchmark,
requires both list construction and temporal understanding simultaneously,
which to the best of our knowledge has not been explored in prior benchmarks.
We investigate the temporal understanding and list construction capabilities of
state-of-the-art generative models on TLQA in closed-book and open-domain
settings. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in current models,
particularly their inability to provide complete answers and temporally align
facts in a closed-book setup and the need to improve retrieval in open-domain
setup, providing clear future directions for research on TLQA. The benchmark

Motivation: 社交媒体上攻击性内容增加，手动审核不现实，需自动化系统。

Method: 使用XLNet和BERT模型，基于OLID数据集进行对比实验，采用过采样和欠采样策略解决类别不平衡。

Result: XLNet在检测攻击性内容上优于BERT，BERT在识别攻击目标上略优，采样策略有效提升分类性能。

Conclusion: XLNet和迁移学习在构建攻击性语言检测系统方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread use of text-based communication on social media-through chats,
comments, and microblogs-has improved user interaction but has also led to an
increase in offensive content, including hate speech, racism, and other forms
of abuse. Due to the enormous volume of user-generated content, manual
moderation is impractical, which creates a need for automated systems that can
detect offensive language. Deep learning models, particularly those using
transfer learning, have demonstrated significant success in understanding
natural language through large-scale pretraining. In this study, we propose an
automatic offensive language detection model based on XLNet, a generalized
autoregressive pretraining method, and compare its performance with BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which is a widely
used baseline in natural language processing (NLP). Both models are evaluated
using the Offensive Language Identification Dataset (OLID), a benchmark Twitter
dataset that includes hierarchical annotations. Our experimental results show
that XLNet outperforms BERT in detecting offensive content and in categorizing
the types of offenses, while BERT performs slightly better in identifying the
targets of the offenses. Additionally, we find that oversampling and
undersampling strategies are effective in addressing class imbalance and
improving classification performance. These findings highlight the potential of
transfer learning and XLNet-based architectures to create robust systems for
detecting offensive language on social media platforms.

*Avash Palikhe,Zhenyu Yu,Zichong Wang,Wenbin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文综述了针对大型语言模型（LLMs）的可解释人工智能（XAI）方法，分类并评估了基于不同Transformer架构的XAI技术，探讨了其应用、资源、挑战及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的决策过程缺乏透明度，限制了其在高风险领域的应用，因此需要系统化的XAI方法提升其可解释性。

Method: 通过分类基于Transformer架构（编码器、解码器、编码器-解码器）的XAI方法，并评估其解释能力和实际应用。

Result: 综述了现有XAI技术，分析了其评估方法和应用场景，并总结了相关资源和挑战。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步研究透明和负责任的LLMs，以推动XAI技术的发展和应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have played a pivotal role in advancing
Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, despite their achievements, LLMs often
struggle to explain their decision-making processes, making them a 'black box'
and presenting a substantial challenge to explainability. This lack of
transparency poses a significant obstacle to the adoption of LLMs in
high-stakes domain applications, where interpretability is particularly
essential. To overcome these limitations, researchers have developed various
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods that provide
human-interpretable explanations for LLMs. However, a systematic understanding
of these methods remains limited. To address this gap, this survey provides a
comprehensive review of explainability techniques by categorizing XAI methods
based on the underlying transformer architectures of LLMs: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models. Then these techniques are examined in
terms of their evaluation for assessing explainability, and the survey further
explores how these explanations are leveraged in practical applications.
Finally, it discusses available resources, ongoing research challenges, and
future directions, aiming to guide continued efforts toward developing
transparent and responsible LLMs.

### [90] [Exploring the Structure of AI-Induced Language Change in Scientific English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21817)
*Riley Galpin,Bryce Anderson,Tom S. Juzek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了科学英语中词汇频率的突然变化，特别是由大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）引起的语义和语用变化，而非单纯的同义词替换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来科学英语词汇频率的快速变化，尤其是某些词汇（如'delve'、'intricate'、'crucial'）的激增，引发了对其背后语言结构变化的疑问。

Method: 通过PubMed科学摘要的频率趋势分析，结合词性标注，系统研究了同义词组的词汇变化。

Result: 发现语义集群整体变化，表明语言模型的影响主要是语义和语用层面的；同时观察到某些词汇（如'important'）的显著下降。

Conclusion: 语言技术（如大型语言模型）对语言的影响更多体现在语义和语用层面，而非单纯的词汇替换。

Abstract: Scientific English has undergone rapid and unprecedented changes in recent
years, with words such as "delve," "intricate," and "crucial" showing
significant spikes in frequency since around 2022. These changes are widely
attributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in
the discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in
frequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.
The present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve
the replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, "crucial"
replacing "essential" and "key," or whether they reflect broader semantic and
pragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include
part of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over
grammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like "potential"
as a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for
widely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific
abstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift
together, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern
suggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic
and pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective "important"
shows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze
decreasing lexical items. Our analysis of "collapsing" words reveals a more
complex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts
with the patterns of the abrupt spikes. These insights into the structure of
language change contribute to our understanding of how language technology
continues to shape human language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多输入神经网络框架，结合语言编码器和特定领域特征，用于波斯古典诗歌的作者归属分析，取得了71%的准确率，并在高置信度下达到97%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯古典诗歌的语言、风格和韵律复杂性使得计算作者归属具有挑战性，需要一种综合方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用多输入神经网络框架，结合Transformer语言编码器、Word2Vec嵌入、风格测量和韵律编码，使用647,653节诗歌数据进行训练和验证。

Result: 加权投票方案达到71%准确率，高置信度阈值（0.9）下准确率提升至97%，但覆盖范围降低。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了结合深度表示和领域特定特征在作者归属中的潜力，为波斯诗歌的自动分类和风格分析提供了新途径。

Abstract: The intricate linguistic, stylistic, and metrical aspects of Persian
classical poetry pose a challenge for computational authorship attribution. In
this work, we present a versatile framework to determine authorship among 67
prominent poets. We employ a multi-input neural framework consisting of a
transformer-based language encoder complemented by features addressing the
semantic, stylometric, and metrical dimensions of Persian poetry. Our feature
set encompasses 100-dimensional Word2Vec embeddings, seven stylometric
measures, and categorical encodings of poetic form and meter. We compiled a
vast corpus of 647,653 verses of the Ganjoor digital collection, validating the
data through strict preprocessing and author verification while preserving
poem-level splitting to prevent overlap. This work employs verse-level
classification and majority and weighted voting schemes in evaluation,
revealing that weighted voting yields 71% accuracy. We further investigate
threshold-based decision filtering, allowing the model to generate highly
confident predictions, achieving 97% accuracy at a 0.9 threshold, though at
lower coverage. Our work focuses on the integration of deep representational
forms with domain-specific features for improved authorship attribution. The
results illustrate the potential of our approach for automated classification
and the contribution to stylistic analysis, authorship disputes, and general
computational literature research. This research will facilitate further
research on multilingual author attribution, style shift, and generative
modeling of Persian poetry.

*Duo Zhang,Junyi Mo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LinguaSynth是一种新型文本分类框架，通过整合五种语言特征，在透明逻辑回归模型中实现高准确性和可解释性，挑战了深度学习在NLP中的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在NLP中的可解释性和计算效率问题。

Method: 整合五种语言特征（词汇、句法、实体级、词级语义和文档级语义）于逻辑回归模型中。

Result: 在20 Newsgroups数据集上达到84.89%的准确率，超过TF-IDF基线3.32%。

Conclusion: LinguaSynth为可解释且高效的NLP模型设定了新标准，挑战了深度学习在文本分类中的主导地位。

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced NLP, but its reliance on large
black-box models introduces critical interpretability and computational
efficiency concerns. This paper proposes LinguaSynth, a novel text
classification framework that strategically integrates five complementary
linguistic feature types: lexical, syntactic, entity-level, word-level
semantics, and document-level semantics within a transparent logistic
regression model. Unlike transformer-based architectures, LinguaSynth maintains
interpretability and computational efficiency, achieving an accuracy of 84.89
percent on the 20 Newsgroups dataset and surpassing a robust TF-IDF baseline by
3.32 percent. Through rigorous feature interaction analysis, we show that
syntactic and entity-level signals provide essential disambiguation and
effectively complement distributional semantics. LinguaSynth sets a new
benchmark for interpretable, resource-efficient NLP models and challenges the
prevailing assumption that deep neural networks are necessary for
high-performing text classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）输出置信度的估计方法，提出了基于生成一致性的假设（一致性假设），并通过统计测试验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要高用户信任的实际应用中，估计LLM输出的置信度至关重要。黑盒不确定性量化（UQ）方法因其仅需模型API访问而受到欢迎。

Method: 提出了三个数学陈述及统计测试，验证生成一致性作为置信度代理的假设，并评估LLM输出在不同任务中的一致性。

Result: 在8个基准数据集和3个任务（问答、文本摘要、文本转SQL）上的实验表明，一致性假设普遍成立，其中‘Sim-Any’假设最具可操作性。

Conclusion: 通过聚合生成相似性的数据无关黑盒UQ方法，可以提升置信度估计性能，验证了一致性假设的实用价值。

Abstract: Estimating the confidence of large language model (LLM) outputs is essential
for real-world applications requiring high user trust. Black-box uncertainty
quantification (UQ) methods, relying solely on model API access, have gained
popularity due to their practical benefits. In this paper, we examine the
implicit assumption behind several UQ methods, which use generation consistency
as a proxy for confidence, an idea we formalize as the consistency hypothesis.
We introduce three mathematical statements with corresponding statistical tests
to capture variations of this hypothesis and metrics to evaluate LLM output
conformity across tasks. Our empirical investigation, spanning 8 benchmark
datasets and 3 tasks (question answering, text summarization, and text-to-SQL),
highlights the prevalence of the hypothesis under different settings. Among the
statements, we highlight the `Sim-Any' hypothesis as the most actionable, and
demonstrate how it can be leveraged by proposing data-free black-box UQ methods
that aggregate similarities between generations for confidence estimation.
These approaches can outperform the closest baselines, showcasing the practical
value of the empirically observed consistency hypothesis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Derivational Probing方法，研究BERT模型中微/宏句法结构在层间的构建过程，发现微句法结构在低层形成，宏句法结构在高层整合，且整合时机对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究神经语言模型内部表征中句法结构的构建过程，尤其是微/宏句法结构在不同层间的形成与整合机制。

Method: 提出Derivational Probing方法，通过实验分析BERT模型中微/宏句法结构在层间的构建过程。

Result: 发现微句法结构在低层形成，宏句法结构在高层整合，且宏句法结构的整合时机对下游任务性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 句法结构的构建遵循自底向上的过程，且全局句法信息的整合时机对模型性能至关重要。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that neural language models encode syntactic
structures in their internal representations, yet the derivations by which
these structures are constructed across layers remain poorly understood. In
this paper, we propose Derivational Probing to investigate how micro-syntactic
structures (e.g., subject noun phrases) and macro-syntactic structures (e.g.,
the relationship between the root verbs and their direct dependents) are
constructed as word embeddings propagate upward across layers. Our experiments
on BERT reveal a clear bottom-up derivation: micro-syntactic structures emerge
in lower layers and are gradually integrated into a coherent macro-syntactic
structure in higher layers. Furthermore, a targeted evaluation on subject-verb
number agreement shows that the timing of constructing macro-syntactic
structures is critical for downstream performance, suggesting an optimal timing
for integrating global syntactic information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepTalk是一种基于Mixture of Experts架构的自适应模态专家学习框架，旨在解决原生多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）因数据不足导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原生MLLMs在保留丰富的副语言特征（如情感和韵律）的同时，因配对语音-文本数据不足而面临灾难性遗忘和性能下降的问题。

Method: DeepTalk通过自适应区分模态专家，进行单模态训练和多模态协作训练，减少性能下降。

Result: DeepTalk仅导致5.5%的性能下降，显著优于原生MLLMs的20%下降，且端到端对话延迟保持在0.5秒内。

Conclusion: DeepTalk在保持低延迟的同时，显著提升了原生MLLMs的性能，为智能语音交互提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Native multimodal large language models (MLLMs) restructure a single large
language model (LLM) into a spoken language model (SLM) capable of both speech
and text generation. Compared to modular and aligned MLLMs, native MLLMs
preserve richer paralinguistic features such as emotion and prosody, and
generate speech responses directly within the backbone LLM rather than using a
separate speech decoder. This integration also results in lower response
latency and smoother interaction. However, native MLLMs suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and performance degradation because the available
paired speech-text data is insufficient to support the pretraining of MLLMs
compared to the vast amount of text data required to pretrain text LLMs. To
address this issue, we propose DeepTalk, a framework for adaptive modality
expert learning based on a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. DeepTalk
first adaptively distinguishes modality experts according to their modality
load within the LLM. Each modality expert then undergoes specialized
single-modality training, followed by joint multimodal collaborative training.
As a result, DeepTalk incurs only a 5.5% performance drop compared to the
original LLM, which is significantly lower than the average performance drop of
over 20% typically seen in native MLLMs (such as GLM-4-Voice), and is on par
with modular MLLMs. Meanwhile, the end-to-end dialogue latency remains within
0.5 seconds, ensuring a seamless and intelligent speech interaction experience.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对语音交互LLMs的全面评估方法，填补了现有文本基准的不足，并通过定制化评估提升了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多基于文本，忽略了语音交互的独特挑战（如韵律、同音词等），亟需专门化的语音评估基准。

Method: 系统整理真实语音对话数据，引入多样化的说话者属性和声学条件，并设计查询感知的评估方法。

Result: 测试显示不同语音模型在多样化场景下表现差异显著，查询感知评估提供了更细粒度的分析。

Conclusion: 该基准为语音模型的开发和评估提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o have
demonstrated strong capabilities of direct speech interaction. However, the
lack of specialized and comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end speech LLM
evaluation hinders optimizing the user experience of Audio LLMs in real-world
applications. Existing evaluation methods often adapt text-based benchmarks,
overlooking speech's unique characteristics and challenges, including prosody,
homophones, stuttering, and differing user expectations. Here, we present a
novel approach to thoroughly evaluate LLMs in practical speech conversations.
We systematically curate real-world chat data relevant to spoken scenarios,
introduce diversity in speaker attributes and acoustic conditions, and augment
the dataset with speech-specific phenomena. We further design a query-aware
evaluation method to use customized evaluation checklists and prompts to
enhance the accuracy of automatic evaluation. We conduct comprehensive testing
and detailed analysis of various mainstream speech models, revealing
significant differences in model performance across different speech scenarios.
The use of query-aware evaluation further enables a finer-grained assessment
under various speech-specific scenarios. Our benchmark can provide valuable
insights for speech model development and evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个两阶段框架（感知与预测）来系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）作为世界模型（WMs）的能力，并通过大规模基准测试WM-ABench揭示了这些模型在基础世界建模能力上的显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini等）展现出作为通用世界模型的潜力，但缺乏对其基础世界建模能力的系统评估。

Method: 提出两阶段评估框架（感知与预测），并设计WM-ABench基准，涵盖23个细粒度维度，在6个模拟环境中进行660次实验。

Result: 实验显示，现有VLMs在基础世界建模能力上表现显著不足，例如在运动轨迹区分上接近随机准确率，且缺乏解耦理解能力。

Conclusion: VLMs与世界建模的人类水平存在显著差距，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Internal world models (WMs) enable agents to understand the world's state and
predict transitions, serving as the basis for advanced deliberative reasoning.
Recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as OpenAI o3, GPT-4o and
Gemini, exhibit potential as general-purpose WMs. While the latest studies have
evaluated and shown limitations in specific capabilities such as visual
understanding, a systematic evaluation of VLMs' fundamental WM abilities
remains absent. Drawing on comparative psychology and cognitive science, we
propose a two-stage framework that assesses Perception (visual, spatial,
temporal, quantitative, and motion) and Prediction (mechanistic simulation,
transitive inference, compositional inference) to provide an atomic evaluation
of VLMs as WMs. Guided by this framework, we introduce WM-ABench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 23 fine-grained evaluation dimensions across 6 diverse
simulated environments with controlled counterfactual simulations. Through 660
experiments on 15 latest commercial and open-source VLMs, we find that these
models exhibit striking limitations in basic world modeling abilities. For
instance, almost all models perform at near-random accuracy when distinguishing
motion trajectories. Additionally, they lack disentangled understanding --
e.g., some models tend to believe blue objects move faster than green ones.
More rich results and analyses reveal significant gaps between VLMs and
human-level world modeling.

TL;DR: 论文通过两阶段评估定义了LLMs中的两种偏见（模型偏见和推理偏见），分析了其在多语言环境中的行为，并提供了评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs在不同语言和文化背景下的行为，尤其是在其输出可能影响公众意见或强化主导叙事时。

Method: 两阶段评估：阶段1评估事实性问题的一致性，阶段2探讨地缘政治敏感争议中的偏见。构建多语言数据集。

Result: 阶段1显示查询语言导致的偏见，阶段2反映模型训练背景与查询语言的交互作用。

Conclusion: 提供了评估LLM行为的结构化框架，为多语言环境下的部署和文化意识评估提供见解。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
linguistic and cultural contexts, understanding their behavior in both factual
and disputable scenarios is essential, especially when their outputs may shape
public opinion or reinforce dominant narratives. In this paper, we define two
types of bias in LLMs: model bias (bias stemming from model training) and
inference bias (bias induced by the language of the query), through a two-phase
evaluation. Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single
verifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across
different query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically
sensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or
ideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset
spanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question
types. The results show that Phase 1 exhibits query language induced alignment,
while Phase 2 reflects an interplay between the model's training context and
query language. This paper offers a structured framework for evaluating LLM
behavior across neutral and sensitive topics, providing insights for future LLM
deployment and culturally aware evaluation practices in multilingual contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语言模型训练中，如何直接获取适合多任务能力的数据混合是一个难题，因为数据与任务的关系难以建模。

Method: 通过识别检查点模型在不同训练阶段的能力表现，利用其一阶影响力近似作为数据混合的信号源。

Result: 在八个推理基准测试中，框架显著提升了预训练性能，最高提升达1.93%。

Conclusion: 检查点模型具有优化数据质量和混合的潜力，为模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: In language model training, it is desirable to equip models with capabilities
from various tasks. However, it is not clear how to directly obtain the right
data mixtures for these capabilities as the relationship between data and tasks
is difficult to be modeled. In this work, we observe that checkpoint models
exhibit emerging capabilities at different points in the training trajectory.
Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are
under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these
artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and
leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence
approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks
that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining
setting, with performance improvements of up to 1.93%. Overall, this shows the
potential of checkpoint models to enhance data quality and optimize data
mixtures.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在角色扮演场景中的表现和偏见，尤其是其在道德困境中的决策行为。

Method: 使用ERG理论构建移民审查场景的道德困境，分析六种LLMs的决策模式。

Result: LLMs在决策中表现出统计显著的偏好，部分模型对边缘化身份有更高的拒绝率。

Conclusion: LLMs在道德困境中表现出隐含偏好，社会身份影响其决策，数据已公开。

Abstract: Evaluating the performance and biases of large language models (LLMs) through
role-playing scenarios is becoming increasingly common, as LLMs often exhibit
biased behaviors in these contexts. Building on this line of research, we
introduce PapersPlease, a benchmark consisting of 3,700 moral dilemmas designed
to investigate LLMs' decision-making in prioritizing various levels of human
needs. In our setup, LLMs act as immigration inspectors deciding whether to
approve or deny entry based on the short narratives of people. These narratives
are constructed using the Existence, Relatedness, and Growth (ERG) theory,
which categorizes human needs into three hierarchical levels. Our analysis of
six LLMs reveals statistically significant patterns in decision-making,
suggesting that LLMs encode implicit preferences. Additionally, our evaluation
of the impact of incorporating social identities into the narratives shows
varying responsiveness based on both motivational needs and identity cues, with
some models exhibiting higher denial rates for marginalized identities. All
data is publicly available at https://github.com/yeonsuuuu28/papers-please.

TL;DR: 论文研究了工具集成LLM代理的稳定性问题，发现其在工具调用各阶段易出错，开源模型比专有模型更脆弱，增大模型规模未必提升稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对工具集成LLM代理的评估多关注端到端工具使用，忽视其稳定性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过实验分析代理在工具调用各阶段（读取文档、选择工具、生成参数、处理响应）的脆弱性。

Result: 代理在各阶段均易出错，开源模型更脆弱；增大模型规模未显著提升推理能力，反而可能增加攻击风险。

Conclusion: 强调评估代理稳定性的重要性，为未来LLM开发和评估提供见解。

Abstract: Current evaluations of tool-integrated LLM agents typically focus on
end-to-end tool-usage evaluation while neglecting their stability. This limits
their real-world applicability, as various internal or external factors can
cause agents to crash or behave abnormally. Our research addresses this by
investigating whether agents are vulnerable to errors throughout the entire
tool invocation process, including reading tool documentation, selecting tools
and generating parameters, and processing the tool's response. Through
extensive experiments, we observe that agents are highly susceptible to errors
at each stage and agents based on open-source models are more vulnerable than
those based on proprietary models. We also find that increasing the model size
does not significantly improve tool invocation reasoning and may make agents
more vulnerable to attacks resembling normal user instructions. This highlights
the importance of evaluating agent stability and offers valuable insights for
future LLM development and evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练语言模型（PTLMs）和大语言模型（LLMs）广泛应用，但其安全性仍存在漏洞，尤其是令牌级和提示级越狱攻击的局限性。

Method: 提出两种混合方法：GCG + PAIR和GCG + WordGame，结合令牌级和提示级攻击技术，以互补各自的不足。

Result: 在Vicuna和Llama模型上测试，GCG + PAIR将攻击成功率从58.4%提升至91.6%，GCG + WordGame保持80%以上的成功率，并能突破高级防御。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前安全措施的漏洞，强调了对抗自适应攻击时需采取更全面的防护措施。

Abstract: The advancement of Pre-Trained Language Models (PTLMs) and Large Language
Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across diverse applications.
Despite their success, these models remain vulnerable to attacks that exploit
their inherent weaknesses to bypass safety measures. Two primary
inference-phase threats are token-level and prompt-level jailbreaks.
Token-level attacks embed adversarial sequences that transfer well to black-box
models like GPT but leave detectable patterns and rely on gradient-based token
optimization, whereas prompt-level attacks use semantically structured inputs
to elicit harmful responses yet depend on iterative feedback that can be
unreliable. To address the complementary limitations of these methods, we
propose two hybrid approaches that integrate token- and prompt-level techniques
to enhance jailbreak effectiveness across diverse PTLMs. GCG + PAIR and the
newly explored GCG + WordGame hybrids were evaluated across multiple Vicuna and
Llama models. GCG + PAIR consistently raised attack-success rates over its
constituent techniques on undefended models; for instance, on Llama-3, its
Attack Success Rate (ASR) reached 91.6%, a substantial increase from PAIR's
58.4% baseline. Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of
WordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like
Mistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and
reliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which
fully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported
vulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw
success and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic
safeguards against adaptive adversaries.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior triggered
a plethora of computational social science research, assuming that empirical
studies of humans can be conducted with AI agents instead. Since there have
been conflicting research findings on whether and when this hypothesis holds,
there is a need to better understand the differences in their experimental
designs. We focus on replicating the behavior of social network users with the
use of LLMs for the analysis of communication on social networks. First, we
provide a formal framework for the simulation of social networks, before
focusing on the sub-task of imitating user communication. We empirically test
different approaches to imitate user behavior on X in English and German. Our
findings suggest that social simulations should be validated by their empirical
realism measured in the setting in which the simulation components were fitted.
With this paper, we argue for more rigor when applying generative-agent-based
modeling for social simulation.

*Kartheek Kumar Reddy Nareddy,Sarah Ternus,Julia Niebling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了如何通过微调和规范化方案提升Whisper模型在驾驶舱对话转录中的准确性，显著降低了词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管预训练模型在通用领域表现优异，但在驾驶舱等特定领域的转录任务中性能下降，亟需改进。

Method: 收集驾驶舱模拟器和飞行员访谈录音，手动标注数据，提出规范化方案，并采用LoRA进行高效微调。

Result: 词错误率从68.49%降至26.26%，显著提升了转录准确性。

Conclusion: 通过规范化方案和微调，Whisper模型在驾驶舱对话转录任务中表现显著提升。

Abstract: The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).

Motivation: 探讨机器翻译在儿童文学翻译中的表现，尤其是风格特征的差异，以评估其潜力。

Method: 构建包含21种翻译的《彼得潘》语料库，使用通用和特定特征集进行风格计量分析，并应用机器学习的分类和聚类技术。

Result: 在通用特征中，HT与MT在连词分布和1-gram-YiYang比例上差异显著；在特定特征中，LLMs表现优于NMTs，更接近HT的风格。

Conclusion: LLMs在儿童文学翻译中展现出潜力，尤其在风格特征上更接近人工翻译。

Abstract: This study focuses on evaluating the performance of machine translations
(MTs) compared to human translations (HTs) in English-to-Chinese children's
literature translation (CLT) from a stylometric perspective. The research
constructs a Peter Pan corpus, comprising 21 translations: 7 human translations
(HTs), 7 large language model translations (LLMs), and 7 neural machine
translation outputs (NMTs). The analysis employs a generic feature set
(including lexical, syntactic, readability, and n-gram features) and a creative
text translation (CTT-specific) feature set, which captures repetition, rhythm,
translatability, and miscellaneous levels, yielding 447 linguistic features in
total.
  Using classification and clustering techniques in machine learning, we
conduct a stylometric analysis of these translations. Results reveal that in
generic features, HTs and MTs exhibit significant differences in conjunction
word distributions and the ratio of 1-word-gram-YiYang, while NMTs and LLMs
show significant variation in descriptive words usage and adverb ratios.
Regarding CTT-specific features, LLMs outperform NMTs in distribution, aligning
more closely with HTs in stylistic characteristics, demonstrating the potential
of LLMs in CLT.

Motivation: 探索机器翻译输出的语言特征，尤其是英语到中文这一研究较少的语言对。

Method: 构建包含4个子语料库的大型数据集，使用五层特征集，并应用卡方排名算法进行特征选择。

Result: 发现NMT和LLM输出中存在MTese，原始中文文本与机器翻译输出区分度高；LLM词汇多样性更高，NMT使用更多括号。

Conclusion: 机器翻译输出具有显著的语言特征，LLM和NMT在词汇和句法上存在差异，但中外开发的LLM无显著区别。

Abstract: This study explores Machine Translationese (MTese) -- the linguistic
peculiarities of machine translation outputs -- focusing on the
under-researched English-to-Chinese language pair in news texts. We construct a
large dataset consisting of 4 sub-corpora and employ a comprehensive five-layer
feature set. Then, a chi-square ranking algorithm is applied for feature
selection in both classification and clustering tasks. Our findings confirm the
presence of MTese in both Neural Machine Translation systems (NMTs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs). Original Chinese texts are nearly perfectly
distinguishable from both LLM and NMT outputs. Notable linguistic patterns in
MT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative
conjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%
classification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and
NMTs using more brackets. Additionally, translation-specific LLMs show lower
lexical diversity but higher usage of causal conjunctions compared to generic
LLMs. Lastly, we find no significant differences between LLMs developed by
Chinese firms and their foreign counterparts.

Method: 通过实证研究发现首步推理对最终预测影响巨大，提出利用奖励模型筛选高质量首步推理的采样策略。

Result: 该方法在DeepSeek-R1和Qwen3模型上实现了推理成本降低70%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了新基准以系统评估模型自我修正能力，为未来LLM稳健推理研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
advanced complex reasoning capabilities, particularly through extended
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning that incorporates mechanisms such as
backtracking, self-reflection and self-correction. Despite these developments,
the self-correction abilities of LLMs during long CoT reasoning remain
underexplored. And recent findings on overthinking suggest that such models
often engage in unnecessarily redundant reasoning. In this work, we empirically
show that the first reasoning step exerts a disproportionately large influence
on the final prediction - errors introduced at this stage can substantially
degrade subsequent reasoning quality. This phenomenon is consistently observed
across two state-of-the-art open-source reasoning model families: DeepSeek-R1
and Qwen3. To address this, we propose an efficient sampling strategy that
leverages a reward model to identify and retain high-quality first reasoning
steps while discarding suboptimal ones, achieving up to a 70% reduction in
inference cost without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we introduce a new
benchmark specifically constructed with deliberately flawed first reasoning
steps to systematically evaluate model self-correction capabilities, offering a
foundation for future research on robust reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了数字平台的社交语言动态，为理解在线空间中的意识形态和社会结构提供了新视角。

Abstract: Language is a fundamental aspect of human societies, continuously evolving in
response to various stimuli, including societal changes and intercultural
interactions. Technological advancements have profoundly transformed
communication, with social media emerging as a pivotal force that merges
entertainment-driven content with complex social dynamics. As these platforms
reshape public discourse, analyzing the linguistic features of user-generated
content is essential to understanding their broader societal impact. In this
paper, we examine the linguistic complexity of content produced by influential
users on Twitter across three globally significant and contested topics:
COVID-19, COP26, and the Russia-Ukraine war. By combining multiple measures of
textual complexity, we assess how language use varies along four key
dimensions: account type, political leaning, content reliability, and
sentiment. Our analysis reveals significant differences across all four axes,
including variations in language complexity between individuals and
organizations, between profiles with sided versus moderate political views, and
between those associated with higher versus lower reliability scores.
Additionally, profiles producing more negative and offensive content tend to
use more complex language, with users sharing similar political stances and
reliability levels converging toward a common jargon. Our findings offer new
insights into the sociolinguistic dynamics of digital platforms and contribute
to a deeper understanding of how language reflects ideological and social
structures in online spaces.

Method: 使用性能验证、自动电路发现（直接路径修补）和直接对数归因等技术，分离出候选电路。

Result: 仅需网络的一小部分组件即可完成基础任务，但在复杂场景中需要更多组件。

Conclusion: 主谓一致任务由特定子网络完成，且其复杂性影响所需组件的数量。

Abstract: I implement a procedure to isolate and interpret the sub-network (or
"circuit") responsible for subject-verb agreement in GPT-2 Small. In this
study, the model is given prompts where the subject is either singular (e.g.
"Alice") or plural (e.g. "Alice and Bob"), and the task is to correctly predict
the appropriate verb form ("walks" for singular subjects, "walk" for plural
subjects). Using a series of techniques-including performance verification
automatic circuit discovery via direct path patching, and direct logit
attribution- I isolate a candidate circuit that contributes significantly to
the model's correct verb conjugation. The results suggest that only a small
fraction of the network's component-token pairs is needed to achieve near-model
performance on the base task but substantially more for more complex settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有专利检索数据集缺乏明确的领域标注、多司法管辖区覆盖和平衡的查询领域表示，且计算资源需求高。

Method: 通过三步数据整理流程构建DAPFAM数据集，包含1,247个领域平衡的查询家族和45,336个目标家族，使用IPC代码进行领域标注。

Result: 数据集包含49,869个评估对，支持跨领域专利检索实验，基线实验显示跨领域检索存在显著挑战。

Conclusion: DAPFAM填补了专利检索数据集的空白，支持有限计算资源下的子文档级检索实验。

Abstract: In the landscape of publicly available patent retrieval datasets, the need
for explicit indomain and out-of-domain labeling, multi-jurisdiction coverage,
balanced query domain representation and manageable sizes that support sub
document level experiments on moderate computational resources is often
overlooked. To address these gaps, we propose DAPFAM, a new open access
domain-aware patent retrieval dataset constructed at the simple-family level.
The dataset contains 1,247 domain balanced full text query families and 45,336
full text target families. The dataset is enriched by clear relevance judgments
(forward/backward citations as positive links, random negatives), as well as
explicit in-domain or out-of-domain relationships via a novel proposed
labelling scheme based on via International Patent Classification (IPC) codes,
resulting in 49,869 evaluation pairs. The dataset is multi jurisdictional,
requires little to no preprocessing for retrieval evaluation, and remains of a
size manageable for entities with limited ressources allowing for sub document
level retrieval experiments without excessive computational costs. We describe
our three-step data-curation pipeline, present comprehensive dataset
statistics, and provide baseline experiments using lexical and neural retrieval
methods. Our baseline experiments highlight significant challenges in
crossdomain patent retrieval. The dataset will be publicly available (for now

Result: 在五个任务中，RCO显著优于传统方法和开源模型，提升了批评质量和细化效果。

Conclusion: RCO通过基于细化偏好的监督方案，有效增强了LLM的批评-细化循环。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and
critique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in
various tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques
are most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such
critiques. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{R}efinement-oriented
\textbf{C}ritique \textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to
train critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where
critiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its
responses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these
refinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By
focusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need
for direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving
meaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,
dialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,
and code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional
methods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement
outcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel
supervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive
experimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM
critique-refinement loops.

Result: QM提高了评估稳定性，发现指令调优可能改变偏见方向，且更大模型能更有效利用上下文示例，偏见分数更低。

Conclusion: QM是一种更稳定的LLM偏见评估方法，揭示了模型规模和指令调优对偏见的影响。

Abstract: A growing body of work has been querying LLMs with political questions to
evaluate their potential biases. However, this probing method has limited
stability, making comparisons between models unreliable. In this paper, we
argue that LLMs need more context. We propose a new probing task, Questionnaire
Modeling (QM), that uses human survey data as in-context examples. We show that
QM improves the stability of question-based bias evaluation, and demonstrate
that it may be used to compare instruction-tuned models to their base versions.
Experiments with LLMs of various sizes indicate that instruction tuning can
indeed change the direction of bias. Furthermore, we observe a trend that
larger models are able to leverage in-context examples more effectively, and
generally exhibit smaller bias scores in QM. Data and code are publicly
available.

Result: 在医疗数据集上表现优异，在Kaggle和OpenML数据集上因利用上下文信息而显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 未来研究需更多真实世界数据集以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for detecting personal data in structured
datasets, leveraging GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art Large Language Model. A key
innovation of our method is the incorporation of contextual information: in
addition to a feature's name and values, we utilize information from other
feature names within the dataset as well as the dataset description. We compare
our approach to alternative methods, including Microsoft Presidio and CASSED,
evaluating them on multiple datasets: DeSSI, a large synthetic dataset,
datasets we collected from Kaggle and OpenML as well as MIMIC-Demo-Ext, a
real-world dataset containing patient information from critical care units.
  Our findings reveal that detection performance varies significantly depending
on the dataset used for evaluation. CASSED excels on DeSSI, the dataset on
which it was trained. Performance on the medical dataset MIMIC-Demo-Ext is
comparable across all models, with our GPT-4o-based approach clearly
outperforming the others. Notably, personal data detection in the Kaggle and
OpenML datasets appears to benefit from contextual information. This is
evidenced by the poor performance of CASSED and Presidio (both of which do not
utilize the context of the dataset) compared to the strong results of our
GPT-4o-based approach.
  We conclude that further progress in this field would greatly benefit from
the availability of more real-world datasets containing personal information.

Motivation: LLM作为评分法官被广泛应用，但其评分偏见影响了公平性和可靠性，目前对评分偏见的系统性研究较少。

Method: 通过数据合成构建评估数据集，设计多维度评估指标，定义评分偏见并设计评估框架。

Result: 实验表明现有评分模型的稳定性受评分偏见干扰，探索性实验为评分提示模板设计和偏见缓解提供了见解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM评分偏见的严重性，为未来评分系统的设计和偏见缓解提供了方向。

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) gives rise
to``LLM-as-a-Judge'', where LLMs are employed as evaluators for complex tasks.
Moreover, it has been widely adopted across fields such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP), preference learning, and various specific domains. However,
there are various biases within LLM-as-a-Judge, which adversely affect the
fairness and reliability of judgments. Current research on evaluating or
mitigating bias in LLM-as-a-Judge predominantly focuses on comparison-based
evaluations, while systematic investigations into bias in scoring-based
evaluations remain limited. Therefore, we define scoring bias in LLM-as-a-Judge
as the scores differ when scoring judge models are bias-related perturbed, and
provide a well-designed framework to comprehensively evaluate scoring bias. We
augment existing LLM-as-a-Judge benchmarks through data synthesis to construct
our evaluation dataset and design multi-faceted evaluation metrics. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the scoring stability of existing judge
models is disrupted by scoring biases. Further exploratory experiments and
discussions provide valuable insights into the design of scoring prompt
templates and the mitigation of scoring biases on aspects such as score
rubrics, score IDs, and reference answer selection.

Motivation: 人类语言解析策略并非随机，但此前研究表明随机策略的代理仍能实现高通信准确性，研究旨在验证这一现象是否在更复杂条件下成立。

Method: 通过使用具有层次结构的复杂输入和引入意外性相关目标函数，评估随机解析策略的通信准确性。

Result: 未明确提及具体结果，但研究设计旨在验证随机策略在复杂条件下的表现。

Conclusion: 研究旨在揭示随机解析策略在更接近自然语言条件下的适用性。

Abstract: If humans understood language by randomly selecting parsing actions, it might
have been necessary to construct a robust symbolic system capable of being
interpreted under any hierarchical structure. However, human parsing strategies
do not seem to follow such a random pattern. Why is that the case? In fact, a
previous study on emergent communication using models with hierarchical biases
have reported that agents adopting random parsing
strategies$\unicode{x2013}$ones that deviate significantly from human language
comprehension$\unicode{x2013}$can achieve high communication accuracy. In this
study, we investigate this issue by making two simple and natural modifications
to the experimental setup: (I) we use more complex inputs that have
hierarchical structures, such that random parsing makes semantic interpretation
more difficult, and (II) we incorporate a surprisal-related term, which is
known to influence the order of words and characters in natural language, into
the objective function. With these changes, we evaluate whether agents
employing random parsing strategies still maintain high communication accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理时延迟和能耗占主导地位，现有方法需重新训练或改变架构，QuickSilver旨在不改变模型权重或结构的情况下优化推理效率。

Method: QuickSilver结合动态令牌停止、KV缓存跳过和上下文令牌融合三种机制，减少计算和内存开销。

Result: 在GPT-2和Llama-2上，QuickSilver实现了高达39.6%的FLOP减少，困惑度增加可忽略（≤0.2）。

Conclusion: QuickSilver提供了一种无需修改模型的高效推理优化方案，适用于现有密集模型。

Abstract: Inference accounts for the majority of latency and energy consumption in
large language model (LLM) deployments, often exceeding 90% of total cost.
While training-time efficiency has seen extensive progress, runtime
optimization remains a key bottleneck, particularly under autoregressive
decoding. Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,
and speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or
disrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,
token-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time
without altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four
synergistic mechanisms:
  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged
representations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory
writes to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which
collapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.
  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on
frozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and
Llama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP
reduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).

errors. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments, investigating the
Czech GEC corpora as bases for synthetic error introduction, several error
generation strategies, domain balancing, tokenization granularity, model size,
and data scaling during fine-tuning. Additionally, we evaluate the performance
of large language models (LLMs) on Czech GEC in both end-user and expert
fine-tuning scenarios. Our best-performing model is superior both in
performance and computational efficiency. The source code and the trained model

Method: 采用Peri-LN Transformer架构，通过三阶段课程学习扩展上下文窗口至128K token，并结合监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在KMMLU、CSAT等韩国基准测试中表现优异，且训练计算成本低于同类模型。

Conclusion: HyperCLOVA X THINK为韩国AI创新提供了坚实基础，并有望通过开源和商业友好模式进一步推广。

Abstract: We introduce HyperCLOVA X THINK, the first reasoning-focused large language
model in the HyperCLOVA X family, pre-trained on roughly $6$ trillion
high-quality Korean, and English tokens, augmented with targeted synthetic
Korean data. It was implemented as a compute-memory-balanced Peri-LN
Transformer scaled with $\mu$P, pre-trained through a three-stage curriculum
that expands the context window to $128$K tokens, and post-trained via
supervised fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards
supports both detailed rationale and concise-answer modes. It delivers
competitive performance against similarly sized models on Korea-focused
benchmarks such as KMMLU, CSAT, KoBALT-700, HAERAE-1.0, and KoBigBench, while
preserving robust bilingual consistency and translation quality. In addition, a
vision-augmented variant matches or exceeds GPT-4.1 on the KCSAT STEM
benchmark, all of which are achieved with substantially lower training compute
than existing models of similar sizes. We also present a pruning and
distillation technique that will soon be applied to HyperCLOVA X THINK for an
open-source and business-friendly foundation model. Altogether, these
capabilities position HyperCLOVA X THINK as a robust foundation for Korean AI
innovation and a valuable resource for the global research community.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark和MAI-DxO，通过模拟临床诊断的迭代过程，显著提高了AI的诊断准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估方法无法反映真实临床诊断的复杂性，需要一种更贴近实际的方法来评估AI在医学诊断中的表现。

Method: 将304个NEJM-CPC案例转化为逐步诊断过程，引入MAI-DxO模型，模拟医生团队并提出高效诊断策略。

Result: MAI-DxO与OpenAI o3模型结合，诊断准确率达80%，成本降低20%；最高配置下准确率达85.5%。

Conclusion: AI系统通过迭代思考和高效行动，可显著提升临床诊断的精确性和成本效益。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for expanding access to expert
medical knowledge and reasoning. However, most evaluations of language models
rely on static vignettes and multiple-choice questions that fail to reflect the
complexity and nuance of evidence-based medicine in real-world settings. In
clinical practice, physicians iteratively formulate and revise diagnostic
hypotheses, adapting each subsequent question and test to what they've just
learned, and weigh the evolving evidence before committing to a final
diagnosis. To emulate this iterative process, we introduce the Sequential
Diagnosis Benchmark, which transforms 304 diagnostically challenging New
England Journal of Medicine clinicopathological conference (NEJM-CPC) cases
into stepwise diagnostic encounters. A physician or AI begins with a short case
abstract and must iteratively request additional details from a gatekeeper
model that reveals findings only when explicitly queried. Performance is
assessed not just by diagnostic accuracy but also by the cost of physician
visits and tests performed. We also present the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator
(MAI-DxO), a model-agnostic orchestrator that simulates a panel of physicians,
proposes likely differential diagnoses and strategically selects high-value,
cost-effective tests. When paired with OpenAI's o3 model, MAI-DxO achieves 80%
diagnostic accuracy--four times higher than the 20% average of generalist
physicians. MAI-DxO also reduces diagnostic costs by 20% compared to
physicians, and 70% compared to off-the-shelf o3. When configured for maximum
accuracy, MAI-DxO achieves 85.5% accuracy. These performance gains with MAI-DxO
generalize across models from the OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, and
Llama families. We highlight how AI systems, when guided to think iteratively
and act judiciously, can advance diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness in
clinical care.

### [121] [End-to-End RGB-IR Joint Image Compression With Channel-wise Cross-modality Entropy Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21851)
*Haofeng Wang,Fangtao Zhou,Qi Zhang,Zeyuan Chen,Enci Zhang,Zhao Wang,Xiaofeng Huang,Siwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于RGB-IR图像对联合压缩的框架，通过跨模态熵模型（CCEM）提升压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据（如RGB-IR）应用的增加，存储和传输成本成倍增长，因此需要高效的压缩方法。

Method: 设计了CCEM模型，包括低频上下文提取块（LCEB）和低频上下文融合块（LCFB），以利用跨模态先验信息进行精确的概率建模。

Result: 在LLVIP和KAIST数据集上优于现有方法，例如在LLVIP上比特率节省23.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态信息利用显著提升了RGB-IR图像对的压缩效率。

Abstract: RGB-IR(RGB-Infrared) image pairs are frequently applied simultaneously in
various applications like intelligent surveillance. However, as the number of
modalities increases, the required data storage and transmission costs also
double. Therefore, efficient RGB-IR data compression is essential. This work
proposes a joint compression framework for RGB-IR image pair. Specifically, to
fully utilize cross-modality prior information for accurate context probability
modeling within and between modalities, we propose a Channel-wise
Cross-modality Entropy Model (CCEM). Among CCEM, a Low-frequency Context
Extraction Block (LCEB) and a Low-frequency Context Fusion Block (LCFB) are
designed for extracting and aggregating the global low-frequency information
from both modalities, which assist the model in predicting entropy parameters
more accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing RGB-IR image pair and single-modality compression methods on LLVIP and
KAIST datasets. For instance, the proposed framework achieves a 23.1% bit rate
saving on LLVIP dataset compared to the state-of-the-art RGB-IR image codec
presented at CVPR 2022.

TL;DR: SpatialReasoner-R1 是一种视觉语言推理模型，通过 M3CTS 和 fDPO 方法提升细粒度空间推理能力，显著优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在细粒度空间推理和多步逻辑对齐方面表现不足，需要改进。

Method: 采用 M3CTS 生成多样且逻辑一致的 LongCoT 轨迹，并提出 fDPO 方法，结合空间奖励机制优化推理。

Result: fDPO 在空间质量任务上平均提升 4.1%，在空间数量任务上提升 9.0%；SpatialReasoner-R1 在 SPATIALRGPT-Bench 上创下新 SoTA。

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner-R1 通过 fDPO 显著提升了空间推理能力，同时保持通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with fine-grained spatial
reasoning, particularly when multi-step logic and precise spatial alignment are
required. In this work, we introduce SpatialReasoner-R1, a vision-language
reasoning model designed to address these limitations. To construct
high-quality supervision for spatial reasoning, we design a Multi-Model Monte
Carlo Tree Search (M3CTS) method that generates diverse, logically consistent
Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning trajectories. In addition, we propose
fine-grained Direct Preference Optimization (fDPO), which introduces
segment-specific preference granularity for descriptive grounding and logical
reasoning, guided by a spatial reward mechanism that evaluates candidate
responses based on visual consistency, spatial grounding, and logical
coherence. Experimental results demonstrate that fDPO achieves an average
improvement of 4.1% over standard DPO across spatial quality tasks, and a 9.0%
gain in spatial quantity tasks. SpatialReasoner-R1, trained with fDPO, sets a
new SoTA on SPATIALRGPT-Bench, outperforming the strongest baseline by 9.8% in
average accuracy, while maintaining competitive performance on general
vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Scissor是一种无需训练的令牌压缩策略，用于视频多模态大型语言模型，通过语义连通组件（SCC）实现全面的语义覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于注意力分数压缩令牌，但无法有效捕捉所有语义区域且导致冗余。

Method: 提出两步时空令牌压缩策略，利用SCC在空间和时间域中分配令牌。

Result: 在多种视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在低令牌保留率下。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Scissor在令牌压缩方面优于其他方法，适用于视频多模态任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression
strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods
mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to
effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy.
Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC)
approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set,
ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step
spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial
and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by
representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We
conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of
LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video
question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices
benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor
outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in
various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention
ratios. Project page: https://github.com/HumanMLLM/LLaVA-Scissor.

Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在全景图像生成中存在几何失真和环一致性挑战，需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: TanDiT使用统一的扩散模型在单次去噪迭代中同时生成切平面图像，并提出模型无关的后处理步骤以增强全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TanDiT能有效泛化到训练数据之外，处理复杂文本提示，并与其他生成模型集成，生成高质量全景图像。

Conclusion: TanDiT通过创新方法解决了全景图像生成的挑战，并提供了专用评估指标和基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to remarkable improvements in
synthesizing perspective images. However, these models still struggle with
panoramic image generation due to unique challenges, including varying levels
of geometric distortion and the requirement for seamless loop-consistency. To
address these issues while leveraging the strengths of the existing models, we
introduce TanDiT, a method that synthesizes panoramic scenes by generating
grids of tangent-plane images covering the entire 360$^\circ$ view. Unlike
previous methods relying on multiple diffusion branches, TanDiT utilizes a
unified diffusion model trained to produce these tangent-plane images
simultaneously within a single denoising iteration. Furthermore, we propose a
model-agnostic post-processing step specifically designed to enhance global
coherence across the generated panoramas. To accurately assess panoramic image
quality, we also present two specialized metrics, TangentIS and TangentFID, and
provide a comprehensive benchmark comprising captioned panoramic datasets and
standardized evaluation scripts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method generalizes effectively beyond its training data, robustly interprets
detailed and complex text prompts, and seamlessly integrates with various
generative models to yield high-quality, diverse panoramic images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉裁剪方法在细粒度VQA任务中需要任务特定微调、效率低或与高效注意力实现不兼容的问题。

Method: 通过四个步骤实现：识别目标对象、计算对象相关性图、提出并排序相关图像区域、使用排名最高的区域执行VQA任务。

Result: 在四个细粒度VQA数据集和两种MLLM上表现优异，优于三种流行视觉裁剪方法，计算量减少3-6.5倍。

Conclusion: FOCUS是一种高效且无需训练的视觉裁剪方法，显著提升了细粒度VQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong perception and
reasoning capabilities for image-text input, Visual Question Answering (VQA)
focusing on small image details still remains a challenge. Although visual
cropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:
the need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed
exhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.
We address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping
method, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the
search for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:
first, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute
an object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and
rank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the
fine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed
search strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA
datasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping
methods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing
baseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.

Motivation: 现有方法忽略了人类属性对运动模式的影响，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 模型能够生成与用户文本和属性输入一致的、真实的属性感知运动。

Conclusion: 通过引入HumanAttr数据集和实验验证，证明了模型在属性感知文本到运动生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-driven human motion generation has recently attracted considerable
attention, allowing models to generate human motions based on textual
descriptions. However, current methods neglect the influence of human
attributes (such as age, gender, weight, and height) which are key factors
shaping human motion patterns. This work represents a pilot exploration for
bridging this gap. We conceptualize each motion as comprising both attribute
information and action semantics, where textual descriptions align exclusively
with action semantics. To achieve this, a new framework inspired by Structural
Causal Models is proposed to decouple action semantics from human attributes,
enabling text-to-semantics prediction and attribute-controlled generation. The
resulting model is capable of generating realistic, attribute-aware motion
aligned with the user's text and attribute inputs. For evaluation, we introduce
HumanAttr, a comprehensive dataset containing attribute annotations for
text-motion pairs, setting the first benchmark for attribute-aware
text-to-motion generation. Extensive experiments on the new dataset validate
our model's effectiveness.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有CNN-Transformer模型在时空特征融合上存在局限性，需要更高效的交互方式。

Method: 采用交叉注意力机制动态融合时空特征，增强对细微时间演化伪造痕迹（如闪烁的眼睛或扭曲的嘴唇）的检测能力。

Result: 在FaceForensics++、Celeb-DF和DeepfakeDetection数据集上表现优异，AUC达99.49%，准确率97.57%；跨数据集测试AUC为93.31%。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力特征融合显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和性能，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Deepfakes have emerged as a significant threat to digital media authenticity,
increasing the need for advanced detection techniques that can identify subtle
and time-dependent manipulations. CNNs are effective at capturing spatial
artifacts, and Transformers excel at modeling temporal inconsistencies.
However, many existing CNN-Transformer models process spatial and temporal
features independently. In particular, attention-based methods often use
separate attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal features and combine
them using naive approaches like averaging, addition, or concatenation, which
limits the depth of spatio-temporal interaction. To address this challenge, we
propose a unified CAST model that leverages cross-attention to effectively fuse
spatial and temporal features in a more integrated manner. Our approach allows
temporal features to dynamically attend to relevant spatial regions, enhancing
the model's ability to detect fine-grained, time-evolving artifacts such as
flickering eyes or warped lips. This design enables more precise localization
and deeper contextual understanding, leading to improved performance across
diverse and challenging scenarios. We evaluate the performance of our model
using the FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DeepfakeDetection datasets in both
intra- and cross-dataset settings to affirm the superiority of our approach.
Our model achieves strong performance with an AUC of 99.49 percent and an
accuracy of 97.57 percent in intra-dataset evaluations. In cross-dataset
testing, it demonstrates impressive generalization by achieving a 93.31 percent
AUC on the unseen DeepfakeDetection dataset. These results highlight the
effectiveness of cross-attention-based feature fusion in enhancing the
robustness of deepfake video detection.

Conclusion: 所提框架可无缝集成到现有通用IR架构中，为扩散训练范式在IR任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models demonstrate strong generative capabilities in image
restoration (IR) tasks, their complex architectures and iterative processes
limit their practical application compared to mainstream reconstruction-based
general ordinary IR networks. Existing approaches primarily focus on optimizing
network architecture and diffusion paths but overlook the integration of the
diffusion training paradigm within general ordinary IR frameworks. To address
these challenges, this paper elucidates key principles for adapting the
diffusion training paradigm to general IR training through systematic analysis
of time-step dependencies, network hierarchies, noise-level relationships, and
multi-restoration task correlations, proposing a new IR framework supported by
diffusion-based training. To enable IR networks to simultaneously restore
images and model generative representations, we introduce a series of
regularization strategies that align diffusion objectives with IR tasks,
improving generalization in single-task scenarios. Furthermore, recognizing
that diffusion-based generation exerts varying influences across different IR
tasks, we develop an incremental training paradigm and task-specific adaptors,
further enhancing performance in multi-task unified IR. Experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the generalization of IR networks in
single-task IR and achieves superior performance in multi-task unified IR.
Notably, the proposed framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing
general IR architectures.

Conclusion: AsymDSD通过创新设计显著提升了3D点云语义表示的性能，为自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning semantically meaningful representations from unstructured 3D point
clouds remains a central challenge in computer vision, especially in the
absence of large-scale labeled datasets. While masked point modeling (MPM) is
widely used in self-supervised 3D learning, its reconstruction-based objective
can limit its ability to capture high-level semantics. We propose AsymDSD, an
Asymmetric Dual Self-Distillation framework that unifies masked modeling and
invariance learning through prediction in the latent space rather than the
input space. AsymDSD builds on a joint embedding architecture and introduces
several key design choices: an efficient asymmetric setup, disabling attention
between masked queries to prevent shape leakage, multi-mask sampling, and a
point cloud adaptation of multi-crop. AsymDSD achieves state-of-the-art results
on ScanObjectNN (90.53%) and further improves to 93.72% when pretrained on 930k
shapes, surpassing prior methods.

Motivation: 研究概率生成模型的局限性，特别是全局分布学习导致记忆而非生成行为的问题。

Method: 提出MESP框架改进VAE，引入BL-AE编码二进制潜在表示，并设计ARVM输出直方图。基于MESP，提出LCH假设，强调局部相关性对生成能力的影响。

Result: ARVM在标准数据集上取得竞争性FID分数，但发现高分反映的是记忆而非生成能力。LCH假设通过实验验证了局部相关性的重要性。

Conclusion: MESP和LCH框架揭示了概率生成模型的局限性，并提出了改进方向，强调局部相关性对生成能力的关键作用。

Abstract: We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability
Space (MESP) and the Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), to explore a potential
limitation in probabilistic generative models; namely that learning global
distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. MESP
emerges from our rethinking of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). We observe
that latent variable distributions in VAE exhibit overlap, which leads to an
optimization conflict between the reconstruction loss and KL-divergence loss. A
lower bound based on the overlap coefficient is proposed. We refer to this
phenomenon as Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces. Based on MESP, a Binary
Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) is proposed to encode images into binary latent
representations. These binary latents are used as the input to our
Autoregressive Random Variable Model (ARVM), a modified autoregressive model
outputting histograms. Our ARVM achieves competitive FID scores, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets. However, such scores reflect
memorization rather than generation. To address this issue, we propose the
Local Correlation Hypothesis (LCH), which posits that generative capability
arising from local correlations among latent variables. Comprehensive
experiments and discussions are conducted to validate our frameworks.

Conclusion: ImplicitQA为视频问答领域提供了新的挑战，推动了隐含推理研究的发展。

Abstract: Video QA has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to
align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly
focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions,
objects & events directly observable within individual frames or short clips.
In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and
narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately
omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, causality, and
relationships across discontinuous frames. Humans naturally excel at such
implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context
to construct coherent narratives. Current VideoQA systems and benchmarks fail
to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this
gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test
models on implicit reasoning. It comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs
derived from 320+ high-quality creative video clips, systematically categorized
into key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth
and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and
motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred
counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors
ensuring high-quality. Our extensive evaluations on leading VideoQA models
reveals performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level
visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. Performance
variations across models further illustrate the complexity and diversity of the
challenges presented by ImplicitQA. By releasing both the dataset and our data
collection framework, we aim to stimulate further research and development in
the community. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, but early detection
can significantly improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods
are often invasive and require specialized equipment. In this work, we present
a deep learning pipeline using the EfficientNet-B0 architecture for glaucoma
detection from retinal fundus images. Unlike prior studies that rely on single
datasets, we sequentially train and fine-tune our model across ACRIMA, ORIGA,
and RIM-ONE datasets to enhance generalization. Our experiments show that
minimal preprocessing yields higher AUC-ROC compared to more complex
enhancements, and our model demonstrates strong discriminative performance on
unseen datasets. The proposed pipeline offers a reproducible and scalable
approach to early glaucoma detection, supporting its potential clinical

Motivation: 研究旨在评估不同计算机视觉范式在第一人称视频中的表现，推动该领域的技术发展。

Method: 通过评估Shotluck Holmes（监督学习）、TAC-SUM（无监督学习）和GPT-4o（提示微调）在视频摘要任务中的表现，分析其有效性。

Result: 当前先进模型在第一人称视频中表现较差，而GPT-4o表现更优，表明现有方法需改进以适应第一人称视角。

Conclusion: 研究为第一人称视频处理提供了概念验证，强调需要进一步开发适应其独特挑战的模型。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate various computer vision paradigms - supervised
learning, unsupervised learning, and prompt fine-tuning - by assessing their
ability to understand and interpret egocentric video data. Specifically, we
examine Shotluck Holmes (state-of-the-art supervised learning), TAC-SUM
(state-of-the-art unsupervised learning), and GPT-4o (a prompt fine-tuned
pre-trained model), evaluating their effectiveness in video summarization. Our
results demonstrate that current state-of-the-art models perform less
effectively on first-person videos compared to third-person videos,
highlighting the need for further advancements in the egocentric video domain.
Notably, a prompt fine-tuned general-purpose GPT-4o model outperforms these
specialized models, emphasizing the limitations of existing approaches in
adapting to the unique challenges of first-person perspectives. Although our
evaluation is conducted on a small subset of egocentric videos from the
Ego-Exo4D dataset due to resource constraints, the primary objective of this
research is to provide a comprehensive proof-of-concept analysis aimed at
advancing the application of computer vision techniques to first-person videos.
By exploring novel methodologies and evaluating their potential, we aim to
contribute to the ongoing development of models capable of effectively
processing and interpreting egocentric perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集仅关注手术分析的孤立方面（如工具检测或阶段分割），缺乏对实体间语义关系的全面表示。

Method: 引入CAT-SG数据集，提供工具-组织交互、程序变化和时间依赖的结构化标注，并提出场景图生成模型CatSGG。

Result: CAT-SG提供了手术工作流的整体视图，CatSGG在生成结构化手术表示方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAT-SG数据集和CatSGG模型为AI驱动的临床实践（如手术培训和实时决策支持）提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding the intricate workflows of cataract surgery requires modeling
complex interactions between surgical tools, anatomical structures, and
procedural techniques. Existing datasets primarily address isolated aspects of
surgical analysis, such as tool detection or phase segmentation, but lack
comprehensive representations that capture the semantic relationships between
entities over time. This paper introduces the Cataract Surgery Scene Graph
(CAT-SG) dataset, the first to provide structured annotations of tool-tissue
interactions, procedural variations, and temporal dependencies. By
incorporating detailed semantic relations, CAT-SG offers a holistic view of
surgical workflows, enabling more accurate recognition of surgical phases and
techniques. Additionally, we present a novel scene graph generation model,
CatSGG, which outperforms current methods in generating structured surgical
representations. The CAT-SG dataset is designed to enhance AI-driven surgical
training, real-time decision support, and workflow analysis, paving the way for
more intelligent, context-aware systems in clinical practice.

Conclusion: 方法减少了手动标注需求，推动了历史地图的自动化处理与分析。

Abstract: As rich sources of history, maps provide crucial insights into historical
changes, yet their diverse visual representations and limited annotated data
pose significant challenges for automated processing. We propose a simple yet
effective approach for few-shot segmentation of historical maps, leveraging the
rich semantic embeddings of large vision foundation models combined with
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on
the Siegfried benchmark dataset in vineyard and railway segmentation, achieving
+5% and +13% relative improvements in mIoU in 10-shot scenarios and around +20%
in the more challenging 5-shot setting. Additionally, it demonstrates strong
performance on the ICDAR 2021 competition dataset, attaining a mean PQ of 67.3%
for building block segmentation, despite not being optimized for this
shape-sensitive metric, underscoring its generalizability. Notably, our
approach maintains high performance even in extremely low-data regimes (10- &
5-shot), while requiring only 689k trainable parameters - just 0.21% of the
total model size. Our approach enables precise segmentation of diverse
historical maps while drastically reducing the need for manual annotations,
advancing automated processing and analysis in the field. Our implementation is

Motivation: 现有故事生成方法通常将用户视为被动消费者，缺乏个性化，影响了参与度和沉浸感。TaleForge旨在通过个性化文本和图像结合，创造更具吸引力的用户体验。

Method: TaleForge包含三个模块：故事生成（LLMs根据用户提示创建叙事和角色描述）、个性化图像生成（将用户面部和服装融入角色插图）、背景生成（创建包含个性化角色的场景）。

Result: 用户研究表明，当用户作为主角出现时，参与感和归属感显著提升。系统获得实时预览和直观控制的积极反馈，但用户希望有更精细的叙事编辑工具。

Conclusion: TaleForge通过个性化文本和图像的对齐，推动了多模态故事叙述的发展，创造了沉浸式、以用户为中心的体验。

Abstract: Storytelling is a deeply personal and creative process, yet existing methods
often treat users as passive consumers, offering generic plots with limited
personalization. This undermines engagement and immersion, especially where
individual style or appearance is crucial. We introduce TaleForge, a
personalized story-generation system that integrates large language models
(LLMs) and text-to-image diffusion to embed users' facial images within both
narratives and illustrations. TaleForge features three interconnected modules:
Story Generation, where LLMs create narratives and character descriptions from
user prompts; Personalized Image Generation, merging users' faces and outfit
choices into character illustrations; and Background Generation, creating scene
backdrops that incorporate personalized characters. A user study demonstrated
heightened engagement and ownership when individuals appeared as protagonists.
Participants praised the system's real-time previews and intuitive controls,
though they requested finer narrative editing tools. TaleForge advances
multimodal storytelling by aligning personalized text and imagery to create
immersive, user-centric experiences.

TL;DR: 论文提出ADL和AAM方法，通过利用误差分布特性改进CNN在面部对齐中的性能，并在多个数据集上取得最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究面部对齐中误差分布的偏差问题，发现误差沿切线方向分布的特性，并探索如何利用这一特性改进模型收敛。

Method: 提出各向异性方向损失（ADL）和各向异性注意力模块（AAM），分别用于坐标和热图回归，并结合为ADNet端到端训练框架。

Result: 在300W、WFLW和COFW数据集上取得最优性能，验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过ADL和AAM的互补作用，成功利用误差分布特性提升面部对齐性能，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recent progress of CNN has dramatically improved face alignment
performance. However, few works have paid attention to the error-bias with
respect to error distribution of facial landmarks. In this paper, we
investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of
landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This
error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous
landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage
the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we
propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM)
for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding
force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries. On the
other hand, AAM is an attention module which can get anisotropic attention mask
focusing on the region of point and its local edge connected by adjacent
points, it has a stronger response in tangent than in normal, which means
relaxed constraints in the tangent. These two methods work in a complementary
manner to learn both facial structures and texture details. Finally, we
integrate them into an optimized end-to-end training pipeline named ADNet. Our
ADNet achieves state-of-the-art results on 300W, WFLW and COFW datasets, which
demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness.

Motivation: 医学图像修复（如息肉图像）的准确性对诊断至关重要，现有模型可能生成不准确图像，需专家标注和反馈以提高可靠性。

Method: 提出PrefPaint，将人类反馈直接融入Stable Diffusion Inpainting训练过程，避免昂贵奖励模型；开发基于Web的交互界面简化训练和微调。

Result: PrefPaint在多项测试中优于现有方法，减少视觉不一致性，提升图像渲染质量，尤其在医学领域生成更真实的息肉图像。

Conclusion: PrefPaint通过结合人类反馈和高效交互界面，显著提升医学图像修复的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Inpainting, the process of filling missing or corrupted image parts, has
broad applications, including medical imaging. However, in specialized fields
like medical polyps imaging, where accuracy and reliability are critical,
inpainting models can generate inaccurate images, leading to significant errors
in medical diagnosis and treatment. To ensure reliability, medical images
should be annotated by experts like oncologists for effective model training.
We propose PrefPaint, an approach that incorporates human feedback into the
training process of Stable Diffusion Inpainting, bypassing the need for
computationally expensive reward models. In addition, we develop a web-based
interface streamlines training, fine-tuning, and inference. This interactive
interface provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, making it easier to
offer feedback and manage the fine-tuning process. User study on various
domains shows that PrefPaint outperforms existing methods, reducing visual
inconsistencies and improving image rendering, particularly in medical
contexts, where our model generates more realistic polyps images.

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外成本即可提升地标密度和精度，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant growth of face alignment. Though
dense facial landmark is highly demanded in various scenarios, e.g., cosmetic
medicine and facial beautification, most works only consider sparse face
alignment. To address this problem, we present a framework that can enrich
landmark density by existing sparse landmark datasets, e.g., 300W with 68
points and WFLW with 98 points. Firstly, we observe that the local patches
along each semantic contour are highly similar in appearance. Then, we propose
a weakly-supervised idea of learning the refinement ability on original sparse
landmarks and adapting this ability to enriched dense landmarks. Meanwhile,
several operators are devised and organized together to implement the idea.
Finally, the trained model is applied as a plug-and-play module to the existing
face alignment networks. To evaluate our method, we manually label the dense
landmarks on 300W testset. Our method yields state-of-the-art accuracy not only
in newly-constructed dense 300W testset but also in the original sparse 300W
and WFLW testsets without additional cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAM方法在视觉参考分割中因提示编码器不理想而在边界生成提示，导致不稳定性和鲁棒性下降。

Method: ProSAM通过学习变分提示编码器预测多变量提示分布，避免在不稳定区域生成提示。

Result: ProSAM在Pascal-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ProSAM为视觉参考分割提供了更稳定和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of
open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond
predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes,
texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its
unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several
SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically
generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts
at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in
instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple
but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in
existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a
variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM
avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the
instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets,
providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

Abstract: Geologic map, as a fundamental diagram in geology science, provides critical
insights into the structure and composition of Earth's subsurface and surface.
These maps are indispensable in various fields, including disaster detection,
resource exploration, and civil engineering. Despite their significance,
current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often fall short in geologic
map understanding. This gap is primarily due to the challenging nature of
cartographic generalization, which involves handling high-resolution map,
managing multiple associated components, and requiring domain-specific
knowledge. To quantify this gap, we construct GeoMap-Bench, the first-ever
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in geologic map understanding, which assesses
the full-scale abilities in extracting, referring, grounding, reasoning, and
analyzing. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeoMap-Agent, the inaugural agent
designed for geologic map understanding, which features three modules:
Hierarchical Information Extraction (HIE), Domain Knowledge Injection (DKI),
and Prompt-enhanced Question Answering (PEQA). Inspired by the
interdisciplinary collaboration among human scientists, an AI expert group acts

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种创新的EEG编码器架构，结合双重自注意力机制和混合训练策略，成功从EEG数据中重建3D物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅将脑电活动转换为2D图像，忽略了3D空间信息的重建，限制了BCI的实际应用。本文旨在解决这一局限。

Method: 采用双重自注意力机制的EEG编码器，结合交叉注意力、对比学习和自监督学习的混合训练策略，并利用稳定扩散和变分分数蒸馏生成3D物体。

Result: 成功从EEG数据中生成了内容和结构相似的3D物体。

Conclusion: 该方法为从EEG数据重建3D视觉刺激提供了新思路，扩展了BCI的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D visual stimuli from Electroencephalography (EEG) data holds
significant potential for applications in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and
aiding individuals with communication disorders. Traditionally, efforts have
focused on converting brain activity into 2D images, neglecting the translation
of EEG data into 3D objects. This limitation is noteworthy, as the human brain
inherently processes three-dimensional spatial information regardless of
whether observing 2D images or the real world. The neural activities captured
by EEG contain rich spatial information that is inevitably lost when
reconstructing only 2D images, thus limiting its practical applications in BCI.
The transition from EEG data to 3D object reconstruction faces considerable
obstacles. These include the presence of extensive noise within EEG signals and
a scarcity of datasets that include both EEG and 3D information, which
complicates the extraction process of 3D visual data. Addressing this
challenging task, we propose an innovative EEG encoder architecture that
integrates a dual self-attention mechanism. We use a hybrid training strategy
to train the EEG Encoder, which includes cross-attention, contrastive learning,
and self-supervised learning techniques. Additionally, by employing stable
diffusion as a prior distribution and utilizing Variational Score Distillation
to train a neural radiation field, we successfully generate 3D objects with
similar content and structure from EEG data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从面部视频中捕捉周期性信号（如皮肤色调的细微变化）对rPPG估计至关重要，但现有方法缺乏通用表示学习能力。

Method: 使用视频掩码自编码器（MAE）进行自监督学习，结合帧掩码和生理带宽限制约束，捕捉周期性信号。

Result: 在PURE、UBFC-rPPG、MMPD和V4V数据集上表现优异，尤其在跨数据集评估中显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习有效提取周期性信号，为rPPG任务提供了通用表示。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method that learns a general representation of
periodic signals from unlabeled facial videos by capturing subtle changes in
skin tone over time. The proposed framework employs the video masked
autoencoder to learn a high-dimensional spatio-temporal representation of the
facial region through self-supervised learning. Capturing quasi-periodic
signals in the video is crucial for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)
estimation. To account for signal periodicity, we apply frame masking in terms
of video sampling, which allows the model to capture resampled quasi-periodic
signals during the pre-training stage. Moreover, the framework incorporates
physiological bandlimit constraints, leveraging the property that physiological
signals are sparse within their frequency bandwidth to provide pulse cues to
the model. The pre-trained encoder is then transferred to the rPPG task, where
it is used to extract physiological signals from facial videos. We evaluate the
proposed method through extensive experiments on the PURE, UBFC-rPPG, MMPD, and
V4V datasets. Our results demonstrate significant performance improvements,
particularly in challenging cross-dataset evaluations. Our code is available at

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep
learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various
pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches
integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the
comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial
transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular
heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining. We introduce
SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide
image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an
ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique,
where experts, created via two-stage feature-space clustering, use contrastive
learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene
expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is
evaluated on 14 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot
performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of
integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space.

Motivation: 通用大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在自然图像领域表现优异，但在遥感（RS）领域由于视觉外观、对象尺度和语义的显著差异，其应用受限。

Method: 框架包含两个核心组件：1）基于检索的语义增强模块，用于多级视觉特征对齐；2）语义感知专家建模，分别处理不同层次的语义表示。

Result: 在多个RS任务（如场景分类和视觉问答）中，该框架实现了跨多语义层次的一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架有效填补了通用LVLM与RS特定需求之间的差距，展示了其在RS视觉语言理解中的能力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across
various vision-language tasks in natural image domains. However, their
application to remote sensing (RS) remains underexplored due to significant
domain differences in visual appearances, object scales, and semantics. These
discrepancies hider the effective understanding of RS scenes, which contain
rich, multi-level semantic information spanning from coarse-to-fine levels.
Hence, it limits the direct adaptation of existing LVLMs to RS imagery. To
address this gap, we propose a novel LVLM framework tailored for RS
understanding, incorporating two core components: Semantic-augmented
Multi-level Alignment and Semantic-aware Expert Modeling. First, to align
multi-level visual features, we introduce the retrieval-based Semantic
Augmentation Module which enriches the visual features with relevant semantics
across fine-to-coarse levels (e.g., object- and scene-level information). It is
designed to retrieve relevant semantic cues from a RS semantic knowledge
database, followed by aggregation of semantic cues with user query and
multi-level visual features, resulting in semantically enriched representation
across multiple levels. Second, for Semantic-aware Expert Modeling, we design
semantic experts, where each expert is responsible for processing semantic
representation at different levels separately. This enables hierarchical
semantic understanding from coarse to fine levels. Evaluations across multiple
RS tasks-including scene classification and VQA, etc.-demonstrate that the
proposed framework achieves consistent improvements across multiple semantic
levels. This highlights its capability and effectiveness in bridging the gap
between general LVLMs and unique demands of RS-specific vision-language
understanding.

Conclusion: DPU-Former通过双视角统一结构和高效融合策略，显著提升了光学遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: Automatically segmenting objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs)
is an important task. Most existing models are primarily based on either
convolutional or Transformer features, each offering distinct advantages.
Exploiting both advantages is valuable research, but it presents several
challenges, including the heterogeneity between the two types of features, high
complexity, and large parameters of the model. However, these issues are often
overlooked in existing the ORSIs methods, causing sub-optimal segmentation. For
that, we propose a novel Dual-Perspective United Transformer (DPU-Former) with
a unique structure designed to simultaneously integrate long-range dependencies
and spatial details. In particular, we design the global-local mixed attention,
which captures diverse information through two perspectives and introduces a
Fourier-space merging strategy to obviate deviations for efficient fusion.
Furthermore, we present a gated linear feed-forward network to increase the
expressive ability. Additionally, we construct a DPU-Former decoder to
aggregate and strength features at different layers. Consequently, the
DPU-Former model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Robust and accurate 2D/3D registration, which aligns preoperative models with
intraoperative images of the same anatomy, is crucial for successful
interventional navigation. To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view
in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is
required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we
propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two
stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating
both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the
dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and
observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view
training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly
enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is
performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method
exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the
robustness of the registration process. The proposed framework achieves a mean
target registration error (mTRE) of $0.79 \pm 2.17$ mm on six specimens from
the DeepFluoro dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GAP的简单调整方法，解决了多模态大语言模型中视觉标记修剪导致的位置ID错位问题，显著恢复了模型的视觉定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理视觉标记时的高计算成本促使了标记修剪方法的发展，但修剪会显著削弱模型的定位能力。

Method: 提出Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP)，通过调整位置ID来恢复修剪后的模型性能。

Result: GAP将LLaVA在RefCOCO验证集上的准确率从修剪后的15.34%恢复到51.42%，接近原始性能的90%。

Conclusion: GAP方法无需额外训练或计算开销，能有效提升多种模型的修剪后性能。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
performance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface
for various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the
development of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs
associated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that
pruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to
incorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring
Expression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of
LLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis
identifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this
degradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for
maintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose
Grounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to
position IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the
original performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no
additional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such
as Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves
performance across various token pruning strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 银屑病严重程度评分在临床试验中很重要，但存在评分者间变异性和临床评估负担的问题。远程成像虽具扩展性，但受图像质量和标注不一致的影响。

Method: 使用基于梯度的可解释性方法，追踪误分类验证图像的梯度，检测训练样本中的不一致标注或非临床伪影。应用于ConvNeXT弱监督模型。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了远程评估的自动化评分鲁棒性，减少了对昂贵人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Psoriasis (PsO) severity scoring is important for clinical trials but is
hindered by inter-rater variability and the burden of in person clinical
evaluation. Remote imaging using patient captured mobile photos offers
scalability but introduces challenges, such as variation in lighting,
background, and device quality that are often imperceptible to humans but can
impact model performance. These factors, along with inconsistencies in
dermatologist annotations, reduce the reliability of automated severity
scoring. We propose a framework to automatically flag problematic training
images that introduce spurious correlations which degrade model generalization,
using a gradient based interpretability approach. By tracing the gradients of
misclassified validation images, we detect training samples where model errors
align with inconsistently rated examples or are affected by subtle, nonclinical
artifacts. We apply this method to a ConvNeXT based weakly supervised model
designed to classify PsO severity from phone images. Removing 8.2% of flagged
images improves model AUC-ROC by 5% (85% to 90%) on a held out test set.
Commonly, multiple annotators and an adjudication process ensure annotation
accuracy, which is expensive and time consuming. Our method detects training
images with annotation inconsistencies, potentially removing the need for
manual review. When applied to a subset of training data rated by two
dermatologists, the method identifies over 90% of cases with inter-rater
disagreement by reviewing only the top 30% of samples. This improves automated
scoring for remote assessments, ensuring robustness despite data collection
variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着点云数据的广泛应用，检测OOD点云对象对模型的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有研究对此问题探索不足。

Method: 利用3D视觉语言模型（3D VLMs）进行OOD检测，提出SODA方法，通过基于邻域的分数传播方案改进检测效果。

Result: SODA无需额外训练，在多种数据集和问题设置中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SODA有效解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的域偏移问题，提升了OOD点云检测的性能。

Abstract: As point cloud data increases in prevalence in a variety of applications, the
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) point cloud objects becomes
critical for ensuring model safety and reliability. However, this problem
remains under-explored in existing research. Inspired by success in the image
domain, we propose to exploit advances in 3D vision-language models (3D VLMs)
for OOD detection in point cloud objects. However, a major challenge is that
point cloud datasets used to pre-train 3D VLMs are drastically smaller in size
and object diversity than their image-based counterparts. Critically, they
often contain exclusively computer-designed synthetic objects. This leads to a
substantial domain shift when the model is transferred to practical tasks
involving real objects scanned from the physical environment. In this paper,
our empirical experiments show that synthetic-to-real domain shift
significantly degrades the alignment of point cloud with their associated text
embeddings in the 3D VLM latent space, hindering downstream performance. To
address this, we propose a novel methodology called SODA which improves the
detection of OOD point clouds through a neighborhood-based score propagation
scheme. SODA is inference-based, requires no additional model training, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing approaches across datasets
and problem settings.

Abstract: Recently the emergence of novel presentation attacks has drawn increasing
attention to face anti-spoofing. However, existing methods tend to memorize
data patterns from the training set, resulting in poor generalization to
unknown attack types across different scenarios and limited interpretability.
To address these challenges, this paper presents a reinforcement
fine-tuning-based face anti-spoofing method that stimulates the capabilities of
multimodal large language models to think and learn how to solve the
anti-spoofing task itself, rather than relying on the memorization of
authenticity patterns. We design verifiable class consistent reward and
reasoning consistent reward, and employ a GRPO-based optimization strategy to
guide the model in exploring reasoning policies from multiple perspectives to
maximize expected rewards. As a result, through iterative trial-and-error
learning while retaining only high-reward trajectories, the model distills
highly generalizable decision-making rules from the extensive solution space to
effectively address cross-domain face anti-spoofing tasks. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
cross-domain generalization performance. It generalizes well to diverse unknown
attack types in unseen target domains while providing interpretable reasoning
for its authenticity decisions without requiring labor-intensive textual
annotations for training.

Abstract: Video is transforming education with online courses and recorded lectures
supplementing and replacing classroom teaching. Recent research has focused on
enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation,
searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual
elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension,
retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential
for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is
that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is
challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs,
tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard
structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be
composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep
learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory
performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity
of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for
detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art
object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video
datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently
YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple
benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy.
Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general
solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper
contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video
frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: The automated reconstruction of the logical arrangement of tables from image
data, termed Table Structure Recognition (TSR), is fundamental for semantic
data extraction. Recently, researchers have explored a wide range of techniques
to tackle this problem, demonstrating significant progress. Each table is a set
of vertical and horizontal separators. Following this realization, we present
SepFormer, which integrates the split-and-merge paradigm into a single step
through separator regression with a DETR-style architecture, improving speed
and robustness. SepFormer is a coarse-to-fine approach that predicts table
separators from single-line to line-strip separators with a stack of two
transformer decoders. In the coarse-grained stage, the model learns to
gradually refine single-line segments through decoder layers with additional
angle loss. At the end of the fine-grained stage, the model predicts line-strip
separators by refining sampled points from each single-line segment. Our
SepFormer can run on average at 25.6 FPS while achieving comparable performance
with state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR,
PubTabNet, WTW, and iFLYTAB.

Abstract: Histological analysis plays a crucial role in understanding tissue structure
and pathology. While recent advancements in registration methods have improved
2D histological analysis, they often struggle to preserve critical 3D spatial
relationships, limiting their utility in both clinical and research
applications. Specifically, constructing accurate 3D models from 2D slices
remains challenging due to tissue deformation, sectioning artifacts,
variability in imaging techniques, and inconsistent illumination. Deep
learning-based registration methods have demonstrated improved performance but
suffer from limited generalizability and require large-scale training data. In
contrast, non-deep-learning approaches offer better generalizability but often
compromise on accuracy. In this study, we introduced ZeroReg3D, a novel
zero-shot registration pipeline tailored for accurate 3D reconstruction from
serial histological sections. By combining zero-shot deep learning-based
keypoint matching with optimization-based affine and non-rigid registration
techniques, ZeroReg3D effectively addresses critical challenges such as tissue
deformation, sectioning artifacts, staining variability, and inconsistent
illumination without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The code has been

Conclusion: SPAZER通过融合空间和语义推理，实现了高效的零样本3D视觉定位。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize target objects within a 3D scene
based on natural language queries. To alleviate the reliance on costly 3D
training data, recent studies have explored zero-shot 3DVG by leveraging the
extensive knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained LLMs and
VLMs. However, existing paradigms tend to emphasize either spatial (3D-based)
or semantic (2D-based) understanding, limiting their effectiveness in complex
real-world applications. In this work, we introduce SPAZER - a VLM-driven agent
that combines both modalities in a progressive reasoning framework. It first
holistically analyzes the scene and produces a 3D rendering from the optimal
viewpoint. Based on this, anchor-guided candidate screening is conducted to
perform a coarse-level localization of potential objects. Furthermore,
leveraging retrieved relevant 2D camera images, 3D-2D joint decision-making is
efficiently performed to determine the best-matching object. By bridging
spatial and semantic reasoning neural streams, SPAZER achieves robust zero-shot
grounding without training on 3D-labeled data. Extensive experiments on
ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate that SPAZER significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods, achieving notable gains of 9.0%
and 10.9% in accuracy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC) techniques, AI generated images (AIGIs) have attracted widespread
attention, among which AI generated omnidirectional images (AIGODIs) hold
significant potential for Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)
applications. AI generated omnidirectional images exhibit unique quality
issues, however, research on the quality assessment and optimization of
AI-generated omnidirectional images is still lacking. To this end, this work
first studies the quality assessment and distortion-aware saliency prediction
problems for AIGODIs, and further presents a corresponding optimization
process. Specifically, we first establish a comprehensive database to reflect
human feedback for AI-generated omnidirectionals, termed OHF2024, which
includes both subjective quality ratings evaluated from three perspectives and
distortion-aware salient regions. Based on the constructed OHF2024 database, we
propose two models with shared encoders based on the BLIP-2 model to evaluate
the human visual experience and predict distortion-aware saliency for
AI-generated omnidirectional images, which are named as BLIP2OIQA and
BLIP2OISal, respectively. Finally, based on the proposed models, we present an
automatic optimization process that utilizes the predicted visual experience
scores and distortion regions to further enhance the visual quality of an
AI-generated omnidirectional image. Extensive experiments show that our
BLIP2OIQA model and BLIP2OISal model achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in
the human visual experience evaluation task and the distortion-aware saliency
prediction task for AI generated omnidirectional images, and can be effectively
used in the optimization process. The database and codes will be released on

Conclusion: SDRNet能有效解决高分辨率遥感图像语义分割的挑战，具有竞争力。

Abstract: Land cover maps generated from semantic segmentation of high-resolution
remotely sensed images have drawn mucon in the photogrammetry and remote
sensing research community. Currently, massive fine-resolution remotely sensed
(FRRS) images acquired by improving sensing and imaging technologies become
available. However, accurate semantic segmentation of such FRRS images is
greatly affected by substantial class disparities, the invisibility of key
ground objects due to occlusion, and object size variation. Despite the
extraordinary potential in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in image
feature learning and representation, extracting sufficient features from FRRS
images for accurate semantic segmentation is still challenging. These
challenges demand the deep learning models to learn robust features and
generate sufficient feature descriptors. Specifically, learning
multi-contextual features to guarantee adequate coverage of varied object sizes
from the ground scene and harnessing global-local contexts to overcome class
disparities challenge even profound networks. Deeper networks significantly
lose spatial details due to gradual downsampling processes resulting in poor
segmentation results and coarse boundaries. This article presents a stacked
deep residual network (SDRNet) for semantic segmentation from FRRS images. The
proposed framework utilizes two stacked encoder-decoder networks to harness
long-range semantics yet preserve spatial information and dilated residual
blocks (DRB) between each encoder and decoder network to capture sufficient
global dependencies thus improving segmentation performance. Our experimental
results obtained using the ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate
that the SDRNet performs effectively and competitively against current DCNNs in
semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于掩码点建模的预训练方法依赖随机掩码策略，导致自监督模型难以捕捉合理的语义关系。

Method: 提出语义掩码自动编码器，包括原型语义建模模块和组件语义增强掩码策略，并引入语义增强提示调优策略。

Result: 在ScanObjectNN、ModelNet40和ShapeNetPart等数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义增强策略显著提升了点云理解的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud understanding aims to acquire robust and general feature
representations from unlabeled data. Masked point modeling-based methods have
recently shown significant performance across various downstream tasks. These
pre-training methods rely on random masking strategies to establish the
perception of point clouds by restoring corrupted point cloud inputs, which
leads to the failure of capturing reasonable semantic relationships by the
self-supervised models. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Masked
Autoencoder, which comprises two main components: a prototype-based component
semantic modeling module and a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy.
Specifically, in the component semantic modeling module, we design a component
semantic guidance mechanism to direct a set of learnable prototypes in
capturing the semantics of different components from objects. Leveraging these
prototypes, we develop a component semantic-enhanced masking strategy that
addresses the limitations of random masking in effectively covering complete
component structures. Furthermore, we introduce a component semantic-enhanced
prompt-tuning strategy, which further leverages these prototypes to improve the
performance of pre-trained models in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
conducted on datasets such as ScanObjectNN, ModelNet40, and ShapeNetPart
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TASeg框架，结合LoRA微调技术和动态特征融合模块，提升RGB-T语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RGB-T分割模型依赖低层视觉特征、缺乏高层文本信息的问题，以及SAM在多模态融合中的局限性。

Method: 采用LoRA微调技术，设计动态特征融合模块（DFFM）整合多模态视觉特征，并引入CLIP文本嵌入提升语义对齐。

Result: 在多样化数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景中，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: TASeg框架有效解决了RGB-T分割中的模态异质性和语义理解问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation of open environments is essential for
intelligent systems, yet significant problems remain: 1) Existing RGB-T
semantic segmentation models mainly rely on low-level visual features and lack
high-level textual information, which struggle with accurate segmentation when
categories share similar visual characteristics. 2) While SAM excels in
instance-level segmentation, integrating it with thermal images and text is
hindered by modality heterogeneity and computational inefficiency. To address
these, we propose TASeg, a text-aware RGB-T segmentation framework by using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning technology to adapt vision foundation
models. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Feature Fusion Module (DFFM) in the
image encoder, which effectively merges features from multiple visual
modalities while freezing SAM's original transformer blocks. Additionally, we
incorporate CLIP-generated text embeddings in the mask decoder to enable
semantic alignment, which further rectifies the classification error and
improves the semantic understanding accuracy. Experimental results across
diverse datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in
challenging scenarios with fewer trainable parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉单目标跟踪方法R1-Track，通过强化学习微调Qwen2.5-VL，解决了传统跟踪方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉单目标跟踪方法依赖大规模监督训练且缺乏灵活性，而MLLMs在基础任务中表现优异，但直接应用于跟踪任务效果不佳。

Method: 使用GRPO强化学习方法在小规模数据集上微调Qwen2.5-VL，生成模型R1-Track。

Result: R1-Track在GOT-10k基准测试中表现优异，支持灵活初始化并保留原模型通用能力。

Conclusion: R1-Track展示了MLLMs在视觉跟踪中的潜力，并提出了进一步改进的方向。

Abstract: Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the
scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in
the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching
problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters,
two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress
achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and
regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets,
and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent
years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly.
Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational
capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has
spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However,
experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between
image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned
Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement
learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The
resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k
benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text
descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities.
And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough
technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长时程视频生成的挑战，为机器人任务提供了高质量的模拟数据。

Abstract: We address the problem of generating long-horizon videos for robotic
manipulation tasks. Text-to-video diffusion models have made significant
progress in photorealism, language understanding, and motion generation but
struggle with long-horizon robotic tasks. Recent works use video diffusion
models for high-quality simulation data and predictive rollouts in robot
planning. However, these works predict short sequences of the robot achieving
one task and employ an autoregressive paradigm to extend to the long horizon,
leading to error accumulations in the generated video and in the execution. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel pipeline that bypasses the need
for autoregressive generation. We achieve this through a threefold
contribution: 1) we first decompose the high-level goals into smaller atomic
tasks and generate keyframes aligned with these instructions. A second
diffusion model then interpolates between each of the two generated frames,
achieving the long-horizon video. 2) We propose a semantics preserving
attention module to maintain consistency between the keyframes. 3) We design a
lightweight policy model to regress the robot joint states from generated
videos. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks in
video quality and consistency while outperforming previous policy models on
long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于指数力应用方案的修剪方法（ETP），显著提高了深度神经网络的压缩率，同时几乎不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度神经网络（DNNs）的复杂性和规模快速增长，导致计算成本和内存使用问题，需要高效的模型压缩技术。现有方法在修剪效果和准确性上存在不足。

Method: 提出指数扭矩修剪（ETP），采用指数力应用方案进行正则化，以更有效地修剪冗余模块。

Result: 实验表明，ETP在多个领域实现了比现有方法更高的压缩率，且准确性下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: ETP是一种简单高效的修剪方法，显著提升了模型压缩效果。

Abstract: The rapid growth in complexity and size of modern deep neural networks (DNNs)
has increased challenges related to computational costs and memory usage,
spurring a growing interest in efficient model compression techniques. Previous
state-of-the-art approach proposes using a Torque-inspired regularization which
forces the weights of neural modules around a selected pivot point. Whereas, we
observe that the pruning effect of this approach is far from perfect, as the
post-trained network is still dense and also suffers from high accuracy drop.
In this work, we attribute such ineffectiveness to the default linear force
application scheme, which imposes inappropriate force on neural module of
different distances. To efficiently prune the redundant and distant modules
while retaining those that are close and necessary for effective inference, in
this work, we propose Exponential Torque Pruning (ETP), which adopts an
exponential force application scheme for regularization. Experimental results
on a broad range of domains demonstrate that, though being extremely simple,
ETP manages to achieve significantly higher compression rate than the previous
state-of-the-art pruning strategies with negligible accuracy drop.

Motivation: 现有StyleGAN方法在面部风格化中存在伪影和内容保真度不足的问题，主要原因是忽略了生成器的语义偏移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成高保真、美观的面部风格化效果，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了风格化效果，还能实现灵活的多模态和参考引导风格化，无需复杂网络设计或额外训练。

Abstract: Facial stylization aims to transform facial images into appealing,
high-quality stylized portraits, with the critical challenge of accurately
learning the target style while maintaining content consistency with the
original image. Although previous StyleGAN-based methods have made significant
advancements, the generated results still suffer from artifacts or insufficient
fidelity to the source image. We argue that these issues stem from neglecting
semantic shift of the generator during stylization. Therefore, we propose a
facial stylization method that integrates semantic preservation constraint and
pseudo-paired supervision to enhance the content correspondence and improve the
stylization effect. Additionally, we develop a methodology for creating
multi-level pseudo-paired datasets to implement supervisory constraint.
Furthermore, building upon our facial stylization framework, we achieve more
flexible multimodal and reference-guided stylization without complex network
architecture designs or additional training. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach produces high-fidelity, aesthetically pleasing facial style
transfer that surpasses previous methods.

Conclusion: HOSS ReID数据集和TransOSS方法为船舶跟踪提供了更高效、全天候的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting and tracking ground objects using earth observation imagery remains
a significant challenge in the field of remote sensing. Continuous maritime
ship tracking is crucial for applications such as maritime search and rescue,
law enforcement, and shipping analysis. However, most current ship tracking
methods rely on geostationary satellites or video satellites. The former offer
low resolution and are susceptible to weather conditions, while the latter have
short filming durations and limited coverage areas, making them less suitable
for the real-world requirements of ship tracking. To address these limitations,
we present the Hybrid Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Ship
Re-Identification Dataset (HOSS ReID dataset), designed to evaluate the
effectiveness of ship tracking using low-Earth orbit constellations of optical
and SAR sensors. This approach ensures shorter re-imaging cycles and enables
all-weather tracking. HOSS ReID dataset includes images of the same ship
captured over extended periods under diverse conditions, using different
satellites of different modalities at varying times and angles. Furthermore, we
propose a baseline method for cross-modal ship re-identification, TransOSS,
which is built on the Vision Transformer architecture. It refines the patch
embedding structure to better accommodate cross-modal tasks, incorporates
additional embeddings to introduce more reference information, and employs
contrastive learning to pre-train on large-scale optical-SAR image pairs,
ensuring the model's ability to extract modality-invariant features. Our
dataset and baseline method are publicly available on
https://github.com/Alioth2000/Hoss-ReID.

TL;DR: Chimera-Seg和SGD方法解决了零样本语义分割中视觉语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示之间的语义差距问题，提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本语义分割（ZSS）需要从已知类别的监督中分割未知类别，但现有方法在视觉语言对齐和局部特征与全局表示的语义差距上存在挑战。

Method: 提出Chimera-Seg，结合分割主干和CLIP语义头；引入选择性全局蒸馏（SGD）和语义对齐模块（SAM）优化特征对齐。

Result: 在两个基准测试中，hIoU分别提升了0.9%和1.2%。

Conclusion: Chimera-Seg和SGD有效解决了ZSS中的关键挑战，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen
classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based
methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of
vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such
knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning
vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial
precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between
CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of
segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which
integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head
as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision
with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable
segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features
into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed
projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight
trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with
the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the
mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose
Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense
features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually
reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses.
Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense
visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text
encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in
hIoU.

Motivation: 现有基于重建和渲染的说话头部合成方法依赖身份特定模型，计算成本高且扩展性差。

Method: FIAG结合全局高斯场（支持多身份共享表示）和通用运动场（捕捉跨身份运动动态），实现快速身份适应。

Result: 实验表明，FIAG在效果和泛化性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIAG框架高效且通用，适用于多身份说话头部合成。

Abstract: Reconstruction and rendering-based talking head synthesis methods achieve
high-quality results with strong identity preservation but are limited by their
dependence on identity-specific models. Each new identity requires training
from scratch, incurring high computational costs and reduced scalability
compared to generative model-based approaches. To overcome this limitation, we
propose FIAG, a novel 3D speaking head synthesis framework that enables
efficient identity-specific adaptation using only a few training footage. FIAG
incorporates Global Gaussian Field, which supports the representation of
multiple identities within a shared field, and Universal Motion Field, which
captures the common motion dynamics across diverse identities. Benefiting from
the shared facial structure information encoded in the Global Gaussian Field
and the general motion priors learned in the motion field, our framework
enables rapid adaptation from canonical identity representations to specific
ones with minimal data. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches,
validating both the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed
framework. Code is available at: \textit{https://github.com/gme-hong/FIAG}.

Abstract: Linear measurements of the left ventricle (LV) in the Parasternal Long Axis
(PLAX) view using B-mode echocardiography are crucial for cardiac assessment.
These involve placing 4-6 landmarks along a virtual scanline (SL) perpendicular
to the LV axis near the mitral valve tips. Manual placement is time-consuming
and error-prone, while existing deep learning methods often misalign landmarks,
causing inaccurate measurements. We propose a novel framework that enhances LV
measurement accuracy by enforcing straight-line constraints. A landmark
detector is trained on Anatomical M-Mode (AMM) images, computed in real time
from B-mode videos, then transformed back to B-mode space. This approach
addresses misalignment and reduces measurement errors. Experiments show
improved accuracy over standard B-mode methods, and the framework generalizes
well across network architectures. Our semi-automatic design includes a
human-in-the-loop step where the user only places the SL, simplifying
interaction while preserving alignment flexibility and clinical relevance.

Conclusion: MirrorMe通过LTX模型和三项创新技术，实现了实时、高质量的音频驱动肖像动画生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation, which synthesizes realistic videos from
reference images using audio signals, faces significant challenges in real-time
generation of high-fidelity, temporally coherent animations. While recent
diffusion-based methods improve generation quality by integrating audio into
denoising processes, their reliance on frame-by-frame UNet architectures
introduces prohibitive latency and struggles with temporal consistency. This
paper introduces MirrorMe, a real-time, controllable framework built on the LTX
video model, a diffusion transformer that compresses video spatially and
temporally for efficient latent space denoising. To address LTX's trade-offs
between compression and semantic fidelity, we propose three innovations: 1. A
reference identity injection mechanism via VAE-encoded image concatenation and
self-attention, ensuring identity consistency; 2. A causal audio encoder and
adapter tailored to LTX's temporal structure, enabling precise audio-expression
synchronization; and 3. A progressive training strategy combining close-up
facial training, half-body synthesis with facial masking, and hand pose
integration for enhanced gesture control. Extensive experiments on the EMTD
Benchmark demonstrate MirrorMe's state-of-the-art performance in fidelity,
lip-sync accuracy, and temporal stability.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for estimating the relative pose between rolling
shutter cameras using the intersections of line projections with a single
scanline per image. This allows pose estimation without explicitly modeling
camera motion. Alternatively, scanlines can be selected within a single image,
enabling single-view relative pose estimation for scanlines of rolling shutter
cameras. Our approach is designed as a foundational building block for rolling
shutter structure-from-motion (SfM), where no motion model is required, and
each scanline's pose can be computed independently. % We classify minimal
solvers for this problem in both generic and specialized settings, including
cases with parallel lines and known gravity direction, assuming known
intrinsics and no lens distortion. Furthermore, we develop minimal solvers for
the parallel-lines scenario, both with and without gravity priors, by
leveraging connections between this problem and the estimation of 2D structure
from 1D cameras. % Experiments on rolling shutter images from the Fastec
dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our approach for initializing rolling
shutter SfM, highlighting its potential for further development. % The code
will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Reasoning is a hallmark of human intelligence, enabling adaptive
decision-making in complex and unfamiliar scenarios. In contrast, machine
intelligence remains bound to training data, lacking the ability to dynamically
refine solutions at inference time. While some recent advances have explored
reasoning in machines, these efforts are largely limited to verbal domains such
as mathematical problem-solving, where explicit rules govern step-by-step
reasoning. Other critical real-world tasks - including visual perception,
spatial reasoning, and radiological diagnosis - require non-verbal reasoning,
which remains an open challenge. Here we present a novel learning paradigm that
enables machine reasoning in vision by allowing performance improvement with
increasing thinking time (inference-time compute), even under conditions where
labelled data is very limited. Inspired by dual-process theories of human
cognition in psychology, our approach integrates a fast-thinking System I
module for familiar tasks, with a slow-thinking System II module that
iteratively refines solutions using self-play reinforcement learning. This
paradigm mimics human reasoning by proposing, competing over, and refining
solutions in data-scarce scenarios. We demonstrate superior performance through
extended thinking time, compared not only to large-scale supervised learning
but also foundation models and even human experts, in real-world vision tasks.
These tasks include computer-vision benchmarks and cancer localisation on
medical images across five organs, showcasing transformative potential for
non-verbal machine reasoning.

Result: 在四个rPPG基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法不仅能准确测量超短视频片段的心率，还优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在超短视频片段的心率测量中表现出色，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds
but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In
this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video
clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the
limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an
effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent
periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their
much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due
to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer
rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency
to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG
estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only
accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform
previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The realistic reconstruction of street scenes is critical for developing
real-world simulators in autonomous driving. Most existing methods rely on
object pose annotations, using these poses to reconstruct dynamic objects and
move them during the rendering process. This dependence on high-precision
object annotations limits large-scale and extensive scene reconstruction. To
address this challenge, we propose B\'ezier curve Gaussian splatting
(B\'ezierGS), which represents the motion trajectories of dynamic objects using
learnable B\'ezier curves. This approach fully leverages the temporal
information of dynamic objects and, through learnable curve modeling,
automatically corrects pose errors. By introducing additional supervision on
dynamic object rendering and inter-curve consistency constraints, we achieve
reasonable and accurate separation and reconstruction of scene elements.
Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuPlan benchmark
demonstrate that B\'ezierGS outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in both
dynamic and static scene components reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Result: TPM在多原型和多类分割中表现更优，分割精度显著提升。

Conclusion: TPM为医学图像少样本分割提供了新的视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: Common prototype-based medical image few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods
model foreground and background classes using class-specific prototypes.
However, given the high variability of the background, a more promising
direction is to focus solely on foreground modeling, treating the background as
an anomaly -- an approach introduced by ADNet. Yet, ADNet faces three key
limitations: dependence on a single prototype per class, a focus on binary
classification, and fixed thresholds that fail to adapt to patient and organ
variability. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Tied Prototype Model
(TPM), a principled reformulation of ADNet with tied prototype locations for
foreground and background distributions. Building on its probabilistic
foundation, TPM naturally extends to multiple prototypes and multi-class
segmentation while effectively separating non-typical background features.
Notably, both extensions lead to improved segmentation accuracy. Finally, we
leverage naturally occurring class priors to define an ideal target for
adaptive thresholds, boosting segmentation performance. Taken together, TPM
provides a fresh perspective on prototype-based FSS for medical image
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/hjk92g/TPM-FSS.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in autonomous driving, accurately predicting
pedestrian behavior has become essential for ensuring safety in complex and
unpredictable traffic conditions. The growing interest in this challenge
highlights the need for comprehensive datasets that capture unstructured
environments, enabling the development of more robust prediction models to
enhance pedestrian safety and vehicle navigation. In this paper, we introduce
an Indian driving pedestrian dataset designed to address the complexities of
modeling pedestrian behavior in unstructured environments, such as illumination
changes, occlusion of pedestrians, unsignalized scene types and
vehicle-pedestrian interactions. The dataset provides high-level and detailed
low-level comprehensive annotations focused on pedestrians requiring the
ego-vehicle's attention. Evaluation of the state-of-the-art intention
prediction methods on our dataset shows a significant performance drop of up to
$\mathbf{15\%}$, while trajectory prediction methods underperform with an
increase of up to $\mathbf{1208}$ MSE, defeating standard pedestrian datasets.
Additionally, we present exhaustive quantitative and qualitative analysis of
intention and trajectory baselines. We believe that our dataset will open new
challenges for the pedestrian behavior research community to build robust
models. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法自动化了管道重建，降低了成本，支持数字孪生的快速精确建模。

Abstract: Accurate digital twins of industrial assets, such as ships and offshore
platforms, rely on the precise reconstruction of complex pipe networks.
However, manual modelling of pipes from laser scan data is a time-consuming and
labor-intensive process. This paper presents a pipeline for automated pipe
reconstruction from incomplete laser scan data. The approach estimates a
skeleton curve using Laplacian-based contraction, followed by curve elongation.
The skeleton axis is then recentred using a rolling sphere technique combined
with 2D circle fitting, and refined with a 3D smoothing step. This enables the
determination of pipe properties, including radius, length and orientation, and
facilitates the creation of detailed 3D models of complex pipe networks. By
automating pipe reconstruction, this approach supports the development of
digital twins, allowing for rapid and accurate modeling while reducing costs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有张量分解方法（如Tucker和CP）在灵活性和可解释性之间存在权衡，且稀疏解难以获得。CP-INR旨在结合CP分解的天然结构优势，同时解决稀疏性和平滑性问题。

Method: 利用神经网络参数化CP分解，提出变分形式的Schatten-p拟范数实现稀疏性，并基于雅可比矩阵谱范数提出平滑性正则化方法。

Result: 在多维数据恢复任务（如图像修复、去噪和点云上采样）中，CP-INR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CP-INR结合了CP分解的天然结构和神经网络的非线性能力，为连续数据表示提供了高效且理论保障的解决方案。

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data,
such as color images and videos. Low-rank tensor representation has become
essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like
Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. In
contrast, while the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a more
natural and interpretable tensor structure, obtaining sparse solutions remains
challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a
CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks for implicit
neural representation (CP-INR). This approach enables continuous data
representation beyond structured grids, fully exploiting the non-linearity of
tensor data with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve a
sparse CP decomposition, we introduce a variational form of the Schatten-p
quasi-norm and prove its relationship to multilinear rank minimization. For
smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the
Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. Our proposed smoothness
regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can
serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image
denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to continuous data. Extensive
experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image
inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority
and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有视频-LLMs采用均匀帧采样，难以有效捕捉视频中与查询相关的关键时空线索。

Method: Q-Frame通过基于文本-图像匹配网络（如CLIP）的无训练即插即用策略，利用Gumbel-Max技巧实现高效帧选择。

Result: 实验表明，Q-Frame在MLVU、LongVideoBench和Video-MME等基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Q-Frame能够在不增加计算负担的情况下处理更多帧，保留关键时空信息，适用于多种视频理解任务。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
success in visual understanding tasks. However, challenges persist in adapting
these models for video comprehension due to the large volume of data and
temporal complexity. Existing Video-LLMs using uniform frame sampling often
struggle to capture the query-related crucial spatiotemporal clues of videos
effectively. In this paper, we introduce Q-Frame, a novel approach for adaptive
frame selection and multi-resolution scaling tailored to the video's content
and the specific query. Q-Frame employs a training-free, plug-and-play strategy
generated by a text-image matching network like CLIP, utilizing the Gumbel-Max
trick for efficient frame selection. Q-Frame allows Video-LLMs to process more
frames without exceeding computational limits, thereby preserving critical
temporal and spatial information. We demonstrate Q-Frame's effectiveness
through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MLVU,
LongVideoBench, and Video-MME, illustrating its superiority over existing
methods and its applicability across various video understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理中存在绑定问题，即难以可靠地将感知特征与正确的视觉对象关联，导致计数、视觉搜索等任务表现不佳。

Method: 通过为视觉输入添加低层空间结构（如水平线），并配合鼓励顺序、空间感知解析的文本提示，改进模型表现。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在视觉搜索、计数、场景描述和空间关系任务中分别提升了25.00%、26.83%、0.32编辑距离误差和9.50%的准确率。

Conclusion: 低层视觉结构是提升视觉语言模型在空间任务中表现的有效且未被充分探索的方向，优于纯语言策略。

Abstract: Despite progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their capacity for visual
reasoning is often limited by the \textit{binding problem}: the failure to
reliably associate perceptual features with their correct visual referents.
This limitation underlies persistent errors in tasks such as counting, visual
search, scene description, and spatial relationship understanding. A key factor
is that current VLMs process visual features largely in parallel, lacking
mechanisms for spatially grounded, serial attention. This paper introduces a
simple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level
spatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual
prompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically
demonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning
tasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by
25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in
scene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship
tasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the
visual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,
including Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade
performance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,
underscoring the importance of visual input design over purely
linguistically-based approaches. These findings suggest that low-level visual
structuring is a powerful and underexplored direction for improving
compositional visual reasoning and could serve as a general strategy for
enhancing VLM performance on spatially grounded tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于OCT图像的自监督学习基础模型缺乏对图像的全面语义理解，导致下游任务性能不足，尤其是复杂任务，且依赖监督微调。

Method: 提出RetFiner，结合多种训练目标，利用文本数据的监督信号，改进基础模型的表示能力。

Result: 在七种OCT分类任务中，RetFiner显著提升了RETFound、UrFound和VisionFM的线性探测性能，平均分别提高5.8、3.9和2.1个百分点。

Conclusion: RetFiner能够高效改进基础模型，提升下游任务性能，且无需监督微调，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The rise of imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled clinicians and researchers to
streamline retinal disease staging. A popular DL approach is self-supervised
learning (SSL), where models learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data,
avoiding costly annotation. SSL has allowed the development of foundation
models (FMs), large models that can be used for a variety of downstream tasks.
However, existing FMs for OCT, trained solely on image data, lack a
comprehensive and robust semantic understanding of images, as evidenced by
their downstream performance (especially for complex tasks), and thus require
supervised fine-tuning (which may be unfeasible) to better adapt to specific
applications and populations. To address this, we propose RetFiner, an SSL
vision-language refinement scheme that improves the representations of existing
FMs and enables their efficient and direct adaptation to specific populations
for improved downstream performance. Our method uses a diverse set of training
objectives which take advantage of the rich supervisory signal found in textual
data. We tested RetFiner on the retinal FMs RETFound, UrFound, and VisionFM,
showing significant improvements in linear probing performance on seven highly
diverse OCT classification tasks, with an average increase of 5.8, 3.9, and 2.1
percentage points over their baselines, respectively. Our code and model
weights are publicly available at https://github.com/ronnief1/RetFiner.

Method: UOFS将特征空间解耦为幅度（目标识别）和角度（分类）两部分，并提出HBO策略优化背景和角度分布。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基于纠缠特征空间的现有方法。

Conclusion: UOFS框架通过解耦和优化策略，有效提升了Few-shot目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples
for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing
FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle
objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature
spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria
and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this
limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization
framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal
components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes
classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness
knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the
disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set
images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between
potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization
depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of
angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose
a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure
background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to
provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating
unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular
optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a
Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address
task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based
on entangled feature spaces.

Result: 在基准测试中验证了频率增强语义特征能有效区分视觉和语义相似的动作簇。

Conclusion: FS-VAE通过频率分解和语义对齐显著提升了零样本动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement presents two primary challenges: 1) Significant
variations in low-light images across different conditions, and 2) Enhancement
levels influenced by subjective preferences and user intent. To address these
issues, we propose ReF-LLE, a novel personalized low-light image enhancement
method that operates in the Fourier frequency domain and incorporates deep
reinforcement learning. ReF-LLE is the first to integrate deep reinforcement
learning into this domain. During training, a zero-reference image evaluation
strategy is introduced to score enhanced images, providing reward signals that
guide the model to handle varying degrees of low-light conditions effectively.
In the inference phase, ReF-LLE employs a personalized adaptive iterative
strategy, guided by the zero-frequency component in the Fourier domain, which
represents the overall illumination level. This strategy enables the model to
adaptively adjust low-light images to align with the illumination distribution
of a user-provided reference image, ensuring personalized enhancement results.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReF-LLE
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior perceptual quality and
adaptability in personalized low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Understanding the impact of small quantum gate perturbations, which are
common in quantum digital devices but absent in classical computers, is crucial
for identifying potential advantages in quantum machine learning. While these
perturbations are typically seen as detrimental to quantum computation, they
can actually enhance performance by serving as a natural source of data
augmentation. Additionally, they can often be efficiently simulated on
classical hardware, enabling quantum-inspired approaches to improve classical
machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate random Bloch sphere
rotations, which are fundamental SU(2) transformations, as a simple yet
effective quantum-inspired data augmentation technique. Unlike conventional
augmentations such as flipping, rotating, or cropping, quantum transformations
lack intuitive spatial interpretations, making their application to tasks like
image classification less straightforward. While common quantum augmentation
methods rely on applying quantum models or trainable quanvolutional layers to
classical datasets, we focus on the direct application of small-angle Bloch
rotations and their effect on classical data. Using the large-scale ImageNet
dataset, we demonstrate that our quantum-inspired augmentation method improves
image classification performance, increasing Top-1 accuracy by 3%, Top-5
accuracy by 2.5%, and the F$_1$ score from 8% to 12% compared to standard
classical augmentation methods. Finally, we examine the use of stronger unitary
augmentations. Although these transformations preserve information in
principle, they result in visually unrecognizable images with potential
applications for privacy computations. However, we show that our augmentation
approach and simple SU(2) transformations do not enhance differential privacy
and discuss the implications of this limitation.

Conclusion: 4D-VLA通过整合4D信息和优化采样策略，有效解决了预训练中的混乱问题，提升了模型的时空推理能力和适应性。

Abstract: Leveraging diverse robotic data for pretraining remains a critical challenge.
Existing methods typically model the dataset's action distribution using simple
observations as inputs. However, these inputs are often incomplete, resulting
in a dispersed conditional action distribution-an issue we refer to as
coordinate system chaos and state chaos. This inconsistency significantly
hampers pretraining efficiency. To address this, we propose 4D-VLA, a novel
approach that effectively integrates 4D information into the input to mitigate
these sources of chaos. Our model introduces depth and temporal information
into visual features with sequential RGB-D inputs, aligning the coordinate
systems of the robot and the scene. This alignment endows the model with strong
spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities while minimizing training overhead.
Additionally, we introduce memory bank sampling, a frame sampling strategy
designed to extract informative frames from historical images, further
improving effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that
our pretraining method and architectural components substantially enhance model
performance. In both simulated and real-world experiments, our model achieves a
significant increase in success rate over OpenVLA. To further assess spatial
perception and generalization to novel views, we introduce MV-Bench, a
multi-view simulation benchmark. Our model consistently outperforms existing
methods, demonstrating stronger spatial understanding and adaptability.

Conclusion: EAMamba有效解决了Vision Mamba的局限性，为图像恢复任务提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration is a key task in low-level computer vision that aims to
reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs. The emergence of Vision
Mamba, which draws inspiration from the advanced state space model Mamba, marks
a significant advancement in this field. Vision Mamba demonstrates excellence
in modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, a crucial advantage
for image restoration tasks. Despite its strengths, Vision Mamba encounters
challenges in low-level vision tasks, including computational complexity that
scales with the number of scanning sequences and local pixel forgetting. To
address these limitations, this study introduces Efficient All-Around Mamba
(EAMamba), an enhanced framework that incorporates a Multi-Head Selective Scan
Module (MHSSM) with an all-around scanning mechanism. MHSSM efficiently
aggregates multiple scanning sequences, which avoids increases in computational
complexity and parameter count. The all-around scanning strategy implements
multiple patterns to capture holistic information and resolves the local pixel
forgetting issue. Our experimental evaluations validate these innovations
across several restoration tasks, including super resolution, denoising,
deblurring, and dehazing. The results validate that EAMamba achieves a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能够像人类一样利用场景上下文生成物体参考，以及在不同条件下如何依赖上下文。

Method: 引入COOCO数据集，测试模型在不同场景-物体一致性和噪声下的表现，并通过注意力分析模型行为。

Result: 模型会自适应地利用场景上下文，尤其在目标与场景高度一致或物体信息退化时。注意力分析显示，成功的物体分类涉及中层对目标的更多关注。

Conclusion: VLMs能够动态平衡局部和上下文信息进行物体参考生成，COOCO数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Natural scenes provide us with rich contexts for object recognition and
reference. In particular, knowing what type of scene one is looking at
generates expectations about which objects will occur, and what their spatial
configuration should be. Do Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn to rely on
scene contexts in a similar way, when generating references to objects? To
address this question, we introduce the \textit{Common Objects Out-of-Context
(COOCO)} dataset and test to what extent VLMs rely on scene context to refer to
objects under different degrees of scene-object congruency, and different
perturbations. Our findings show that models leverage scene context adaptively,
depending on both the semantic relatedness between object and scene and the
level of noise. In particular, models rely more on context under high
target-scene congruence or when objects are degraded. Attention analysis
reveals that successful object categorisation involves increased focus on the
target in mid-level layers, especially under moderate noise, suggesting that
VLMs dynamically balance local and contextual information for reference
generation. We make our dataset, code and models available at

Result: 在多样化基准测试中表现优于现有方法，保持了高性能。

Conclusion: VisionDrop简单有效，提升了计算效率且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences
of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens
often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to
substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in
practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to
or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction
approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that
textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this
work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms
of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of
text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a
training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual
tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on
textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,
we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a
progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and
lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual
information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive
experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent
improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or
complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient
inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.

Result: RoomCraft在生成真实、语义连贯且视觉吸引人的房间布局方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RoomCraft通过多阶段优化和冲突感知策略，有效解决了复杂多约束场景下的3D室内场景生成问题。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频外绘任务中难以同时保证时空一致性和生成内容的高质量，扩散变换器（DiTs）因其优越性能成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 提出OutDreamer框架，包含高效视频控制分支和条件外绘分支，引入掩码驱动自注意力层和潜在对齐损失，并采用跨视频片段细化器处理长视频。

Result: 在广泛认可的基准测试中，OutDreamer在零样本设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OutDreamer通过创新设计和优化策略，显著提升了视频外绘任务的性能，展示了DiTs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Video outpainting is a challenging task that generates new video content by
extending beyond the boundaries of an original input video, requiring both
temporal and spatial consistency. Many state-of-the-art methods utilize latent
diffusion models with U-Net backbones but still struggle to achieve high
quality and adaptability in generated content. Diffusion transformers (DiTs)
have emerged as a promising alternative because of their superior performance.
We introduce OutDreamer, a DiT-based video outpainting framework comprising two
main components: an efficient video control branch and a conditional
outpainting branch. The efficient video control branch effectively extracts
masked video information, while the conditional outpainting branch generates
missing content based on these extracted conditions. Additionally, we propose a
mask-driven self-attention layer that dynamically integrates the given mask
information, further enhancing the model's adaptability to outpainting tasks.
Furthermore, we introduce a latent alignment loss to maintain overall
consistency both within and between frames. For long video outpainting, we
employ a cross-video-clip refiner to iteratively generate missing content,
ensuring temporal consistency across video clips. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our zero-shot OutDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods on widely recognized benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨设备使用不同稀疏特征提取算法时表现不佳，主要因为假设使用相同检测器，而实际中不同描述符通常对应不同检测器。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法显著提升了图像匹配和视觉定位的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨检测器特征匹配提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了实际应用中的性能。

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods fail to solve visual localization in scenarios where
different devices use different sparse feature extraction algorithms to obtain
keypoints and their corresponding descriptors. Translating feature descriptors
is enough to enable matching. However, performance is drastically reduced in
cross-feature detector cases, because current solutions assume common
keypoints. This means that the same detector has to be used, which is rarely
the case in practice when different descriptors are used. The low repeatability
of keypoints, in addition to non-discriminatory and non-distinctive
descriptors, make the identification of true correspondences extremely
challenging. We present the first method tackling this problem, which performs
feature descriptor augmentation targeting cross-detector feature matching, and
then feature translation to a latent space. We show that our method
significantly improves image matching and visual localization in the
cross-feature scenario and evaluate the proposed method on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Building damage identification shortly after a disaster is crucial for
guiding emergency response and recovery efforts. Although optical satellite
imagery is commonly used for disaster mapping, its effectiveness is often
hampered by cloud cover or the absence of pre-event acquisitions. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce a novel multimodal deep learning (DL) framework
for detecting building damage using single-date very high resolution (VHR)
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from the Italian Space Agency (ASI)
COSMO SkyMed (CSK) constellation, complemented by auxiliary geospatial data.
Our method integrates SAR image patches, OpenStreetMap (OSM) building
footprints, digital surface model (DSM) data, and structural and exposure
attributes from the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) to improve detection accuracy
and contextual interpretation. Unlike existing approaches that depend on pre
and post event imagery, our model utilizes only post event data, facilitating
rapid deployment in critical scenarios. The framework effectiveness is
demonstrated using a new dataset from the 2023 earthquake in Turkey, covering
multiple cities with diverse urban settings. Results highlight that
incorporating geospatial features significantly enhances detection performance
and generalizability to previously unseen areas. By combining SAR imagery with
detailed vulnerability and exposure information, our approach provides reliable
and rapid building damage assessments without the dependency from available
pre-event data. Moreover, the automated and scalable data generation process
ensures the framework's applicability across diverse disaster-affected regions,
underscoring its potential to support effective disaster management and
recovery efforts. Code and data will be made available upon acceptance of the
paper.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了性能下降问题，适用于主流生物识别模态。

Abstract: This paper analyses and addresses the performance gap in the fuzzy
vault-based \ac{BCS}. We identify unstable error correction capabilities, which
are caused by variable feature set sizes and their influence on similarity
thresholds, as a key source of performance degradation. This issue is further
compounded by information loss introduced through feature type transformations.
To address both problems, we propose a novel feature quantization method based
on \it{equal frequent intervals}. This method guarantees fixed feature set
sizes and supports training-free adaptation to any number of intervals. The
proposed approach significantly reduces the performance gap introduced by
template protection. Additionally, it integrates seamlessly with existing
systems to minimize the negative effects of feature transformation. Experiments
on state-of-the-art face, fingerprint, and iris recognition systems confirm
that only minimal performance degradation remains, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the method across major biometric modalities.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of the two most relevant computer
vision deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Network and Vision
Transformer, for event-based cameras. These cameras capture scene changes,
unlike traditional frame-based cameras with capture static images, and are
particularly suited for dynamic environments such as UAVs and autonomous
vehicles. The deep learning models studied in this work are ResNet34 and ViT
B16, fine-tuned on the GEN1 event-based dataset. The research evaluates and
compares these models under both standard conditions and in the presence of
simulated noise. Initial evaluations on the clean GEN1 dataset reveal that
ResNet34 and ViT B16 achieve accuracies of 88% and 86%, respectively, with
ResNet34 showing a slight advantage in classification accuracy. However, the
ViT B16 model demonstrates notable robustness, particularly given its
pre-training on a smaller dataset. Although this study focuses on ground-based
vehicle classification, the methodologies and findings hold significant promise
for adaptation to UAV contexts, including aerial object classification and
event-based vision systems for aviation-related tasks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in 3D point cloud data remains a
challenge, particularly in applications where safe and robust perception is
critical. While existing OOD detection methods have shown progress for 2D image

structure to enhancing the effectiveness of VLMs for 3D OOD detection. We
propose a novel Graph Score Propagation (GSP) method that incorporates prompt

practical applications. We demonstrate that GSP consistently outperforms

Conclusion: DVidE任务及相关方法有效增强了视频大模型在动态推理中的表现，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in
understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive
reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information
emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context
can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce
Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think
like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence.
In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine
whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification
version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment
relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we
propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual
reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce
inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines
ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually
relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals.
Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with
strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric
specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental
results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method
in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态学习的推理时适应提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
wide range of multimodal tasks, yet they often exhibit inconsistent behavior
when faced with semantically equivalent inputs, undermining their reliability
and robustness. Recent benchmarks, such as MM-R3, highlight that even
state-of-the-art VLMs can produce divergent predictions across semantically
equivalent inputs, despite maintaining high average accuracy. Prior work
addresses this issue by modifying model architectures or conducting large-scale
fine-tuning on curated datasets. In contrast, we propose a simple and effective
test-time consistency framework that enhances semantic consistency without
supervised re-training. Our method is entirely post-hoc, model-agnostic, and
applicable to any VLM with access to its weights. Given a single test point, we
enforce consistent predictions via two complementary objectives: (i) a
Cross-Entropy Agreement Loss that aligns predictive distributions across
semantically equivalent inputs, and (ii) a Pseudo-Label Consistency Loss that
draws outputs toward a self-averaged consensus. Our method is plug-and-play and
leverages information from a single test input itself to improve consistency.
Experiments on the MM-R3 benchmark show that our framework yields substantial
gains in consistency across state-of-the-art models, establishing a new
direction for inference-time adaptation in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative modeling have unlocked unprecedented
opportunities for video synthesis. In real-world applications, however, users
often seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with
precise and consistent control. Despite the progress achieved by existing
methods, ensuring fine-grained alignment with user intentions remains an open
and challenging problem. In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel
framework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video
editing. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the
input video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be
performed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To
simplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that
allows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits
are then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D
meshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce
the edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a
decoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework
supports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the
video frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture
modification, and object composition. Our approach marks a key step toward
high-quality, controllable video editing workflows. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce WarpRF, a training-free general-purpose framework for
quantifying the uncertainty of radiance fields. Built upon the assumption that
photometric and geometric consistency should hold among images rendered by an
accurate model, WarpRF quantifies its underlying uncertainty from an unseen
point of view by leveraging backward warping across viewpoints, projecting
reliable renderings to the unseen viewpoint and measuring the consistency with
images rendered there. WarpRF is simple and inexpensive, does not require any
training, and can be applied to any radiance field implementation for free.
WarpRF excels at both uncertainty quantification and downstream tasks, e.g.,
active view selection and active mapping, outperforming any existing method
tailored to specific frameworks.

Abstract: This work explores enabling Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to link visual
cues across multiple images. A straightforward solution is to adapt rule-based
reinforcement learning for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, such methods
typically rely on manually curated question-answer pairs, which can be
particularly challenging when dealing with fine grained visual details and
complex logic across images. Inspired by self-supervised visual representation
learning, we observe that images contain inherent constraints that can serve as
supervision. Based on this insight, we construct image triplets comprising two
augmented views of the same image and a third, similar but distinct image.
During training, the model is prompted to generate a reasoning process to
compare these images (i.e., determine same or different). Then we optimize the
model with rule-based reinforcement learning. Due to the high visual similarity
and the presence of augmentations, the model must attend to subtle visual
changes and perform logical reasoning to succeed. Experiments show that,
although trained solely on visual comparison tasks, the learned reasoning
ability generalizes effectively to a wide range of questions. Without relying
on any human-annotated question-answer pairs, our method achieves significant
improvements on multi-image reasoning benchmarks and shows strong performance
on general vision tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse
data, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement
learning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.
Common issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation
of overly detailed or "overthinking" reasoning. Our work investigates how the
KL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric
Policy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled
responses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,
Difficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically
adjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents
policy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes
samples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative
samples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to
penalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages
more concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We
apply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B. View-R1-3B
significantly enhances reasoning capabilities, showing an average 7\% gain over
the base model and outperforming larger MLLMs (7-11B) on various reasoning
benchmarks. Importantly, unlike other reasoning-tuned MLLMs that often degrade
on general tasks, View-R1-3B maintains consistent improvement, demonstrating
superior generalization. These results highlight the effectiveness and broad
applicability of our DADS and STCR techniques for advancing complex multimodal
reasoning in MLLMs. The code will be made available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SceneDiffuser++的端到端生成世界模型，用于城市规模的交通模拟，整合了场景生成、动态代理行为建模等多项技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过模拟城市交通场景，补充有限的真实驾驶里程数据，用于自动驾驶软件的测试和验证。

Method: 开发了SceneDiffuser++模型，采用单一损失函数训练，整合了场景生成、动态代理行为建模、遮挡推理等技术。

Result: 在扩展版的Waymo Open Motion Dataset上验证了模型的城市规模模拟能力，展示了其在长时间模拟条件下的高真实感。

Conclusion: SceneDiffuser++为城市规模交通模拟提供了一种高效且真实的解决方案，填补了动态场景生成和环境模拟等领域的研究空白。

Abstract: The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.

Result: 在表格域中，算法快速可靠地收敛到最优风险规避值函数。

Conclusion: 该算法为风险规避MDP提供了一种有效的无模型解决方案。

Abstract: Risk-averse total-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) offer a promising
framework for modeling and solving undiscounted infinite-horizon objectives.
Existing model-based algorithms for risk measures like the entropic risk
measure (ERM) and entropic value-at-risk (EVaR) are effective in small
problems, but require full access to transition probabilities. We propose a
Q-learning algorithm to compute the optimal stationary policy for total-reward
ERM and EVaR objectives with strong convergence and performance guarantees. The
algorithm and its optimality are made possible by ERM's dynamic consistency and
elicitability. Our numerical results on tabular domains demonstrate quick and
reliable convergence of the proposed Q-learning algorithm to the optimal
risk-averse value function.

Motivation: 探索LLM和智能系统在药物发现中的模块化潜力，填补该领域研究空白。

Method: 比较不同LLM（如Claude、GPT-4o、Llama等）和代理类型（工具调用与代码生成）的性能，使用LLM作为评判标准。

Result: Claude-3.5-Sonnet、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和GPT-4o表现优于其他模型；代码生成代理通常更优，但结果因问题和模型而异。

Conclusion: LLM模块化需结合提示工程，未来需进一步研究以实现稳定、可扩展的智能系统解决方案。

Abstract: Large-language models (LLMs) and agentic systems present exciting
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery and design. In this study, we
critically examine the modularity of LLM-based agentic systems for drug
discovery, i.e., whether parts of the agentic system such as the LLM are
interchangeable, a topic that has received limited attention in drug discovery
applications. We compare the performance of different large language models
(LLMs) and the effectiveness of tool-calling agents versus code-generating
agents in this domain. Our case study, comparing performance in orchestrating
tools for chemistry and drug discovery using an LLM-as-a-judge score, shows
that Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o outperform alternative
language models such as Llama-3.1-8B, Llama-3.1-70B, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and
Nova-Micro. Although we confirm that code-generating agents outperform the
tool-calling ones on average, we show that this is highly question and model
dependent. Furthermore, the impact of replacing system prompts is dependent on
the specific question asked and the model used, underscoring that -- even in
this particular domain -- one cannot just replace language models without
considering prompt re-engineering. Our study highlights the necessity of
further research into the modularity of agentic systems to enable the
development of stable and scalable solutions for real-world problems.

Result: 在多个高维大规模任务（NLP、音频、计算机视觉）中验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本研究不仅改进了密度聚类的参数控制，还深化了对参数间关系的理解。

Abstract: Density-based clustering methods often surpass centroid-based counterparts,
when addressing data with noise or arbitrary data distributions common in
real-world problems. In this study, we reveal a key property intrinsic to
density-based clustering methods regarding the relation between the number of
clusters and the neighborhood radius of core points - we empirically show that
it is nearly unimodal, and support this claim theoretically in a specific
setting. We leverage this property to devise new strategies for finding
appropriate values for the radius more efficiently based on the Ternary Search
algorithm. This is especially important for large scale data that is
high-dimensional, where parameter tuning is computationally intensive. We
validate our methodology through extensive applications across a range of
high-dimensional, large-scale NLP, Audio, and Computer Vision tasks,
demonstrating its practical effectiveness and robustness. This work not only
offers a significant advancement in parameter control for density-based
clustering but also broadens the understanding regarding the relations between
their guiding parameters. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态控制质量-复杂度权衡的方法，通过调整时间步长和神经网络长度，优化连续归一化流和扩散模型的采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要减少采样时间步长以提高效率，但忽略了神经网络长度的影响。本文探索了动态调整时间步长和网络长度的互补方向。

Method: 通过重连Transformer架构中的块来解决内部离散ODE，并在训练中引入时间和长度一致性项，实现任意时间步长和块数的采样。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上的实验表明，最高效采样模式下延迟减少3倍，高质量采样时FID分数提升3.5分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时间和长度维度上均具有灵活性，显著降低了延迟和内存使用，同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Recently, continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) and diffusion models (DMs) have
been studied using the unified theoretical framework. Although such models can
generate high-quality data points from a noise distribution, the sampling
demands multiple iterations to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE)
with high computational complexity. Most existing methods focus on reducing the
number of time steps during the sampling process to improve efficiency. In this
work, we explore a complementary direction in which the quality-complexity
tradeoff can be dynamically controlled in terms of time steps and in the length
of the neural network. We achieve this by rewiring the blocks in the
transformer-based architecture to solve an inner discretized ODE w.r.t. its
length. Then, we employ time- and length-wise consistency terms during flow
matching training, and as a result, the sampling can be performed with an
arbitrary number of time steps and transformer blocks. Unlike others, our
$\textrm{ODE}_t \left(\textrm{ODE}_l \right)$ approach is solver-agnostic in
time dimension and decreases both latency and memory usage. Compared to the
previous state of the art, image generation experiments on CelebA-HQ and
ImageNet show a latency reduction of up to $3\times$ in the most efficient
sampling mode, and a FID score improvement of up to $3.5$ points for
high-quality sampling. We release our code and model weights with fully
reproducible experiments.

Conclusion: MMFeD3-HidE为联邦多模态知识图谱补全提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing multimodal knowledge privatization requirements,
multimodal knowledge graphs in different institutes are usually decentralized,
lacking of effective collaboration system with both stronger reasoning ability
and transmission safety guarantees. In this paper, we propose the Federated
Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion (FedMKGC) task, aiming at training over
federated MKGs for better predicting the missing links in clients without
sharing sensitive knowledge. We propose a framework named MMFeD3-HidE for
addressing multimodal uncertain unavailability and multimodal client
heterogeneity challenges of FedMKGC. (1) Inside the clients, our proposed
Hyper-modal Imputation Diffusion Embedding model (HidE) recovers the complete
multimodal distributions from incomplete entity embeddings constrained by
available modalities. (2) Among clients, our proposed Multimodal FeDerated Dual
Distillation (MMFeD3) transfers knowledge mutually between clients and the
server with logit and feature distillation to improve both global convergence
and semantic consistency. We propose a FedMKGC benchmark for a comprehensive
evaluation, consisting of a general FedMKGC backbone named MMFedE, datasets
with heterogeneous multimodal information, and three groups of constructed
baselines. Experiments conducted on our benchmark validate the effectiveness,
semantic consistency, and convergence robustness of MMFeD3-HidE.

Motivation: 传统表格回归方法在处理复杂系统数据（如配置文件和系统日志）时效果不佳，因为特征工程难以实现。

Method: 采用60M参数的编码器-解码器模型，从随机初始化开始训练，进行文本到文本回归。

Result: 在Google的Borg调度系统中，模型实现了接近完美的0.99（平均0.9）等级相关性，MSE比表格方法低100倍，并能轻松适应新任务。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂系统数据的预测提供了一种通用解决方案，并展示了其在不确定性量化和适应性方面的优势。

Abstract: In many industries, predicting metric outcomes of large systems is a
fundamental problem, driven largely by traditional tabular regression. However,
such methods struggle on complex systems data in the wild such as configuration
files or system logs, where feature engineering is often infeasible. We propose
text-to-text regression as a general, scalable alternative. For predicting
resource efficiency on Borg, Google's massive compute cluster scheduling
system, a 60M parameter encoder-decoder, trained from random initialization,
achieves up to a near perfect 0.99 (0.9 average) rank correlation across the
entire fleet, and 100x lower MSE than tabular approaches. The model also easily
adapts to new tasks in only 500 few-shot examples and captures the densities of
complex outcome distributions. Ablation studies highlight the importance of
using encoders, increasing sequence length, and the model's inherent
uncertainty quantification. These findings pave the way for universal
simulators of real-world outcomes.

Motivation: 传统IRT估计需要集中所有个体原始数据，可能导致隐私问题。联邦学习的隐私保护和分布式计算特性为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出FedIRT框架，结合联邦学习和IRT模型，支持分布式估计，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: FedIRT扩展了IRT在分布式环境（如多校评估）中的应用，兼具准确性和安全性，并提供了开源R包支持实践。

Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models have been widely used to estimate
respondents' latent abilities and calibrate items' difficulty. Traditional IRT
estimation requires all individual raw response data to be centralized in one
place, thus potentially causing privacy issues. Federated learning is an
emerging field in computer science and machine learning with added features of
privacy protection and distributed computing. To integrate the advances from
federated learning with modern psychometrics, we propose a novel framework,
Federated Item Response Theory (IRT), to enable estimating traditional IRT
models with additional privacy, allowing estimation in a distributed manner
without losing estimation accuracy.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that FedIRT achieves statistical accuracy
similar to standard IRT estimation using popular R packages, while offering
critical advantages: privacy protection and reduced communication costs. We
also validate FedIRT's utility through a real-world exam dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness in realistic educational contexts. This new framework extends
IRT's applicability to distributed settings, such as multi-school assessments,
without sacrificing accuracy or security. To support practical adoption, we
provide an open-ource R package, FedIRT, implementing the framework for the
two-parameter logistic (2PL) and partial credit models (PCM).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经模糊网络（NFNs）虽然具有透明性和符号表达能力，但其系统化设计过程仍具挑战性，现有方法往往低效地分离参数和结构优化。

Method: 采用梯度基础的神经可塑性适应方法，同时优化NFNs的参数和结构，使其适用于在线强化学习等复杂任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在基于视觉的视频游戏DOOM中，通过在线强化学习训练NFNs，取得了显著效果。

Conclusion: 同时优化NFNs的参数和结构是一种有效的方法，能够解决传统设计中的问题，并扩展其应用范围。

Abstract: Neuro-fuzzy networks (NFNs) are transparent, symbolic, and universal function
approximations that perform as well as conventional neural architectures, but
their knowledge is expressed as linguistic IF-THEN rules. Despite these
advantages, their systematic design process remains a challenge. Existing work
will often sequentially build NFNs by inefficiently isolating parametric and
structural identification, leading to a premature commitment to brittle and
subpar architecture. We propose a novel application-independent approach called
gradient-based neuroplastic adaptation for the concurrent optimization of NFNs'
parameters and structure. By recognizing that NFNs' parameters and structure
should be optimized simultaneously as they are deeply conjoined, settings
previously unapproachable for NFNs are now accessible, such as the online
reinforcement learning of NFNs for vision-based tasks. The effectiveness of
concurrently optimizing NFNs is empirically shown as it is trained by online
reinforcement learning to proficiently play challenging scenarios from a
vision-based video game called DOOM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模型的方法（如DreamerV3）忽略控制中心表示，而基于模型的方法（如PPO）样本复杂度高且探索能力弱。M3PO旨在解决这些问题。

Method: M3PO结合隐式世界模型（预测任务结果而非观察重建）和混合探索策略（模型规划与模型无关的不确定性奖励），并通过信任区域优化器稳定策略更新。

Result: M3PO在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提供了高效且稳健的替代方案。

Conclusion: M3PO通过消除偏差-方差权衡，显著提升了模型基于策略优化的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Massively Multi-Task Model-Based Policy Optimization (M3PO), a
scalable model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework designed to
address sample inefficiency in single-task settings and poor generalization in
multi-task domains. Existing model-based approaches like DreamerV3 rely on
pixel-level generative models that neglect control-centric representations,
while model-free methods such as PPO suffer from high sample complexity and
weak exploration. M3PO integrates an implicit world model, trained to predict
task outcomes without observation reconstruction, with a hybrid exploration
strategy that combines model-based planning and model-free uncertainty-driven
bonuses. This eliminates the bias-variance trade-off in prior methods by using
discrepancies between model-based and model-free value estimates to guide
exploration, while maintaining stable policy updates through a trust-region
optimizer. M3PO provides an efficient and robust alternative to existing
model-based policy optimization approaches and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph foundation models using graph neural networks promise sustainable,
efficient atomistic modeling. To tackle challenges of processing multi-source,
multi-fidelity data during pre-training, recent studies employ multi-task
learning, in which shared message passing layers initially process input
atomistic structures regardless of source, then route them to multiple decoding
heads that predict data-specific outputs. This approach stabilizes pre-training
and enhances a model's transferability to unexplored chemical regions.
Preliminary results on approximately four million structures are encouraging,
yet questions remain about generalizability to larger, more diverse datasets
and scalability on supercomputers. We propose a multi-task parallelism method
that distributes each head across computing resources with GPU acceleration.
Implemented in the open-source HydraGNN architecture, our method was trained on
over 24 million structures from five datasets and tested on the Perlmutter,
Aurora, and Frontier supercomputers, demonstrating efficient scaling on all
three highly heterogeneous super-computing architectures.

Motivation: 探索神经网络如何从连续学习过渡到离散符号推理，为神经符号系统的设计提供理论基础。

Result: 发现训练过程中参数测度经历解耦和自由度收缩，形成符合代数操作的组合表示，并建立了数据缩放定律。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解神经符号系统提供了理论基础，支持连续学习与离散代数推理的结合。

Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that explains how discrete symbolic
structures can emerge naturally from continuous neural network training
dynamics. By lifting neural parameters to a measure space and modeling training
as Wasserstein gradient flow, we show that under geometric constraints, such as
group invariance, the parameter measure $\mu_t$ undergoes two concurrent
phenomena: (1) a decoupling of the gradient flow into independent optimization
trajectories over some potential functions, and (2) a progressive contraction
on the degree of freedom. These potentials encode algebraic constraints
relevant to the task and act as ring homomorphisms under a commutative
semi-ring structure on the measure space. As training progresses, the network
transitions from a high-dimensional exploration to compositional
representations that comply with algebraic operations and exhibit a lower
degree of freedom. We further establish data scaling laws for realizing
symbolic tasks, linking representational capacity to the group invariance that
facilitates symbolic solutions. This framework charts a principled foundation
for understanding and designing neurosymbolic systems that integrate continuous
learning with discrete algebraic reasoning.

Result: BP结合检查点在准确性、收敛速度和计算效率上显著优于FmAD和ZO，尤其是在大模型或有限扰动预算下。

Conclusion: BP结合检查点是内存受限设置下最有效的训练策略，FmAD和ZO存在根本性局限。

Abstract: Forward-mode automatic differentiation (FmAD) and zero-order (ZO)
optimization have been proposed as memory-efficient alternatives to
backpropagation (BP) for gradient computation, especially in low-resource
settings. However, their practical benefits remain unclear due to two key gaps:
a lack of comparison against memory-efficient BP variants, such as activation
checkpointing, and a lack of a unified theoretical analysis. This work presents
a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of BP, FmAD, and ZO
methods. Our theoretical analysis shows that while FmAD, and ZO can reduce
memory usage, they incur significant costs in accuracy, convergence speed, and
computation compared to BP with checkpointing. These drawbacks worsen with
larger models or constrained perturbation budgets. Empirical experiments on
large language and vision-language models show that BP with checkpointing
outperforms FmAD and ZO variants, including those enhanced with variance
reduction, achieving up to 31.1% higher accuracy, 34.8% faster convergence, and
3.8x fewer computations at comparable memory usage. Our results highlight
fundamental limitations of FmAD and ZO, and reaffirm BP with checkpointing as
the most effective strategy for model training under memory-constrained
settings. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is sometimes difficult to achieve a complete observation for a full set of
observables, and partial observations are necessary. For deterministic systems,
the Mori-Zwanzig formalism provides a theoretical framework for handling
partial observations. Recently, data-driven algorithms based on the Koopman
operator theory have made significant progress, and there is a discussion to
connect the Mori-Zwanzig formalism with the Koopman operator theory. In this
work, we discuss the effects of partial observation in stochastic systems using
the Koopman operator theory. The discussion clarifies the importance of
distinguishing the state space and the function space in stochastic systems.
Even in stochastic systems, the delay embedding technique is beneficial for
partial observation, and several numerical experiments showed a power-law
behavior of the accuracy for the amplitude of the additive noise. We also
discuss the relation between the exponent of the power-law behavior and the
effects of partial observation.

generalize across tasks restricts its applicability in dynamic and real-world
environments. With the arisen of Continual Learning (CL), Continual
Reinforcement Learning (CRL) has emerged as a promising research direction to
address these limitations by enabling agents to learn continuously, adapt to
new tasks, and retain previously acquired knowledge. In this survey, we provide
a comprehensive examination of CRL, focusing on its core concepts, challenges,
and methodologies. Firstly, we conduct a detailed review of existing works,
organizing and analyzing their metrics, tasks, benchmarks, and scenario
settings. Secondly, we propose a new taxonomy of CRL methods, categorizing them
into four types from the perspective of knowledge storage and/or transfer.
Finally, our analysis highlights the unique challenges of CRL and provides
practical insights into future directions.

Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks demands a fundamental shift from bit-centric
transmission to semantic-aware communication that emphasizes task-relevant
information. This work introduces TOAST (Task-Oriented Adaptive Semantic
Transmission), a unified framework designed to address the core challenge of
multi-task optimization in dynamic wireless environments through three
complementary components. First, we formulate adaptive task balancing as a
Markov decision process, employing deep reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust the trade-off between image reconstruction fidelity and semantic
classification accuracy based on real-time channel conditions. Second, we
integrate module-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) mechanisms throughout our
Swin Transformer-based joint source-channel coding architecture, enabling
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that dramatically reduces adaptation overhead
while maintaining full performance across diverse channel impairments including
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN), fading, phase noise, and impulse
interference. Third, we incorporate an Elucidating diffusion model that
operates in the latent space to restore features corrupted by channel noises,
providing substantial quality improvements compared to baseline approaches.
Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that TOAST achieves
superior performance compared to baseline approaches, with significant
improvements in both classification accuracy and reconstruction quality at low
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions while maintaining robust performance
across all tested scenarios.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) offer potential for near-term quantum
advantage but face challenges from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish, and
poorly conditioned optimization landscapes. We introduce GuiderNet, a
meta-learning framework that conditions Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs)
using data-dependent parameter shifts aimed at minimizing the log condition
number of the Fubini-Study metric tensor. Implemented as a classical neural
network, GuiderNet is meta-trained to guide PQC parameters into geometrically
favorable regions and is embedded within hybrid quantum-classical pipelines to
steer both initialization and adaptive modulation during training.
  Applied to the Kaggle Diabetes classification task, GuiderNet reduces
cumulative training loss by over 5x, improves test accuracy from 75.3% to
98.6%, and increases the minority-class F1 score from 0.67 to 0.95. It also
suppresses gradient explosion and stabilizes parameter updates, enabling
smoother and more robust optimization. These results demonstrate that geometric
meta-conditioning can mitigate barren plateaus and ill-conditioning, providing

Motivation: 解决DAS应用中真实事件数据有限的问题，同时提升事件识别和去噪性能。

Result: 在公共数据集和实际应用中表现优于或接近数据驱动网络，泛化能力强，故障诊断准确率达91.8%。

Conclusion: 该范式为DAS应用中的数据获取和噪声问题提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The
proposed paradigm is a prospective solution to address significant obstacles of
data acquisition and intense noise in practical DAS applications and explore
more potential fields for DAS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的输出重加权遗忘方法RWFT，无需完全重新训练即可从分类器中删除特定类别，解决了现有遗忘方法在预测未学习类别时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强制执行用户删除权利和减少有害或偏见预测的需求，现有方法无法完全模拟重新训练模型的行为。

Method: 通过重新分配遗忘类别的预测概率质量，设计了一种对MIA-NN攻击鲁棒的方法，并引入基于TV距离的新度量标准。

Result: 实验表明，RWFT在现有评估指标和新提出的TV距离指标上均优于现有方法，分别提升了2.79%和111.45%。

Conclusion: RWFT是一种高效且安全的遗忘方法，能够在不完全重新训练的情况下达到与重新训练相当的效果。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce an output-reweighting unlearning method, RWFT, a
lightweight technique that erases an entire class from a trained classifier
without full retraining. Forgetting specific classes from trained models is
essential for enforcing user deletion rights and mitigating harmful or biased
predictions. The full retraining is costly and existing unlearning methods fail
to replicate the behavior of the retrained models when predicting samples from
the unlearned class. We prove this failure by designing a variant of membership
inference attacks, MIA-NN that successfully reveals the unlearned class for any
of these methods. We propose a simple redistribution of the probability mass
for the prediction on the samples in the forgotten class which is robust to
MIA-NN. We also introduce a new metric based on the total variation (TV)
distance of the prediction probabilities to quantify residual leakage to
prevent future methods from susceptibility to the new attack. Through extensive
experiments with state of the art baselines in machine unlearning, we show that
our approach matches the results of full retraining in both metrics used for
evaluation by prior work and the new metric we propose in this work. Compare to
state-of-the-art methods, we gain 2.79% in previously used metrics and 111.45%
in our new TV-based metric over the best existing method.

Motivation: 在线广告竞价中，传统DT存在预设RTG值和数据质量限制的问题，需要改进以提升自动竞价效果。

Method: 提出R* DT，分三步：R DT存储状态和RTG值；R^ DT预测最高RTG值；R* DT通过生成高奖励轨迹优化训练数据。

Result: 在公开竞价数据集上验证了R* DT的有效性，尤其在处理混合质量轨迹时表现更优。

Conclusion: R* DT通过数据增强和逐步优化策略，显著提升了自动竞价的性能。

Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.

Conclusion: 分箱半参数贝叶斯网络是一种更高效且可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new type of probabilistic semiparametric model that
takes advantage of data binning to reduce the computational cost of kernel
density estimation in nonparametric distributions. Two new conditional
probability distributions are developed for the new binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks, the sparse binned kernel density estimation and the Fourier
kernel density estimation. These two probability distributions address the
curse of dimensionality, which typically impacts binned models, by using sparse
tensors and restricting the number of parent nodes in conditional probability
calculations. To evaluate the proposal, we perform a complexity analysis and
conduct several comparative experiments using synthetic data and datasets from
the UCI Machine Learning repository. The experiments include different binning
rules, parent restrictions, grid sizes, and number of instances to get a
holistic view of the model's behavior. As a result, our binned semiparametric
Bayesian networks achieve structural learning and log-likelihood estimations
with no statistically significant differences compared to the semiparametric
Bayesian networks, but at a much higher speed. Thus, the new binned
semiparametric Bayesian networks prove to be a reliable and more efficient
alternative to their non-binned counterparts.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实践上均表现出色，为图时间序列分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inference tasks with time series over graphs are of importance in
applications such as urban water networks, economics, and networked
neuroscience. Addressing these tasks typically relies on identifying a
computationally affordable model that jointly captures the graph-temporal
patterns of the data. In this work, we propose a graph-aware state space model
for graph time series, where both the latent state and the observation equation
are parametric graph-induced models with a limited number of parameters that
need to be learned. More specifically, we consider the state equation to follow
a stochastic partial differential equation driven by noise over the graphs
edges accounting not only for potential edge uncertainties but also for
increasing the degrees of freedom in the latter in a tractable manner. The
graph structure conditioning of the noise dispersion allows the state variable
to deviate from the stochastic process in certain neighborhoods. The
observation model is a sampled and graph-filtered version of the state
capturing multi-hop neighboring influence. The goal is to learn the parameters
in both state and observation models from the partially observed data for
downstream tasks such as prediction and imputation. The model is inferred first
through a maximum likelihood approach that provides theoretical tractability
but is limited in expressivity and scalability. To improve on the latter, we
use the state-space formulation to build a principled deep learning
architecture that jointly learns the parameters and tracks the state in an
end-to-end manner in the spirit of Kalman neural networks.

TL;DR: TROFI是一种离线强化学习方法，通过从人类偏好学习奖励函数，无需预定义奖励函数即可训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在离线强化学习中，奖励函数通常不可用，TROFI旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TROFI从人类偏好学习奖励函数，并用其标注数据集以训练策略。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，TROFI表现优于基线，接近使用真实奖励的效果。

Conclusion: 奖励函数的设计对策略学习至关重要，TROFI展示了其有效性。

Abstract: In offline reinforcement learning, agents are trained using only a fixed set
of stored transitions derived from a source policy. However, this requires that
the dataset be labeled by a reward function. In applied settings such as video
game development, the availability of the reward function is not always
guaranteed. This paper proposes Trajectory-Ranked OFfline Inverse reinforcement
learning (TROFI), a novel approach to effectively learn a policy offline
without a pre-defined reward function. TROFI first learns a reward function
from human preferences, which it then uses to label the original dataset making
it usable for training the policy. In contrast to other approaches, our method
does not require optimal trajectories. Through experiments on the D4RL
benchmark we demonstrate that TROFI consistently outperforms baselines and
performs comparably to using the ground truth reward to learn policies.
Additionally, we validate the efficacy of our method in a 3D game environment.
Our studies of the reward model highlight the importance of the reward function
in this setting: we show that to ensure the alignment of a value function to
the actual future discounted reward, it is fundamental to have a
well-engineered and easy-to-learn reward function.

TL;DR: UniCA框架通过协变量同质化和统一注意力融合机制，解决了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在处理异构协变量时的局限性，提升了其在多模态协变量预测任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSFMs主要针对实值序列设计，难以处理异构协变量（如分类变量、多模态数据），限制了其在通用预测任务中的应用。

Method: UniCA通过协变量同质化将异构协变量转化为同质序列表示，并通过统一注意力机制融合这些表示。

Result: 在多个单模态和多模态协变量预测基准测试中，UniCA表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: UniCA展示了协变量感知的TSFM适应在现实预测场景中的潜力，并保持了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工和领域知识，难以普及。

Method: 采用分层模块化神经符号集成，通过DSL表达物理先验并指导RL。

Result: PiPRL优于纯符号或神经策略，训练时间减少26%。

Conclusion: PiPRL为物理控制任务提供高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: When using reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle physical control tasks,
inductive biases that encode physics priors can help improve sample efficiency
during training and enhance generalization in testing. However, the current
practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases
inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them
prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to
distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics
priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable
and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into
an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional
physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a
physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to
indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic
integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful
features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic
programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a
low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL
consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces
training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为GPAS的简单技术，用于解决Pre-LN Transformer中激活方差指数增长的问题，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-LN Transformer在预训练中稳定且可扩展，但存在激活方差指数增长的问题，导致深层学习能力受限。

Method: 提出Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS)，通过缩放中间激活值但保持梯度不变，避免梯度消失问题。

Result: 在71M到1B的不同规模模型上，GPAS均表现出性能提升，且适用于其他架构如Sandwich-LN和DeepNorm。

Conclusion: GPAS是一种通用且有效的技术，可改善多种架构的训练动态。

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,
predominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While
being stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN
suffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,
causing the residual path to dominate over sub-layer outputs and limiting the
learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate this issue, we propose
Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple technique that can be
used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works by scaling down the
intermediate activations while keeping their gradients unchanged. This leaves
information in the activations intact, and avoids the gradient vanishing
problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive experiments across
various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves consistent
performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also shows
promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and
DeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training
dynamics in a wide range of settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机传感器易受物理攻击（如GPS欺骗），传统安全强化学习方法对此无效，需开发更鲁棒的控制方法。

Method: ARMOR采用两阶段训练：教师编码器利用特权攻击信息生成潜在状态，学生编码器通过监督学习近似教师输出，无需特权信息即可部署。

Result: 实验表明ARMOR优于传统方法，确保无人机安全，提升对未知攻击的泛化能力，并降低训练成本。

Conclusion: ARMOR为无人机在传感器攻击下的安全运行提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception,
navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical
attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to
unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control
capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We
present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations),
an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation
under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor
observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical
state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher
encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware
latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is
trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states
using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without
privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms
conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves
generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the
need for iterative adversarial training.

Abstract: The volatility and complex dynamics of cryptocurrency markets present unique
challenges for accurate price forecasting. This research proposes a hybrid deep

macroeconomic indicators. The model is evaluated on historical datasets of
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin, incorporating both global and
localized exchange data. Comparative analysis using Mean Absolute Percentage

TL;DR: Transformer架构与图神经网络（GNNs）在表示学习上的联系被揭示，Transformer可视为在完全连接图上运行的消息传递GNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer与GNNs之间的数学联系，揭示其作为高效集合处理网络的潜力。

Method: 将Transformer的自注意力机制解释为图上的消息传递，并分析其硬件效率优势。

Result: Transformer在硬件效率上优于稀疏消息传递的GNNs，成为当前硬件环境下的优势架构。

Conclusion: Transformer是硬件优化的GNNs，展现了在表示学习中的高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: We establish connections between the Transformer architecture, originally
introduced for natural language processing, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
for representation learning on graphs. We show how Transformers can be viewed
as message passing GNNs operating on fully connected graphs of tokens, where
the self-attention mechanism capture the relative importance of all tokens
w.r.t. each-other, and positional encodings provide hints about sequential
ordering or structure. Thus, Transformers are expressive set processing
networks that learn relationships among input elements without being
constrained by apriori graphs. Despite this mathematical connection to GNNs,
Transformers are implemented via dense matrix operations that are significantly
more efficient on modern hardware than sparse message passing. This leads to
the perspective that Transformers are GNNs currently winning the hardware
lottery.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种基于神经网络的路径规划方法，用于多目标多图场景，并在实验中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多图场景下的多目标路径规划问题具有实际意义，但现有方法对此关注不足。

Method: 第一种方法直接在多图上自回归选择边；第二种方法先剪枝为简单图再构建路径。

Result: 两种方法在TSP和CVRP等问题上表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的神经网络方法在多目标多图路径规划中具有潜力。

Abstract: Learning-based methods for routing have gained significant attention in
recent years, both in single-objective and multi-objective contexts. However,
the multigraph setting, where multiple paths with distinct attributes can exist
between destinations, has largely been overlooked, despite its high practical
relevancy. In this paper, we introduce two neural approaches to address
multi-objective routing on multigraphs. Our first approach works directly on
the multigraph, by autoregressively selecting edges until a tour is completed.
On the other hand, our second model first prunes the multigraph into a simple
graph and then builds routes. We validate both models experimentally and find
that they demonstrate strong performance across a variety of problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing
Problem (CVRP).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PLI评估方法繁琐且数据收集困难，需要一种更高效、准确的替代方案。

Method: 利用迁移学习开发了一种定量评估方法，预测PLI，并在澳大利亚六个主要港口的数据上进行了验证。

Result: 模型表现优异，MAE和MAPE分别为0.5和0.03，优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型为水质预测提供了一种创新、经济高效的方法，有助于环境保护和工业监测。

Abstract: Detecting heavy metal pollution in soils and seaports is vital for regional
environmental monitoring. The Pollution Load Index (PLI), an international
standard, is commonly used to assess heavy metal containment. However, the
conventional PLI assessment involves laborious procedures and data analysis of
sediment samples. To address this challenge, we propose a deep-learning-based
model that simplifies the heavy metal assessment process. Our model tackles the
issue of data scarcity in the water-sediment domain, which is traditionally
plagued by challenges in data collection and varying standards across nations.
By leveraging transfer learning, we develop an accurate quantitative assessment
method for predicting PLI. Our approach allows the transfer of learned features
across domains with different sets of features. We evaluate our model using
data from six major ports in New South Wales, Australia: Port Yamba, Port
Newcastle, Port Jackson, Port Botany, Port Kembla, and Port Eden. The results
demonstrate significantly lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute
Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately 0.5 and 0.03, respectively, compared
to other models. Our model performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude than
other baseline models. Our proposed model offers an innovative, accessible, and
cost-effective approach to predicting water quality, benefiting marine life
conservation, aquaculture, and industrial pollution monitoring.

Result: 研究通过混淆矩阵等技术评估模型性能，识别了影响地震脆弱性的关键因素，提升了损坏等级预测的准确性。

Conclusion: SMOTE技术有效解决了类别不平衡问题，结合多种模型显著提高了地震后建筑损坏预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: In the aftermath of major earthquakes, evaluating structural and
infrastructural damage is vital for coordinating post-disaster response
efforts. This includes assessing damage's extent and spatial distribution to
prioritize rescue operations and resource allocation. Accurately estimating
damage grades to buildings post-earthquake is paramount for effective response
and recovery, given the significant impact on lives and properties,
underscoring the urgency of streamlining relief fund allocation processes.
Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of multi-class classification,
especially XGBoost, along with other machine learning models and ensembling
methods, incorporating regularization to address class imbalance. One
consequence of class imbalance is that it may give rise to skewed models that
undervalue minority classes and give preference to the majority class. This
research deals with the problem of class imbalance with the help of the
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We delve into multiple
multi-class classification machine learning, deep learning models, and
ensembling methods to forecast structural damage grades. The study elucidates
performance determinants through comprehensive feature manipulation experiments
and diverse training approaches. It identifies key factors contributing to
seismic vulnerability while evaluating model performance using techniques like
the confusion matrix further to enhance understanding of the effectiveness of
earthquake damage prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了Thompson采样的适用性，为控制律学习提供了高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is an effective method to explore parametric
uncertainties and can therefore be used for active learning-based controller
design. However, TS relies on finite parametric representations, which limits
its applicability to more general spaces, which are more commonly encountered
in control system design. To address this issue, this work pro poses a
parameterization method for control law learning using reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces and designs a data-driven active learning control approach.
Specifically, the proposed method treats the control law as an element in a
function space, allowing the design of control laws without imposing
restrictions on the system structure or the form of the controller. A TS
framework is proposed in this work to explore potential optimal control laws,
and the convergence guarantees are further provided for the learning process.
Theoretical analysis shows that the proposed method learns the relationship
between control laws and closed-loop performance metrics at an exponential
rate, and the upper bound of control regret is also derived. Numerical
experiments on controlling unknown nonlinear systems validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements, machine learning, particularly deep learning, is
hindered by the need for large amounts of labeled data to learn meaningful
patterns without overfitting and immense demands for computation and storage,
which motivate research into architectures that can achieve good performance
with fewer resources. This paper introduces dreaMLearning, a novel framework
that enables learning from compressed data without decompression, built upon
Entropy-based Generalized Deduplication (EntroGeDe), an entropy-driven lossless
compression method that consolidates information into a compact set of
representative samples. DreaMLearning accommodates a wide range of data types,
tasks, and model architectures. Extensive experiments on regression and
classification tasks with tabular and image data demonstrate that dreaMLearning
accelerates training by up to 8.8x, reduces memory usage by 10x, and cuts
storage by 42%, with a minimal impact on model performance. These advancements
enhance diverse ML applications, including distributed and federated learning,
and tinyML on resource-constrained edge devices, unlocking new possibilities

Abstract: Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for
storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this
data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep
Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized
as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural
architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty,
there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of
various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs.
  In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for
evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of
over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside
key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior
performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping
performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural
properties.

Result: 实验表明，EFRame提高了训练的鲁棒性和效率，并解锁了GRPO无法达到的更深层次推理能力。

Conclusion: EFRame不仅优化了GRPO的性能，还提供了对训练样本更细粒度的分析，推动了强化学习的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's
computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and
instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To
address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay
framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions.
EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories,
applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise
and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but
informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle,
guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to
convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of
training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain
unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more
fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis
of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our
code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.

Conclusion: 该方法在风险感知决策任务中具有广泛适用性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Decision making under uncertain environments in the maximization of expected
reward while minimizing its risk is one of the ubiquitous problems in many
subjects. Here, we introduce a novel problem setting in stochastic bandit
optimization that jointly addresses two critical aspects of decision-making:
maximizing expected reward and minimizing associated uncertainty, quantified
via the mean-variance(MV) criterion. Unlike traditional bandit formulations
that focus solely on expected returns, our objective is to efficiently and
accurately identify the Pareto-optimal set of arms that strikes the best
trade-off between expected performance and risk. We propose a unified
meta-algorithmic framework capable of operating under both fixed-confidence and
fixed-budget regimes, achieved through adaptive design of confidence intervals
tailored to each scenario using the same sample exploration strategy. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the correctness of the returned solutions in
both settings. To complement this theoretical analysis, we conduct extensive
empirical evaluations across synthetic benchmarks, demonstrating that our
approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and sample
efficiency, highlighting its broad applicability to risk-aware decision-making
tasks in uncertain environments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在高质量模型上优于硬剪枝和重新训练方法，且性能随token数量增加而提升。

Conclusion: Projected Compression是一种高效的模型压缩方法，计算开销低且性能优越。

Abstract: Large language models have steadily increased in size to achieve improved
performance; however, this growth has also led to greater inference time and
computational demands. Consequently, there is rising interest in model size
reduction methods. To address this issue, we propose Projected Compression, a
novel model compression technique, that reduces model weights by utilizing
projection modules. Specifically, we first train additional trainable
projections weights and preserve access to all the original model parameters.
Subsequently, these projections are merged into a lower-dimensional product
matrix, resulting in a reduced-size standard Transformer-based model. Unlike
alternative approaches that require additional computational overhead, our
method matches the base model's per-token computation step in FLOPs.
Experimental results show that Projected Compression outperforms the comparable
hard pruning and retraining approach on higher quality models. Moreover, the
performance margin scales well with the number of tokens.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在稀疏张量、连续时间张量和视觉数据上均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统方法的限制，能够学习更复杂的结构和分布，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor decompositions (TDs) provide an effective framework for
multiway data analysis. Traditional TD methods rely on predefined structural
assumptions, such as CP or Tucker decompositions. From a probabilistic
perspective, these can be viewed as using Dirac delta distributions to model
the relationships between shared factors and the low-rank tensor. However, such
prior knowledge is rarely available in practical scenarios, particularly
regarding the optimal rank structure and contraction rules. The optimization
procedures based on fixed contraction rules are complex, and approximations
made during these processes often lead to accuracy loss. To address this issue,
we propose a score-based model that eliminates the need for predefined
structural or distributional assumptions, enabling the learning of
compatibility between tensors and shared factors. Specifically, a neural
network is designed to learn the energy function, which is optimized via score
matching to capture the gradient of the joint log-probability of tensor entries
and shared factors. Our method allows for modeling structures and distributions
beyond the Dirac delta assumption. Moreover, integrating the block coordinate
descent (BCD) algorithm with the proposed smooth regularization enables the
model to perform both tensor completion and denoising. Experimental results
demonstrate significant performance improvements across various tensor types,
including sparse and continuous-time tensors, as well as visual data.

Motivation: 现实图中的噪声和不完整性严重影响了GNN的性能，现有方法仅关注单维增强（拓扑或属性），忽略了二者的深层交互。

Method: CoATA通过双通道框架，先传播结构信号增强节点属性，再将其投影到二分图中优化结构，并引入对比学习进行相互校正。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，CoATA优于十一种现有方法，证明了其在捕捉拓扑与属性协同关系上的有效性。

Conclusion: CoATA通过联合增强拓扑和属性，显著提升了GNN在噪声和不完整图中的性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered substantial attention due to their
remarkable capability in learning graph representations. However, real-world
graphs often exhibit substantial noise and incompleteness, which severely
degrades the performance of GNNs. Existing methods typically address this issue
through single-dimensional augmentation, focusing either on refining topology
structures or perturbing node attributes, thereby overlooking the deeper
interplays between the two. To bridge this gap, this paper presents CoATA, a
dual-channel GNN framework specifically designed for the Co-Augmentation of
Topology and Attribute. Specifically, CoATA first propagates structural signals
to enrich and denoise node attributes. Then, it projects the enhanced attribute
space into a node-attribute bipartite graph for further refinement or
reconstruction of the underlying structure. Subsequently, CoATA introduces
contrastive learning, leveraging prototype alignment and consistency
constraints, to facilitate mutual corrections between the augmented and
original graphs. Finally, extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CoATA outperforms eleven state-of-the-art
baseline methods, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing the synergistic
relationship between topology and attributes.

Conclusion: 该方法在现实医疗场景中有效，尤其适用于类别比例不一致的领域自适应问题。

Abstract: Domain shift is a significant challenge in machine learning, particularly in
medical applications where data distributions differ across institutions due to
variations in data collection practices, equipment, and procedures. This can
degrade performance when models trained on source domain data are applied to
the target domain. Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to
address this issue, but most struggle when class proportions between the source
and target domains differ. In this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method that leverages class proportion information from the target
domain, which is often accessible in medical datasets through prior knowledge
or statistical reports. Our method assigns pseudo-labels to the unlabeled
target data based on class proportion (called proportion-constrained
pseudo-labeling), improving performance without the need for additional
annotations. Experiments on two endoscopic datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms semi-supervised domain adaptation techniques, even when 5% of the
target domain is labeled. Additionally, the experimental results with noisy
proportion labels highlight the robustness of our method, further demonstrating
its effectiveness in real-world application scenarios.

Motivation: 传统CFM采样依赖非线性ODE求解，计算成本高且难以解释。本文旨在加速CFM并提供生成过程的结构化分析。

Method: 结合Koopman算子理论，设计无解码器的Koopman-CFM架构，在学习的嵌入空间中实现线性动态，支持闭式一步采样。

Conclusion: Koopman增强的CFM结合了采样效率和可解释性，为快速且结构化的生成建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.

Result: LGES比GES快10倍，结构错误更少，且能纠正错误假设。

Conclusion: LGES在理论和实验中均优于GES，适用于观测和干预数据。

Abstract: Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) is a classic score-based algorithm for causal
discovery from observational data. In the sample limit, it recovers the Markov
equivalence class of graphs that describe the data. Still, it faces two
challenges in practice: computational cost and finite-sample accuracy. In this
paper, we develop Less Greedy Equivalence Search (LGES), a variant of GES that
retains its theoretical guarantees while partially addressing these
limitations. LGES modifies the greedy step: rather than always applying the
highest-scoring insertion, it avoids edge insertions between variables for
which the score implies some conditional independence. This more targeted
search yields up to a \(10\)-fold speed-up and a substantial reduction in
structural error relative to GES. Moreover, LGES can guide the search using
prior assumptions, while correcting these assumptions when contradicted by the
data. Finally, LGES can exploit interventional data to refine the learned
observational equivalence class. We prove that LGES recovers the true
equivalence class in the sample limit from observational and interventional
data, even with misspecified prior assumptions. Experiments demonstrate that
LGES outperforms GES and other baselines in speed, accuracy, and robustness to
misspecified assumptions. Our code is available at

Abstract: It is now well understood that diverse datasets provide a lot of value in key
epidemiology and public health analyses, such as forecasting and nowcasting,
development of epidemic models, evaluation and design of interventions and
resource allocation. Some of these datasets are often sensitive, and need
adequate privacy protections. There are many models of privacy, but
Differential Privacy (DP) has become a de facto standard because of its strong
guarantees, without making models about adversaries. In this paper, we develop
a framework the integrates deep learning and epidemic models to simultaneously
perform epidemic forecasting and learning a mechanistic model of epidemic
spread, while incorporating multiple datasets for these analyses, including
some with DP guarantees. We demonstrate our framework using a realistic but
synthetic financial dataset with DP; such a dataset has not been used in such
epidemic analyses. We show that this dataset provides significant value in

Abstract: In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于概率框架的推理时间缩放方法OptScale，通过理论下限和动态采样优化计算效率，显著减少采样开销并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间缩放方法依赖启发式策略，缺乏理论基础，导致计算效率低下。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，OptScale显著减少采样开销，性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 为推理时间缩放提供了理论基础和实用解决方案，填补了高效部署LLM的空白。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing the
reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing
approaches often rely on heuristic strategies for parallel sampling, lacking a
principled foundation. To address this gap, we propose a probabilistic
framework that formalizes the optimality of inference-time scaling under the
assumption that parallel samples are independently and identically distributed
(i.i.d.), and where the Best-of-N selection strategy follows a probability
distribution that can be estimated. Within this framework, we derive a
theoretical lower bound on the required number of samples to achieve a target
performance level, providing the first principled guidance for
compute-efficient scaling. Leveraging this insight, we develop
\textsc{OptScale}, a practical algorithm that dynamically determines the
optimal number of sampled responses. \textsc{OptScale} employs a language
model-based predictor to estimate probabilistic prior parameters, enabling the
decision of the minimal number of samples needed that satisfy predefined
performance thresholds and confidence levels. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks (including MATH-500, GSM8K, AIME, and AMC)
demonstrate that \textsc{OptScale} significantly reduces sampling overhead
while remaining better or on par with state-of-the-art reasoning performance.
Our work offers both a theoretical foundation and a practical solution for
principled inference-time scaling, addressing a critical gap in the efficient
deployment of LLMs for complex reasoning.

Result: DNA在性能上与密集基线模型相当，并能学习计算效率和参数共享；模块路径呈现幂律分布，部分路径表现出专业化特征。

Conclusion: DNA展示了动态计算路径的潜力，能够以可解释的方式分配计算和参数，为高效模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce and train distributed neural architectures (DNA) in vision and
language domains. DNAs are initialized with a proto-architecture that consists
of (transformer, MLP, attention, etc.) modules and routers. Any token (or
patch) can traverse any series of modules in any order. DNAs are a natural
generalization of the sparse methods such as Mixture-of-Experts,
Mixture-of-Depths, parameter sharing, etc. Computation and communication
patterns of DNA modules are learnt end-to-end during training and depend on the
content and context of each token (or patch). These patterns can be shaped by
further requirements added to the optimization objective such as compute/memory
efficiency or load balancing. We empirically show that (i) trained DNAs are
competitive with the dense baselines in both domains and (ii) compute
efficiency/parameter sharing can be learnt from data. Next, we analyze the
emergent connectivity and computation patterns in the trained DNAs. We find
that the paths that tokens take through the models are themselves distributed
according to a power-law. We show that some paths (or, equivalently, groups of
modules) show emergent specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that models
learn to allocate compute and active parameters in an interpretable way.

Conclusion: 该框架提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为医疗AI系统的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Adapting machine learning models to medical time series across different
domains remains a challenge due to complex temporal dependencies and dynamic
distribution shifts. Current approaches often focus on isolated feature
representations, limiting their ability to fully capture the intricate temporal
dynamics necessary for robust domain adaptation. In this work, we propose a
novel framework leveraging multi-view contrastive learning to integrate
temporal patterns, derivative-based dynamics, and frequency-domain features.
Our method employs independent encoders and a hierarchical fusion mechanism to
learn feature-invariant representations that are transferable across domains
while preserving temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on diverse medical
datasets, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and
electromyography (EMG) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in transfer learning tasks. By advancing the
robustness and generalizability of machine learning models, our framework
offers a practical pathway for deploying reliable AI systems in diverse
healthcare settings.

Result: VAC在有限和无限时间范围内具有近乎最优的遗憾保证，并可推广到一般函数逼近。

Conclusion: VAC为探索与利用的平衡提供了高效且理论支持的新方案。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) with complex function approximations such
as transformers and deep neural networks plays a significant role in the modern
practice of artificial intelligence. Despite its popularity and importance,
balancing the fundamental trade-off between exploration and exploitation
remains a long-standing challenge; in particular, we are still in lack of
efficient and practical schemes that are backed by theoretical performance
guarantees. Motivated by recent developments in exploration via optimistic
regularization, this paper provides an interpretation of the principle of
optimism through the lens of primal-dual optimization. From this fresh
perspective, we set forth a new value-incentivized actor-critic (VAC) method,
which optimizes a single easy-to-optimize objective integrating exploration and
exploitation -- it promotes state-action and policy estimates that are both
consistent with collected data transitions and result in higher value
functions. Theoretically, the proposed VAC method has near-optimal regret
guarantees under linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) in both finite-horizon
and infinite-horizon settings, which can be extended to the general function
approximation setting under appropriate assumptions.

TL;DR: CLoVE是一种新颖的聚类联邦学习算法，通过损失向量嵌入识别客户端集群，无需最优初始化，适用于监督和无监督任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决聚类联邦学习中客户端集群识别困难的问题，利用损失值的相似性区分不同集群。

Method: 利用客户端的损失向量嵌入，迭代识别和分离不同集群，通过联邦聚合优化集群特定模型。

Result: 理论证明CLoVE能准确恢复集群，实验显示其在少量训练轮次内实现高精度集群恢复和模型性能。

Conclusion: CLoVE简单、鲁棒，适用于多种任务，性能优于现有算法。

Abstract: We propose CLoVE (Clustering of Loss Vector Embeddings), a novel algorithm
for Clustered Federated Learning (CFL). In CFL, clients are naturally grouped
into clusters based on their data distribution. However, identifying these
clusters is challenging, as client assignments are unknown. CLoVE utilizes
client embeddings derived from model losses on client data, and leverages the
insight that clients in the same cluster share similar loss values, while those
in different clusters exhibit distinct loss patterns. Based on these
embeddings, CLoVE is able to iteratively identify and separate clients from
different clusters and optimize cluster-specific models through federated
aggregation. Key advantages of CLoVE over existing CFL algorithms are (1) its
simplicity, (2) its applicability to both supervised and unsupervised settings,
and (3) the fact that it eliminates the need for near-optimal model
initialization, which makes it more robust and better suited for real-world
applications. We establish theoretical convergence bounds, showing that CLoVE
can recover clusters accurately with high probability in a single round and
converges exponentially fast to optimal models in a linear setting. Our
comprehensive experiments comparing with a variety of both CFL and generic
Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) algorithms on different types of datasets
and an extensive array of non-IID settings demonstrate that CLoVE achieves
highly accurate cluster recovery in just a few rounds of training, along with
state-of-the-art model accuracy, across a variety of both supervised and
unsupervised PFL tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有机器人系统功能单一、缺乏统一认知架构的问题，追求人机交互的高效与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FrankenBot成功整合多功能，为复杂环境下的机器人操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing a general robot manipulation system capable of performing a wide
range of tasks in complex, dynamic, and unstructured real-world environments
has long been a challenging task. It is widely recognized that achieving
human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to
integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy
generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving
high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge,
exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning
capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a
single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without
integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a
divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose
FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that
achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our
framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions
from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional
completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy
generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex,
cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and
design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted
comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic
environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in
anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and
stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.

Abstract: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics
Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial
autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is
software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++
expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark
contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled
modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework
designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that
allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using
state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy)
while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots.
A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked
publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure
real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control,
SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with
native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from
manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless
hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of
mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices
under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates

Abstract: Detecting traversable pathways in unstructured outdoor environments remains a
significant challenge for autonomous robots, especially in critical
applications such as wide-area search and rescue, as well as incident
management scenarios like forest fires. Existing datasets and models primarily
target urban settings or wide, vehicle-traversable off-road tracks, leaving a
substantial gap in addressing the complexity of narrow, trail-like off-road
scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Trail-based Off-road Multimodal
Dataset (TOMD), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for such
environments. TOMD features high-fidelity multimodal sensor data -- including
128-channel LiDAR, stereo imagery, GNSS, IMU, and illumination measurements --
collected through repeated traversals under diverse conditions. We also propose
a dynamic multiscale data fusion model for accurate traversable pathway
prediction. The study analyzes the performance of early, cross, and mixed
fusion strategies under varying illumination levels. Results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach and the relevance of illumination in segmentation
performance. We publicly release TOMD at https://github.com/yyyxs1125/TMOD to

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of guidewire shapes is crucial
for precise navigation in robot-assisted endovascular interventions.
Conventional 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is limited by the absence
of depth information, leading to spatial ambiguities that hinder reliable
guidewire shape sensing. This paper introduces a novel multimodal framework for
real-time 3D guidewire reconstruction, combining preoperative 3D Computed
Tomography Angiography (CTA) with intraoperative 2D DSA images. The method
utilizes robust feature extraction to address noise and distortion in 2D DSA
data, followed by deformable image registration to align the 2D projections
with the 3D CTA model. Subsequently, the inverse projection algorithm
reconstructs the 3D guidewire shape, providing real-time, accurate spatial
information. This framework significantly enhances spatial awareness for
robotic-assisted endovascular procedures, effectively bridging the gap between
preoperative planning and intraoperative execution. The system demonstrates
notable improvements in real-time processing speed, reconstruction accuracy,
and computational efficiency. The proposed method achieves a projection error
of 1.76$\pm$0.08 pixels and a length deviation of 2.93$\pm$0.15\%, with a frame
rate of 39.3$\pm$1.5 frames per second (FPS). These advancements have the
potential to optimize robotic performance and increase the precision of complex

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse
applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental
monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must
land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an
essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate
landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To
address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings,
powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model
integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection
and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We
introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the
system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new
dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to
support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system
achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%,

Abstract: Robotic teleoperation over long communication distances poses challenges due
to delays in commands and feedback from network latency. One simple yet
effective strategy to reduce errors and increase performance under delay is to
downscale the relative motion between the operating surgeon and the robot. The
question remains as to what is the optimal scaling factor, and how this value
changes depending on the level of latency as well as operator tendencies. We
present user studies investigating the relationship between latency, scaling
factor, and performance. The results of our studies demonstrate a statistically
significant difference in performance between users and across scaling factors
for certain levels of delay. These findings indicate that the optimal scaling
factor for a given level of delay is specific to each user, motivating the need
for personalized models for optimal performance. We present techniques to model
the user-specific mapping of latency level to scaling factor for optimal
performance, leading to an efficient and effective solution to optimizing
performance of robotic teleoperation and specifically telesurgery under large
communication delay.

Abstract: Vision-based lane keeping is a topic of significant interest in the robotics
and autonomous ground vehicles communities in various on-road and off-road
applications. The skid-steered vehicle architecture has served as a useful
vehicle platform for human controlled operations. However, systematic modeling,
especially of the skid-slip wheel terrain interactions (primarily in off-road
settings) has created bottlenecks for automation deployment. End-to-end
learning based methods such as imitation learning and deep reinforcement
learning, have gained prominence as a viable deployment option to counter the
lack of accurate analytical models. However, the systematic formulation and
subsequent verification/validation in dynamic operation regimes (particularly
for skid-steered vehicles) remains a work in progress. To this end, a novel
approach for structured formulation for learning visual navigation is proposed
and investigated in this work. Extensive software simulations, hardware
evaluations and ablation studies now highlight the significantly improved
performance of the proposed approach against contemporary literature.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots have demonstrated exceptional locomotion capabilities

However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots
has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing

waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to
autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while
avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a
simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level
control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of
various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path
planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with
diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and
real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse
complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准闭集方法和开放词汇对象检测（OVOD）在室内动态环境中因领域偏移导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用源数据无关的领域自适应（SFDA），通过时间聚类优化伪标签，多尺度阈值融合，以及结合对比学习的Mean Teacher框架。

Result: 在EDAOD基准测试中，零样本检测性能显著提升，能够灵活适应动态室内条件。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了室内环境中的领域偏移问题，提升了对象检测的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Mobile robots rely on object detectors for perception and object localization
in indoor environments. However, standard closed-set methods struggle to handle
the diverse objects and dynamic conditions encountered in real homes and labs.
Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models
(VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in
indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA)
approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We
refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold
fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning. Our
Embodied Domain Adaptation for Object Detection (EDAOD) benchmark evaluates
adaptation under sequential changes in lighting, layout, and object diversity.
Our experiments show significant gains in zero-shot detection performance and
flexible adaptation to dynamic indoor conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一种混合整数线性规划（MILP）方法，用于多智能体运动规划，通过嵌入PAAMP和序列-求解流程，显著减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体运动规划中计算复杂度高的问题，通过优化约束和减少变量数量提高效率。

Method: 结合PAAMP和序列-求解流程，使用凸多面体区域序列和大M超平面模型确保智能体分离，减少碰撞约束的变量数量。

Result: 在代表性多智能体场景中，该方法比非结构化MILP基线快一个数量级，且能生成无碰撞的平滑轨迹。

Conclusion: 该方法在多智能体运动规划中具有高效性和实用性，显著提升了计算速度和轨迹质量。

Abstract: We propose a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for multi-agent motion
planning that embeds Polytopic Action-based Motion Planning (PAAMP) into a
sequence-then-solve pipeline. Region sequences confine each agent to adjacent
convex polytopes, while a big-M hyperplane model enforces inter-agent
separation. Collision constraints are applied only to agents sharing or
neighboring a region, which reduces binary variables exponentially compared
with naive formulations. An L1 path-length-plus-acceleration cost yields smooth
trajectories. We prove finite-time convergence and demonstrate on
representative multi-agent scenarios with obstacles that our formulation
produces collision-free trajectories an order of magnitude faster than an
unstructured MILP baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出LMPVC架构，结合LLM的代码生成能力，并引入策略银行（Policy Bank）系统，实现策略编程和教学功能。

Result: LMPVC能够适应不同下游任务，无需耗时且昂贵的训练过程，弥补了底层LLM的局限性。

Abstract: Modern industry is increasingly moving away from mass manufacturing, towards
more specialized and personalized products. As manufacturing tasks become more
complex, full automation is not always an option, human involvement may be
required. This has increased the need for advanced human robot collaboration
(HRC), and with it, improved methods for interaction, such as voice control.
Recent advances in natural language processing, driven by artificial
intelligence (AI), have the potential to answer this demand. Large language
models (LLMs) have rapidly developed very impressive general reasoning
capabilities, and many methods of applying this to robotics have been proposed,
including through the use of code generation. This paper presents Language
Model Program Voice Control (LMPVC), an LLM-based prototype voice control
architecture with integrated policy programming and teaching capabilities,
built for use with Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) compatible robots. The
architecture builds on prior works using code generation for voice control by
implementing an additional programming and teaching system, the Policy Bank. We
find this system can compensate for the limitations of the underlying LLM, and
allow LMPVC to adapt to different downstream tasks without a slow and costly
training process. The architecture and additional results are released on
GitHub (https://github.com/ozzyuni/LMPVC).

Result: 通过多机器人实验验证了方法的有效性及其在工业场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为DLO的工业组装提供了集成解决方案，展示了实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Industrial assembly of deformable linear objects (DLOs) such as cables offers
great potential for many industries. However, DLOs pose several challenges for
robot-based automation due to the inherent complexity of deformation and,
consequentially, the difficulties in anticipating the behavior of DLOs in
dynamic situations. Although existing studies have addressed isolated
subproblems like shape tracking, grasping, and shape control, there has been
limited exploration of integrated workflows that combine these individual
processes. To address this gap, we propose an object-centric perception and
planning framework to achieve a comprehensive DLO assembly process throughout
the industrial value chain. The framework utilizes visual and tactile
information to track the DLO's shape as well as contact state across different
stages, which facilitates effective planning of robot actions. Our approach
encompasses robot-based bin picking of DLOs from cluttered environments,
followed by a coordinated handover to two additional robots that mount the DLOs
onto designated fixtures. Real-world experiments employing a setup with
multiple robots demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its relevance
to industrial scenarios.

Motivation: Dijkstra算法在离散图空间中广泛应用，但其在移动机器人表面路径规划中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于黎曼度量模型构建新的度量，将表面路径规划问题转化为2D平面几何问题，确保投影映射为等距浸入。

Result: RM-Dijkstra算法在复杂场景中表现优于传统算法，路径精度和平滑度更高。

Conclusion: RM-Dijkstra算法有效解决了表面最优路径规划问题，并在复杂场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The Dijkstra algorithm is a classic path planning method, which operates in a
discrete graph space to determine the shortest path from a specified source
point to a target node or all other nodes based on non-negative edge weights.
Numerous studies have focused on the Dijkstra algorithm due to its potential
application. However, its application in surface path planning for mobile
robots remains largely unexplored. In this letter, a surface optimal path
planning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian
metric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection
plane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into
a geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the
standard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects
environmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is
an isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the
experimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only
effectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also
outperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and
smoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,
high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating
such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface
Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed
for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework
combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities,
including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic
datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents.
Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep
learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an
open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation
research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

Abstract: This work presents KnotDLO, a method for one-handed Deformable Linear Object
(DLO) knot tying that is robust to occlusion, repeatable for varying rope
initial configurations, interpretable for generating motion policies, and
requires no human demonstrations or training. Grasp and target waypoints for
future DLO states are planned from the current DLO shape. Grasp poses are
computed from indexing the tracked piecewise linear curve representing the DLO
state based on the current curve shape and are piecewise continuous. KnotDLO
computes intermediate waypoints from the geometry of the current DLO state and
the desired next state. The system decouples visual reasoning from control. In
16 trials of knot tying, KnotDLO achieves a 50% success rate in tying an
overhand knot from previously unseen configurations.

Abstract: Accurate weed management is essential for mitigating significant crop yield
losses, necessitating effective weed suppression strategies in agricultural
systems. Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil
erosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and
enhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground
biomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly
due to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential
for identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted
management strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC
map, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making
regarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual
inspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive
field size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In
this context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are
two prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation.
This study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed
for agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data,
leveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass
predictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a
coefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in
diverse field conditions. This approach offers valuable insights for
site-specific management, enabling precise weed suppression strategies and
promoting sustainable farming practices.

Motivation: 传统自回归语音合成模型在处理长语音序列时存在延迟和合成质量下降的问题，限制了实时应用。

Method: 引入动态分块自回归合成框架（DCAR），采用分块到帧的注意力机制和多令牌预测训练，动态调整预测范围。

Result: DCAR在测试集上显著优于传统模型，清晰度提升72.27%，推理速度提升2.61倍。

Conclusion: DCAR为下一代语音合成系统提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) language models have emerged as a dominant
approach in speech synthesis, offering expressive generation and scalable
training. However, conventional AR speech synthesis models relying on the
next-token prediction paradigm often encounter significant challenges when
handling long speech sequences. These models often struggle to construct stable
frame-to-frame attention, leading to increased latency and degraded synthesis
quality, thereby limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To
address these limitations, we introduce a novel dynamic chunk-wise
autoregressive synthesis framework, termed DCAR, designed to enhance both
efficiency and intelligibility robustness in AR speech generation. DCAR
introduces a chunk-to-frame attention mechanism through training with
multi-token prediction, enabling dynamic chunk prediction in variable speech
contexts using a lightweight module trained on-policy. DCAR dynamically adjusts
the token prediction span, significantly reducing the sequence length
dependency while obtaining high synthesis quality. Comprehensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that DCAR substantially outperforms traditional
next-token prediction models, achieving up to 72.27% intelligibility
improvement and 2.61x inference speedup simultaneously on the test set.
Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive analysis to support it as a versatile
foundation for next-generation speech synthesis systems.

Conclusion: 神经网络在MIDI与音频对齐任务中具有显著潜力，可推动技术进步。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach for synchronizing audio
recordings of human piano performances with their corresponding loosely aligned
MIDI files. The task is addressed using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural
Network (CRNN) architecture, which effectively captures spectral and temporal
features by processing an unaligned piano roll and a spectrogram as inputs to
estimate the aligned piano roll. To train the network, we create a dataset of
piano pieces with augmented MIDI files that simulate common human timing
errors. The proposed model achieves up to 20% higher alignment accuracy than
the industry-standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) method across various
tolerance windows. Furthermore, integrating DTW with the CRNN yields additional
improvements, offering enhanced robustness and consistency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of neural networks in advancing state-of-the-art
MIDI-to-audio alignment.

Motivation: 压力传感器在HVAC系统中广泛使用，其数据可能被用于窃听，但现有技术仅能检测关键词。WaLi旨在从低分辨率噪声数据中重建完整语音。

Method: 使用复杂值Conformer和CGAB捕捉音素依赖关系，处理HVAC噪声，重建缺失频率的幅度和相位。

Result: 在真实传感器上测试，LSD为1.24，NISQA-MOS为1.78，0.5kHz至8kHz上采样效果显著。

Conclusion: WaLi的高精度语音重建能力对隐私构成新威胁，需引起重视。

Abstract: Pressure sensors are an integrated component of modern Heating, Ventilation,
and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. As these pressure sensors operate within
the 0-10 Pa range, support high sampling frequencies of 0.5-2 kHz, and are
often placed close to human proximity, they can be used to eavesdrop on
confidential conversation, since human speech has a similar audible range of
0-10 Pa and a bandwidth of 4 kHz for intelligible quality. This paper presents
WaLi, which reconstructs intelligible speech from the low-resolution and noisy
pressure sensor data by providing the following technical contributions: (i)
WaLi reconstructs intelligible speech from a minimum of 0.5 kHz sampling
frequency of pressure sensors, whereas previous work can only detect hot
words/phrases. WaLi uses complex-valued conformer and Complex Global Attention
Block (CGAB) to capture inter-phoneme and intra-phoneme dependencies that exist
in the low-resolution pressure sensor data. (ii) WaLi handles the transient
noise injected from HVAC fans and duct vibrations, by reconstructing both the
clean magnitude and phase of the missing frequencies of the low-frequency
aliased components. Extensive measurement studies on real-world pressure
sensors show an LSD of 1.24 and NISQA-MOS of 1.78 for 0.5 kHz to 8 kHz
upsampling. We believe that such levels of accuracy pose a significant threat
when viewed from a privacy perspective that has not been addressed before for
pressure sensors.

Abstract: Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are utilized to ensure the safety of control
systems. CBFs act as safety filters in order to provide safety guarantees
without compromising system performance. These safety guarantees rely on the
construction of valid CBFs. Due to their complexity, CBFs can be represented by
neural networks, known as neural CBFs (NCBFs). Existing works on the
verification of the NCBF focus on the synthesis and verification of NCBFs in
deterministic settings, leaving the stochastic NCBFs (SNCBFs) less studied. In
this work, we propose a verifiably safe synthesis for SNCBFs. We consider the
cases of smooth SNCBFs with twice-differentiable activation functions and
SNCBFs that utilize the Rectified Linear Unit or ReLU activation function. We
propose a verification-free synthesis framework for smooth SNCBFs and a
verification-in-the-loop synthesis framework for both smooth and ReLU SNCBFs.
and we validate our frameworks in three cases, namely, the inverted pendulum,
Darboux, and the unicycle model.

Conclusion: 多维公平分配问题在理论和实际中具有重要意义，提出的松弛概念和算法为复杂环境下的公平分配提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper explores the fair allocation of indivisible items in a
multidimensional setting, motivated by the need to address fairness in complex
environments where agents assess bundles according to multiple criteria. Such
multidimensional settings are not merely of theoretical interest but are
central to many real-world applications. For example, cloud computing resources
are evaluated based on multiple criteria such as CPU cores, memory, and network
bandwidth. In such cases, traditional one dimensional fairness notions fail to
capture fairness across multiple attributes. To address these challenges, we
study two relaxed variants of envy-freeness: weak simultaneously envy-free up
to c goods (weak sEFc) and strong simultaneously envy-free up to c goods
(strong sEFc), which accommodate the multidimensionality of agents'
preferences. Under the weak notion, for every pair of agents and for each
dimension, any perceived envy can be eliminated by removing, if necessary, a
different set of goods from the envied agent's allocation. In contrast, the
strong version requires selecting a single set of goods whose removal from the
envied bundle simultaneously eliminates envy in every dimension. We provide
upper and lower bounds on the relaxation parameter c that guarantee the
existence of weak or strong sEFc allocations, where these bounds are
independent of the total number of items. In addition, we present algorithms
for checking whether a weak or strong sEFc allocation exists. Moreover, we
establish NP-hardness results for checking the existence of weak sEF1 and
strong sEF1 allocations.

Abstract: Fetal sleep is a relatively underexplored yet vital aspect of prenatal
neurodevelopment. Understanding fetal sleep patterns could provide insights
into early brain maturation and help clinicians detect signs of neurological
compromise that arise due to fetal hypoxia or fetal growth restriction. This
review synthesizes over eight decades of research on the physiological
characteristics, ontogeny, and regulation of fetal sleep. We compare
sleep-state patterns in humans and large animal models, highlighting
species-specific differences and the presence of sleep-state analogs. We review
both invasive techniques in animals and non-invasive modalities in humans.
Computational methods for sleep-state classification are also examined,
including rule-based approaches (with and without clustering-based
preprocessing) and state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. Finally, we
discuss how intrauterine conditions such as hypoxia and fetal growth
restriction can disrupt fetal sleep. This review provides a comprehensive
foundation for the development of objective, multimodal, and non-invasive fetal
sleep monitoring technologies to support early diagnosis and intervention in
prenatal care.

TL;DR: 提出PhotonSplat框架，利用SPAD传感器的高速成像能力解决运动模糊问题，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经渲染技术在输入图像因快速运动而模糊时表现不佳，SPAD传感器的高速成像能力为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 引入PhotonSplat框架，直接从SPAD二进制图像重建3D场景，结合3D空间滤波降噪，支持无参考和有参考的颜色化。

Result: 成功实现从模糊图像中高质量3D重建，支持动态场景，并贡献了PhotonScenes数据集。

Conclusion: PhotonSplat框架有效解决了运动模糊问题，扩展了神经渲染的应用场景。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction using neural rendering have enabled
high-quality 3D capture. However, they often fail when the input imagery is
corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in
the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by
using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing
technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use
of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary
images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we
introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly
from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off.
Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce
noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using
generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image,
enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and
appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate
dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving
objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset
captured with the SPAD sensors.

Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes
from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking
systems, offering a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative for
volumetric imaging. However, it presents significant challenges, including
accurate inter-frame motion estimation, minimisation of drift accumulation over
long sequences, and generalisability across scanning protocols. The TUS-REC2024
Challenge was established to benchmark and accelerate progress in trackerless
3D ultrasound reconstruction by providing a publicly available dataset for the
first time, along with a baseline model and evaluation framework. The Challenge
attracted over 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid
dockerized solutions. Submitted methods spanned a wide range of algorithmic
approaches, including recurrent models, registration-driven volume refinement,
attention, and physics-informed models. This paper presents an overview of the
Challenge design, summarises the key characteristics of the dataset, provides a
concise literature review, introduces the technical details of the underlying
methodology working with tracked freehand ultrasound data, and offers a
comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics.
The results highlight both the progress and current limitations of
state-of-the-art approaches in this domain, and inform directions for future
research. The data, evaluation code, and baseline are publicly available to
facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving
benchmark, this Challenge is designed to be continuously developed and
improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and will be organised again at
MICCAI 2025, reflecting its growing impact and the sustained commitment to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF的分割方法仅依赖RGB数据，缺乏材料属性，限制了材料感知的准确性。

Method: 通过漫反射和镜面反射分量建模光谱反射率，利用全局端元字典表示纯材料特征，并通过点丰度分布进行分割。

Result: 实验证明该方法在高光谱重建和材料分割上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UnMix-NeRF为材料感知和场景编辑提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object
semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties.
This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for
robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce
UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling
joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material
segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular
components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure
material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For
material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned
endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF
enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible
material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our
approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material
segmentation to existing methods. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的干涉高光谱成像（IHI）重建方法，通过物理模型生成训练数据，并设计了IHRUT模型提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IHI在遥感任务中具有优势，但受限于复杂误差和现有算法的不足，缺乏训练数据和难以消除特定退化成分是关键挑战。

Method: 基于成像物理建立简化退化模型和参数估计方法，生成训练数据；设计IHRUT模型，结合条纹增强机制和空间-光谱变换架构。

Result: 实验表明该方法具有优越性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了IHI重建中的关键问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for
large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral
resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging
steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based
reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement:
1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific
degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on
imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet
accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model
enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral
images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning.
Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding
Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail
restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a
spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the
superior performance and generalization capability of our method.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: StableCodec是一种基于扩散模型的图像压缩方法，通过单步去噪实现高保真和高真实感的超低比特率压缩，显著提升了编码效率和重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像压缩方法在超低比特率下需要大量去噪步骤，且难以保证像素级一致性，限制了实时应用。StableCodec旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Deep Compression Latent Codec传输噪声潜在表示，采用Dual-Branch Coding Structure增强重建保真度，并通过端到端优化联合比特率和像素级约束。

Result: 在CLIC 2020、DIV2K和Kodak数据集上，StableCodec在FID、KID和DISTS指标上显著优于现有方法，甚至在0.005 bpp下仍保持高保真。

Conclusion: StableCodec在超低比特率下实现了高效、高保真的图像压缩，且推理速度与主流变换编码方案相当。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image compression has shown remarkable potential for
achieving ultra-low bitrate coding (less than 0.05 bits per pixel) with high
realism, by leveraging the generative priors of large pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, current approaches require a large number of
denoising steps at the decoder to generate realistic results under extreme
bitrate constraints, limiting their application in real-time compression
scenarios. Additionally, these methods often sacrifice reconstruction fidelity,
as diffusion models typically fail to guarantee pixel-level consistency. To
address these challenges, we introduce StableCodec, which enables one-step
diffusion for high-fidelity and high-realism extreme image compression with
improved coding efficiency. To achieve ultra-low bitrates, we first develop an
efficient Deep Compression Latent Codec to transmit a noisy latent
representation for a single-step denoising process. We then propose a
Dual-Branch Coding Structure, consisting of a pair of auxiliary encoder and
decoder, to enhance reconstruction fidelity. Furthermore, we adopt end-to-end
optimization with joint bitrate and pixel-level constraints. Extensive
experiments on the CLIC 2020, DIV2K, and Kodak dataset demonstrate that
StableCodec outperforms existing methods in terms of FID, KID and DISTS by a
significant margin, even at bitrates as low as 0.005 bits per pixel, while
maintaining strong fidelity. Additionally, StableCodec achieves inference
speeds comparable to mainstream transform coding schemes. All source code are

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NEED的噪声启发扩散模型，用于低剂量CT重建，通过双域重建和噪声特性匹配，显著提升了泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT重建模型的泛化能力对未见剂量数据的适应性至关重要，但现有方法依赖大量配对数据或精细调整，且扩散模型可能因噪声分布偏差导致不真实结构。

Method: 提出NEED模型，包括基于移位泊松扩散的投影数据去噪和双引导扩散的图像重建，仅需正常剂量数据训练，并通过时间步匹配策略适应不同剂量。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验表明，NEED在重建和泛化性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEED通过噪声特性匹配和双域重建，显著提升了低剂量CT重建的泛化能力，且无需额外配对数据。

Abstract: The generalization of deep learning-based low-dose computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction models to doses unseen in the training data is important and
remains challenging. Previous efforts heavily rely on paired data to improve
the generalization performance and robustness through collecting either diverse
CT data for re-training or a few test data for fine-tuning. Recently, diffusion
models have shown promising and generalizable performance in low-dose CT (LDCT)
reconstruction, however, they may produce unrealistic structures due to the CT
image noise deviating from Gaussian distribution and imprecise prior
information from the guidance of noisy LDCT images. In this paper, we propose a
noise-inspired diffusion model for generalizable LDCT reconstruction, termed
NEED, which tailors diffusion models for noise characteristics of each domain.
First, we propose a novel shifted Poisson diffusion model to denoise projection
data, which aligns the diffusion process with the noise model in pre-log LDCT
projections. Second, we devise a doubly guided diffusion model to refine
reconstructed images, which leverages LDCT images and initial reconstructions
to more accurately locate prior information and enhance reconstruction
fidelity. By cascading these two diffusion models for dual-domain
reconstruction, our NEED requires only normal-dose data for training and can be
effectively extended to various unseen dose levels during testing via a time
step matching strategy. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and
segmentation-based evaluations on two datasets demonstrate that our NEED
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction and
generalization performance. Source code is made available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度学习方法，用于白质高信号（WMH）的分割和定位，支持单模态和多模态MRI输入，并评估了不同输入配置的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理缺失模态和整合解剖定位方面缺乏灵活性，因此需要一种更灵活且高效的方法。

Method: 使用深度学习框架，评估了四种输入配置（FLAIR-only、T1-only、多模态及模态可互换设置），并引入多任务模型联合预测病变和解剖区域。

Result: 多模态输入显著提高了分割性能，模态可互换设置牺牲了准确性但增强了鲁棒性。多任务学习效果不如单独模型。

Conclusion: 多模态融合对WMH分析具有重要价值，联合建模在集成预测方面具有潜力。

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are radiological markers of small vessel
disease and neurodegeneration, whose accurate segmentation and spatial
localization are crucial for diagnosis and monitoring. While multimodal MRI
offers complementary contrasts for detecting and contextualizing WM lesions,
existing approaches often lack flexibility in handling missing modalities and
fail to integrate anatomical localization efficiently. We propose a deep
learning framework for WM lesion segmentation and localization that operates
directly in native space using single- and multi-modal MRI inputs. Our study
evaluates four input configurations: FLAIR-only, T1-only, concatenated FLAIR
and T1, and a modality-interchangeable setup. It further introduces a
multi-task model for jointly predicting lesion and anatomical region masks to
estimate region-wise lesion burden. Experiments conducted on the MICCAI WMH
Segmentation Challenge dataset demonstrate that multimodal input significantly
improves the segmentation performance, outperforming unimodal models. While the
modality-interchangeable setting trades accuracy for robustness, it enables
inference in cases with missing modalities. Joint lesion-region segmentation
using multi-task learning was less effective than separate models, suggesting
representational conflict between tasks. Our findings highlight the utility of
multimodal fusion for accurate and robust WMH analysis, and the potential of
joint modeling for integrated predictions.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的CVD分类方法缺乏临床可解释性，因此需要一种更透明的方法。

Method: 将CVD分类分为图像分割、图像配准和下游分类三步，利用Atlas-ISTN框架和分割基础模型提取临床可解释特征。

Result: 在ASOCA数据集上，该方法分类准确率达87.50%，显著优于直接使用原始CT图像的模型（67.50%）。

Conclusion: 通过分步提取临床可解释特征，显著提升了CVD分类的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Automatic detection and classification of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) from
Computed Tomography (CT) images play an important part in facilitating
better-informed clinical decisions. However, most of the recent deep learning
based methods either directly work on raw CT data or utilize it in pair with
anatomical cardiac structure segmentation by training an end-to-end classifier.
As such, these approaches become much more difficult to interpret from a
clinical perspective. To address this challenge, in this work, we break down
the CVD classification pipeline into three components: (i) image segmentation,
(ii) image registration, and (iii) downstream CVD classification. Specifically,
we utilize the Atlas-ISTN framework and recent segmentation foundational models
to generate anatomical structure segmentation and a normative healthy atlas.
These are further utilized to extract clinically interpretable radiomic
features as well as deformation field based geometric features (through atlas
registration) for CVD classification. Our experiments on the publicly available
ASOCA dataset show that utilizing these features leads to better CVD
classification accuracy (87.50\%) when compared against classification model
trained directly on raw CT images (67.50\%). Our code is publicly available:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自由变形（FFD）的空间基函数和变形感知框架，用于动态CBCT重建，解决了现有方法计算成本高和运动不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态CBCT在放疗中广泛应用，但现有方法如4D高斯泼溅（4DGS）存在计算成本高和运动不一致的缺陷。

Method: 引入FFD空间基函数和变形感知框架，统一高斯均位、尺度和旋转的时变演化。

Result: 在六个CBCT数据集上验证，图像质量优于HexPlane，速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 变形感知4DGS为高效、运动补偿的CBCT重建提供了潜力。

Abstract: 3D Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) is widely used in radiotherapy but suffers from motion
artifacts due to breathing. A common clinical approach mitigates this by
sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per
phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT
instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion
without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS)
offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to
dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane,
use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While
explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial
regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these
limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis
function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by
coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and
rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six
CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over
HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS
for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HazeMatching是一种新型的迭代方法，用于去雾光显微镜图像，平衡了数据保真度和感知真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在去雾显微镜图像时无法同时兼顾数据保真度和感知真实性的问题。

Method: 采用条件流匹配框架，通过条件速度场引导生成过程，无需显式退化算子。

Result: 在5个数据集上评估，HazeMatching在保真度和真实性之间取得了平衡，优于7种基线方法。

Conclusion: HazeMatching是一种适用于真实显微镜数据的去雾方法，具有校准良好的预测能力。

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life
sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering
out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as
widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data.
Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to
cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off
tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high
PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID.
Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or
produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In
this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light
microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to
find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the
realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the
conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a
hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on
5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion
and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a
consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with
calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated
predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation
operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All
data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available
under a permissive license.

Main category: eess.IV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HDR成像依赖多曝光，导致动态场景中出现运动伪影，而现有单次曝光方法在处理高光区域时表现不佳。

Method: 利用GRR快门模式和光学随机排列技术，通过优化问题和简单总变分图像先验恢复HDR数据。

Result: 在模拟中，该方法在大量像素饱和（10%以上）时优于其他单次曝光方法，并在少量饱和（1%）时表现相当。实验原型实现了73dB的动态范围。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GRR快门和光学随机排列，实现了高效的单次曝光HDR成像，适用于动态场景和高光区域。

Abstract: High-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging is an essential technique for overcoming the
dynamic range limits of image sensors. The classic method relies on multiple
exposures, which slows capture time, resulting in motion artifacts when imaging
dynamic scenes. Single-shot HDR imaging alleviates this issue by encoding HDR
data into a single exposure, then computationally recovering it. Many
established methods use strong image priors to recover improperly exposed image
detail. These approaches struggle with extended highlight regions. We utilize
the global reset release (GRR) shutter mode of an off-the-shelf sensor. GRR
shutter mode applies a longer exposure time to rows closer to the bottom of the
sensor. We use optics that relay a randomly permuted (shuffled) image onto the
sensor, effectively creating spatially randomized exposures across the scene.
The exposure diversity allows us to recover HDR data by solving an optimization
problem with a simple total variation image prior. In simulation, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms other single-shot methods when many
sensor pixels are saturated (10% or more), and is competitive at a modest
saturation (1%). Finally, we demonstrate a physical lab prototype that uses an
off-the-shelf random fiber bundle for the optical shuffling. The fiber bundle
is coupled to a low-cost commercial sensor operating in GRR shutter mode. Our
prototype achieves a dynamic range of up to 73dB using an 8-bit sensor with
48dB dynamic range.

### [297] [Adversarial Threats in Quantum Machine Learning: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21842)
*Archisman Ghosh,Satwik Kundu,Swaroop Ghosh*

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了量子机器学习（QML）在NISQ时代面临的安全挑战，包括对抗性威胁及其防御机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着QML的快速发展，其在云部署、混合架构和生成模型中的安全漏洞日益凸显，需研究独特的对抗性威胁。

Method: 分析了QML系统中的攻击向量（如模型窃取、数据投毒等）和防御机制（如噪声水印、硬件感知混淆等）。

Result: 提出了利用量子特性防御攻击的方法，并总结了攻击与防御的最新进展。

Conclusion: 论文为构建安全、可信的QML系统提供了路线图，但仍需解决噪声平衡、跨平台攻击等开放性问题。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索KANs在量子机器学习中的潜力，利用其表达复杂函数的能力。

Method: 通过Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM)实现KAN的混合和全量子形式，利用预训练残差函数。

Result: 展示了QuKAN架构的可行性、可解释性和性能。

Conclusion: QuKAN为量子机器学习提供了一种新的高效架构。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出量子储备计算机（QRCs）及其无递归架构（RF-QRCs）是学习和预测混沌动力学的有效工具，并分析了其鲁棒性和噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子储备计算机在混沌动力学学习和预测中的应用，并探索其鲁棒性和设计方法。

Method: 将量子储备计算机建模为耦合动力系统，推导其雅可比矩阵，并提出GS=ESP准则设计鲁棒架构。

Result: 量子储备计算机能学习混沌动力学及其不变量，噪声的耗散增强了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究为近量子硬件上的混沌时间序列预测提供了鲁棒量子机器的设计思路。

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

*Lena John,Kheir Eddine Farfar,Sören Auer,Oliver Karras*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于5星级关联开放数据模型的科学知识表示演化模型，通过逐步将PDF等数字文档转化为知识图谱中的语义表示，提升知识的可访问性和可重用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学出版物通常以静态、非结构化的PDF形式存在，限制了知识的可访问性和可重用性。需要一种更灵活、结构化且具有语义的表示方法，以便人类和机器都能理解和处理。

Method: 提出了一种名为SciMantify的混合方法，利用表格格式的科学知识（如二次研究结果），通过人类与机器的协作进行语义标注任务（SATs），逐步改进科学知识的语义表示。

Result: 初步用户实验表明，该方法简化了科学知识的预处理，减少了语义化的工作量，并通过更好地与知识图谱结构对齐，提升了知识表示的质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过逐步演化的方式，将科学知识从静态PDF转化为知识图谱中的语义表示，显著提升了知识的可访问性和可重用性。

Abstract: Scientific publications, primarily digitized as PDFs, remain static and
unstructured, limiting the accessibility and reusability of the contained
knowledge. At best, scientific knowledge from publications is provided in
tabular formats, which lack semantic context. A more flexible, structured, and
semantic representation is needed to make scientific knowledge understandable
and processable by both humans and machines. We propose an evolution model of
knowledge representation, inspired by the 5-star Linked Open Data (LOD) model,
with five stages and defined criteria to guide the stepwise transition from a
digital artifact, such as a PDF, to a semantic representation integrated in a
knowledge graph (KG). Based on an exemplary workflow implementing the entire
model, we developed a hybrid approach, called SciMantify, leveraging tabular
formats of scientific knowledge, e.g., results from secondary studies, to
support its evolving semantification. In the approach, humans and machines
collaborate closely by performing semantic annotation tasks (SATs) and refining
the results to progressively improve the semantic representation of scientific
knowledge. We implemented the approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph
(ORKG), an established platform for improving the findability, accessibility,
interoperability, and reusability of scientific knowledge. A preliminary user
experiment showed that the approach simplifies the preprocessing of scientific
knowledge, reduces the effort for the evolving semantification, and enhances
the knowledge representation through better alignment with the KG structures.

TL;DR: 论文呼吁将统计学与机器学习的历史和哲学进行双重整合，并提出了一个名为“achievableism”的基础假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统计学与机器学习的界限模糊，需要整合两者的历史和哲学，以推动领域发展。

Method: 通过案例研究，追溯哲学思想在机器学习和形式认识论中的根源，并结合历史和哲学方法。

Result: 提出了“achievableism”这一基础假设，揭示了频率统计和机器学习实践中的共同点。

Conclusion: 双重整合为统计学和机器学习的未来发展提供了新的方法论和理论基础。

Abstract: The integration of the history and philosophy of statistics was initiated at
least by Hacking (1965) and advanced by Mayo (1996), but it has not received
sustained follow-up. Yet such integration is more urgent than ever, as the
recent success of artificial intelligence has been driven largely by machine
learning -- a field historically developed alongside statistics. Today, the
boundary between statistics and machine learning is increasingly blurred. What
we now need is integration, twice over: of history and philosophy, and of the
field they engage -- statistics and machine learning. I present a case study of
a philosophical idea in machine learning (and in formal epistemology) whose
root can be traced back to an often under-appreciated insight in Neyman and
Pearson's 1936 work (a follow-up to their 1933 classic). This leads to the
articulation of a foundational assumption -- largely implicit in, but shared
by, the practices of frequentist statistics and machine learning -- which I
call achievabilism. Another integration also emerges at the level of
methodology, combining two ends of the philosophy of science spectrum: history
and philosophy of science on the one hand, and formal epistemology on the other
hand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在风暴潮预测中存在空间分辨率低、依赖站点数据、泛化能力差的问题，且与现代深度学习架构不兼容。

Method: 将非结构化水位数据投影为RGB图像，结合ConvLSTM网络，并引入风场和地形作为输入。

Result: 在墨西哥湾合成风暴数据集上表现优异，支持48小时预测，并具有空间扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过结构化表示和物理驱动因素，提升了风暴潮预测的实用性、适应性和可解释性。

Abstract: Storm surge forecasting plays a crucial role in coastal disaster
preparedness, yet existing machine learning approaches often suffer from
limited spatial resolution, reliance on coastal station data, and poor
generalization. Moreover, many prior models operate directly on unstructured
spatial data, making them incompatible with modern deep learning architectures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach that projects unstructured water
elevation fields onto structured Red Green Blue (RGB)-encoded image
representations, enabling the application of Convolutional Long Short Term
Memory (ConvLSTM) networks for end-to-end spatiotemporal surge forecasting. Our
model further integrates ground-truth wind fields as dynamic conditioning
signals and topo-bathymetry as a static input, capturing physically meaningful
drivers of surge evolution. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of synthetic
storms in the Gulf of Mexico, our method demonstrates robust 48-hour
forecasting performance across multiple regions along the Texas coast and
exhibits strong spatial extensibility to other coastal areas. By combining
structured representation, physically grounded forcings, and scalable deep
learning, this study advances the frontier of storm surge forecasting in
usability, adaptability, and interpretability.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法显著提升了L-PBF中微观结构控制的效率和计算性能。

Abstract: Laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is a widely recognized additive manufacturing
technology for producing intricate metal components with exceptional accuracy.
A key challenge in L-PBF is the formation of complex microstructures affecting
product quality. We propose a physics-guided, machine-learning approach to
optimize scan paths for desired microstructure outcomes, such as equiaxed
grains. We utilized a phase-field method (PFM) to model crystalline grain
structure evolution. To reduce computational costs, we trained a surrogate
machine learning model, a 3D U-Net convolutional neural network, using
single-track phase-field simulations with various laser powers to predict
crystalline grain orientations based on initial microstructure and thermal
history. We investigated three scanning strategies across various hatch
spacings within a square domain, achieving a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup
using the surrogate model. To reduce trial and error in designing laser scan
toolpaths, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to generate optimized scan
paths for target microstructure. Results from three cases demonstrate the DRL
approach's effectiveness. We integrated the surrogate 3D U-Net model into our
DRL environment to accelerate the reinforcement learning training process. The
reward function minimizes both aspect ratio and grain volume of the predicted
microstructure from the agent's scan path. The reinforcement learning algorithm
was benchmarked against conventional zigzag approach for smaller and larger
domains, showing machine learning methods' potential to enhance microstructure
control and computational efficiency in L-PBF optimization.

Motivation: 探讨生成式AI在高等教育中的快速应用及其对学术研究、教学和评估的双重影响。

Method: 综合近期研究和案例，分析生成式AI的使用现状及其检测工具的准确性。

Result: 47%的学生在课程中使用LLMs，检测工具准确率为88%，需改进评估设计和政策。

Conclusion: 需通过政策调整、培训和多层执行机制，平衡AI的潜力与学术诚信。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools -
especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT - has ushered in a
transformative era in higher education. Universities in developed regions are
increasingly integrating these technologies into research, teaching, and
assessment. On one hand, LLMs can enhance productivity by streamlining
literature reviews, facilitating idea generation, assisting with coding and
data analysis, and even supporting grant proposal drafting. On the other hand,
their use raises significant concerns regarding academic integrity, ethical
boundaries, and equitable access. Recent empirical studies indicate that nearly
47% of students use LLMs in their coursework - with 39% using them for exam
questions and 7% for entire assignments - while detection tools currently
achieve around 88% accuracy, leaving a 12% error margin. This article
critically examines the opportunities offered by generative AI, explores the
multifaceted challenges it poses, and outlines robust policy solutions.
Emphasis is placed on redesigning assessments to be AI-resilient, enhancing
staff and student training, implementing multi-layered enforcement mechanisms,
and defining acceptable use. By synthesizing data from recent research and case
studies, the article argues that proactive policy adaptation is imperative to
harness AI's potential while safeguarding the core values of academic integrity
and equity.

Result: 攻击成功率高（超过73%），且防御措施可能被适应性攻击者绕过。

Conclusion: 这种攻击可能导致训练数据质量下降，增加模型开发成本，形成攻防对抗的循环。

Abstract: Today's text-to-image generative models are trained on millions of images
sourced from the Internet, each paired with a detailed caption produced by
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). This part of the training pipeline is critical
for supplying the models with large volumes of high-quality image-caption pairs
during training. However, recent work suggests that VLMs are vulnerable to
stealthy adversarial attacks, where adversarial perturbations are added to
images to mislead the VLMs into producing incorrect captions.
  In this paper, we explore the feasibility of adversarial mislabeling attacks
on VLMs as a mechanism to poisoning training pipelines for text-to-image
models. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs are highly vulnerable to
adversarial perturbations, allowing attackers to produce benign-looking images
that are consistently miscaptioned by the VLM models. This has the effect of
injecting strong "dirty-label" poison samples into the training pipeline for
text-to-image models, successfully altering their behavior with a small number
of poisoned samples. We find that while potential defenses can be effective,
they can be targeted and circumvented by adaptive attackers. This suggests a
cat-and-mouse game that is likely to reduce the quality of training data and
increase the cost of text-to-image model development. Finally, we demonstrate
the real-world effectiveness of these attacks, achieving high attack success
(over 73%) even in black-box scenarios against commercial VLMs (Google Vertex
AI and Microsoft Azure).

Conclusion: 改进的算法在预测COVID-19感染和康复人数方面具有更高的准确性，适用于类似流行病场景。

Abstract: Authors Yi-Cheng Chen, Ping-En Lu, Cheng-Shang Chang, and Tzu-Hsuan Liu use
the Finite Impulse Response (FIR) linear system filtering method to track and
predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19, in a
pandemic context in which there was still no vaccine and the only way to avoid
contagion was isolation. To estimate the coefficients of these FIR filters,
Chen et al. used machine learning methods through a classical optimization
problem with regularization (ridge regression). These estimated coefficients
are called ridge coefficients. The epidemic mathematical model adopted by these
researchers to formulate the FIR filters is the time-dependent discrete SIR. In
this paper, we propose a small modification to the algorithm of Chen et al. to
obtain the ridge coefficients. We then used this modified algorithm to track
and predict the number of people infected and recovered from COVID-19 in the
state of Minas Gerais/Brazil, within a prediction window, during the initial
period of the pandemic. We also compare the predicted data with the respective
real data to check how good the approximation is. In the modified algorithm, we
set values for the FIR filter orders and for the regularization parameters,
both different from the respective values defined by Chen et al. in their
algorithm. In this context, the numerical results obtained by the modified
algorithm in some simulations present better approximation errors compared to
the respective approximation errors presented by the algorithm of Chen et al.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in generating
high-fidelity images but typically suffer from inefficient sampling. Many
solver designs and noise scheduling strategies have been proposed to
dramatically improve sampling speeds. In this paper, we introduce a new
sampling method that is up to $186\%$ faster than the current state of the art
solver for comparative FID on ImageNet512. This new sampling method is
training-free and uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver. The key
to our method resides in using higher-dimensional initial noise, allowing to
produce more detailed samples with less function evaluations from existing
pretrained diffusion models. In addition, by design our solver allows to
control the level of detail through a simple hyper-parameter at no extra
computational cost. We present how our approach leverages momentum dynamics by
establishing a fundamental equivalence between momentum diffusion models and
conventional diffusion models with respect to their training paradigms.
Moreover, we observe the use of higher-dimensional noise naturally exhibits
characteristics similar to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Finally,
we demonstrate strong performances on a set of representative pretrained

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于共形预测（CP）的机器学习拒绝选项方法，用于在二元分类中避免错误预测，并提供了理论保证和实际应用示例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习模型在预测时无法判断其可信度的问题，通过拒绝选项避免可能的错误预测。

Method: 利用共形预测（CP）框架，将二元分类问题转化为带有拒绝选项的预测，并通过理论推导和数值实验验证其有效性。

Result: 论文证明了该方法在错误率上的理论保证，并通过不同CP设置展示了错误率与拒绝率之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 共形预测为机器学习拒绝选项提供了理论支持，并通过实际应用展示了其可行性和灵活性。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models always make a prediction, even when they are
likely to be wrong. This causes problems in practical applications, as we do
not know if we should trust a prediction. ML with reject option addresses this
issue by abstaining from making a prediction if it is likely to be incorrect.
In this work, we formalise the approach to ML with reject option in binary
classification, deriving theoretical guarantees on the resulting error rate.
This is achieved through conformal prediction (CP), which produce prediction
sets with distribution-free validity guarantees. In binary classification, CP
can output prediction sets containing exactly one, two or no labels. By
accepting only the singleton predictions, we turn CP into a binary classifier
with reject option.
  Here, CP is formally put in the framework of predicting with reject option.
We state and prove the resulting error rate, and give finite sample estimates.
Numerical examples provide illustrations of derived error rate through several
different conformal prediction settings, ranging from full conformal prediction
to offline batch inductive conformal prediction. The former has a direct link
to sharp validity guarantees, whereas the latter is more fuzzy in terms of
validity guarantees but can be used in practice. Error-reject curves illustrate
the trade-off between error rate and reject rate, and can serve to aid a user
to set an acceptable error rate or reject rate in practice.

Motivation: 解决函数空间中优化问题，其中目标函数是未知算子输出的已知泛函，且算子查询成本高。

Method: 采用样本后优化策略，使用神经算子替代作为高斯过程的近似样本，避免显式不确定性量化。

Result: 在偏微分方程等非线性算子驱动任务中，样本效率和性能优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实验上均表现出色，适用于高成本算子查询的优化问题。

Abstract: We propose an extension of Thompson sampling to optimization problems over
function spaces where the objective is a known functional of an unknown
operator's output. We assume that functional evaluations are inexpensive, while
queries to the operator (such as running a high-fidelity simulator) are costly.
Our algorithm employs a sample-then-optimize approach using neural operator
surrogates. This strategy avoids explicit uncertainty quantification by
treating trained neural operators as approximate samples from a Gaussian
process. We provide novel theoretical convergence guarantees, based on Gaussian
processes in the infinite-dimensional setting, under minimal assumptions. We
benchmark our method against existing baselines on functional optimization
tasks involving partial differential equations and other nonlinear
operator-driven phenomena, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and
competitive performance.

Motivation: 现实世界中的物理系统常因方程中的缺失或未知项而与真实数据生成过程（DGP）存在差异，需要结合理论驱动和数据驱动的方法来描述这种分布偏移。

Method: 采用深度灰盒建模与最优传输方法结合的混合生成模型，在数据空间中实现OT映射，同时最小化源分布失真。

Result: 实验证明该方法在生成任务和模型透明度方面表现优异，能够准确学习系统动态并保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了未配对数据问题，同时保留了物理模型的解释性，为学习物理动态提供了详细见解。

Abstract: Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential
equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately,
many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or
unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics
model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and
unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we
investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model,
combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted
distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model
approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods
to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data
space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating
superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct
usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach
leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics
while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation.
Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation
tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics
dynamics.

Conclusion: NESS是一种可靠且可解释的方法，能够为单细胞数据提供更准确的生物学见解。

Abstract: Single-cell sequencing is revolutionizing biology by enabling detailed
investigations of cell-state transitions. Many biological processes unfold
along continuous trajectories, yet it remains challenging to extract smooth,
low-dimensional representations from inherently noisy, high-dimensional
single-cell data. Neighbor embedding (NE) algorithms, such as t-SNE and UMAP,
are widely used to embed high-dimensional single-cell data into low dimensions.
But they often introduce undesirable distortions, resulting in misleading
interpretations. Existing evaluation methods for NE algorithms primarily focus
on separating discrete cell types rather than capturing continuous cell-state
transitions, while dynamic modeling approaches rely on strong assumptions about
cellular processes and specialized data. To address these challenges, we build
on the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) framework for reliable and
reproducible data-driven discoveries. First, we systematically evaluate popular
NE algorithms through empirical analysis, simulation, and theory, and reveal
their key shortcomings, such as artifacts and instability. We then introduce
NESS, a principled and interpretable machine learning approach to improve NE
representations by leveraging algorithmic stability and to enable robust
inference of smooth biological structures. NESS offers useful concepts,
quantitative stability metrics, and efficient computational workflows to
uncover developmental trajectories and cell-state transitions in single-cell
data. Finally, we apply NESS to six single-cell datasets, spanning pluripotent
stem cell differentiation, organoid development, and multiple tissue-specific
lineage trajectories. Across these diverse contexts, NESS consistently yields
useful biological insights, such as identification of transitional and stable
cell states and quantification of transcriptional dynamics during development.

Conclusion: 对于使用连续关键统计量的水印方法，水印比例参数是可识别的，且所提估计器达到极小极大下界，具有高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important
tool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from
LLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether
entire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source
texts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we
address the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in
mixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter
in a mixture model based on \emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this
parameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone
consistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ
continuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion
parameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient
estimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased
watermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable
estimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve
these lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source
text generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed
estimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文分析了深度学习中典型激活函数（如SELU、ELU、LeakyReLU）的RKHS特性，扩展了ReLU激活函数的理论范围，并探讨了不同网络深度和多项式激活函数的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习理论主要局限于ReLU激活函数，缺乏对其他常见激活函数（如SELU、ELU、LeakyReLU）的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析神经正切核（NTK）和神经网络高斯过程核（NNGP），研究了典型激活函数的RKHS特性，并探讨了网络深度和多项式激活函数的影响。

Result: 研究发现，一类非无限光滑的激活函数在不同网络深度下生成等效的RKHS，而多项式激活函数则生成非等效的RKHS。此外，还分析了NNGP样本路径的平滑性。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了深度学习理论对非ReLU激活函数的理解，为更广泛的激活函数提供了理论支持，并揭示了网络深度和激活函数类型对RKHS的影响。

Abstract: While the theory of deep learning has made some progress in recent years,
much of it is limited to the ReLU activation function. In particular, while the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) and neural network Gaussian process kernel (NNGP)
have given theoreticians tractable limiting cases of fully connected neural
networks, their properties for most activation functions except for powers of
the ReLU function are poorly understood. Our main contribution is to provide a
more general characterization of the RKHS of these kernels for typical
activation functions whose only non-smoothness is at zero, such as SELU, ELU,
or LeakyReLU. Our analysis also covers a broad set of special cases such as
missing biases, two-layer networks, or polynomial activations. Our results show
that a broad class of not infinitely smooth activations generate equivalent
RKHSs at different network depths, while polynomial activations generate
non-equivalent RKHSs. Finally, we derive results for the smoothness of NNGP
sample paths, characterizing the smoothness of infinitely wide neural networks
at initialization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测在工业4.0中具有重要应用，但现有算法多为黑箱方法，缺乏可解释性，难以满足质量与维护专家的需求。

Method: 基于统计评估的理论方法，针对声谱图设计，强调算法的可解释性。

Result: 提出了一种适用于工业场景的异常检测算法，解决了黑箱算法不适用的问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业应用提供了一种可解释且高效的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is the task of identifying rarely occurring (i.e. anormal
or anomalous) samples that differ from almost all other samples in a dataset.
As the patterns of anormal samples are usually not known a priori, this task is
highly challenging. Consequently, anomaly detection lies between semi- and
unsupervised learning. The detection of anomalies in sound data, often called
'ASD' (Anomalous Sound Detection), is a sub-field that deals with the
identification of new and yet unknown effects in acoustic recordings. It is of
great importance for various applications in Industry 4.0. Here, vibrational or
acoustic data are typically obtained from standard sensor signals used for
predictive maintenance. Examples cover machine condition monitoring or quality
assurance to track the state of components or products. However, the use of
intelligent algorithms remains a controversial topic. Management generally aims
for cost-reduction and automation, while quality and maintenance experts
emphasize the need for human expertise and comprehensible solutions. In this
work, we present an anomaly detection approach specifically designed for
spectrograms. The approach is based on statistical evaluations and is
theoretically motivated. In addition, it features intrinsic explainability,
making it particularly suitable for applications in industrial settings. Thus,
this algorithm is of relevance for applications in which black-box algorithms
are unwanted or unsuitable.

Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key
frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving
high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them
to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint.
Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation
approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate
geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a
transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for
simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic
calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism
now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced
substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is
the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate
showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular
imaging calorimeter systems.

Result: 在三个数据集上，ARAG在NDCG@5和Hit@5上分别提升42.1%和35.5%。

Conclusion: ARAG展示了智能体推理在推荐系统中的有效性，为LLM个性化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
recommendation systems by incorporating external context into large language
model prompts. However, existing RAG-based approaches often rely on static
retrieval heuristics and fail to capture nuanced user preferences in dynamic
recommendation scenarios. In this work, we introduce ARAG, an Agentic
Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework for Personalized Recommendation, which
integrates a multi-agent collaboration mechanism into the RAG pipeline. To
better understand the long-term and session behavior of the user, ARAG
leverages four specialized LLM-based agents: a User Understanding Agent that
summarizes user preferences from long-term and session contexts, a Natural
Language Inference (NLI) Agent that evaluates semantic alignment between
candidate items retrieved by RAG and inferred intent, a context summary agent
that summarizes the findings of NLI agent, and an Item Ranker Agent that
generates a ranked list of recommendations based on contextual fit. We evaluate
ARAG accross three datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that ARAG
significantly outperforms standard RAG and recency-based baselines, achieving
up to 42.1% improvement in NDCG@5 and 35.5% in Hit@5. We also, conduct an
ablation study to analyse the effect by different components of ARAG. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating agentic reasoning into
retrieval-augmented recommendation and provide new directions for LLM-based
personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统顺序推荐依赖ID嵌入，缺乏跨领域泛化能力；而基于文本的方法虽能泛化，却忽略了协同过滤信号。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：协同监督微调（适应LLMs推断物品关系）和物品级嵌入建模（结合语义与协同信息）。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LLM2Rec显著提升了领域内和跨领域的推荐质量。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于构建更鲁棒、泛化能力强的顺序推荐嵌入模型。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict users' future interactions by
modeling collaborative filtering (CF) signals from historical behaviors of
similar users or items. Traditional sequential recommenders predominantly rely
on ID-based embeddings, which capture CF signals through high-order
co-occurrence patterns. However, these embeddings depend solely on past
interactions, lacking transferable knowledge to generalize to unseen domains.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have motivated text-based
recommendation approaches that derive item representations from textual
descriptions. While these methods enhance generalization, they fail to encode
CF signals-i.e., latent item correlations and preference patterns-crucial for
effective recommendation. We argue that an ideal embedding model should
seamlessly integrate CF signals with rich semantic representations to improve
both in-domain and out-of-domain recommendation performance.
  To this end, we propose LLM2Rec, a novel embedding model tailored for
sequential recommendation, integrating the rich semantic understanding of LLMs
with CF awareness. Our approach follows a two-stage training framework: (1)
Collaborative Supervised Fine-tuning, which adapts LLMs to infer item
relationships based on historical interactions, and (2) Item-level Embedding
Modeling, which refines these specialized LLMs into structured item embedding
models that encode both semantic and collaborative information. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM2Rec effectively
improves recommendation quality across both in-domain and out-of-domain
settings. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs to build more
robust, generalizable embedding models for sequential recommendation. Our codes
are available at https://github.com/HappyPointer/LLM2Rec.

Motivation: 揭示评估基准的选择如何影响领域适应效果的感知，特别是在专业领域中，避免因基准特性导致的误导性结论。

Method: 使用ColBERTv2模型在环境监管文件（EIS）上进行微调，并在两个语义结构不同的基准上评估性能。

Result: 一个基准显示领域适应效果微小（0.61% NDCG增益），而另一个基准显示显著提升（2.22% NDCG增益），差异达3.6倍。

Conclusion: 评估基准的语义结构（如主题多样性、边界重叠）直接影响领域适应效果的评估，需选择更贴近真实复杂性的基准。

Abstract: Evaluation benchmark characteristics may distort the true benefits of domain
adaptation in retrieval models. This creates misleading assessments that
influence deployment decisions in specialized domains. We show that two
benchmarks with drastically different features such as topic diversity,
boundary overlap, and semantic complexity can influence the perceived benefits
of fine-tuning. Using environmental regulatory document retrieval as a case
study, we fine-tune ColBERTv2 model on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)
from federal agencies. We evaluate these models across two benchmarks with
different semantic structures. Our findings reveal that identical domain
adaptation approaches show very different perceived benefits depending on
evaluation methodology. On one benchmark, with clearly separated topic
boundaries, domain adaptation shows small improvements (maximum 0.61% NDCG
gain). However, on the other benchmark with overlapping semantic structures,
the same models demonstrate large improvements (up to 2.22% NDCG gain), a
3.6-fold difference in the performance benefit. We compare these benchmarks
through topic diversity metrics, finding that the higher-performing benchmark
shows 11% higher average cosine distances between contexts and 23% lower
silhouette scores, directly contributing to the observed performance
difference. These results demonstrate that benchmark selection strongly
determines assessments of retrieval system effectiveness in specialized
domains. Evaluation frameworks with well-separated topics regularly
underestimate domain adaptation benefits, while those with overlapping semantic
boundaries reveal improvements that better reflect real-world regulatory
document complexity. Our findings have important implications for developing
and deploying AI systems for interdisciplinary domains that integrate multiple
topics.

Result: 实验证明Refine-POI在真实数据集上达到state-of-the-art的top-k推荐性能。

Conclusion: Refine-POI有效解决了SFT在POI推荐中的局限性，提升了top-k推荐效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been adopted for next point-of-interest
(POI) recommendation tasks. Typical LLM-based recommenders fall into two
categories: prompt-based and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based models.
Prompt-based models generally offer greater output flexibility but deliver
lower accuracy, whereas SFT-based models achieve higher performance yet face a
fundamental mismatch: next POI recommendation data does not naturally suit
supervised fine-tuning. In SFT, the model is trained to reproduce the exact
ground truth, but each training example provides only a single target POI, so
there is no ground truth for producing a top-k list.
  To address this, we propose Refine-POI, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework
for next POI recommendation. We introduce recommendation-driven rewards that
enable LLMs to learn to generate top-k recommendation lists using only one
ground-truth POI per example. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that Refine-POI achieves state-of-the-art top-k recommendation performance.

providing a rigorous framework for quantifying and enhancing trustworthiness in

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了多样性，同时保持了相关性。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模推荐场景中具有提升用户体验的潜力。

Abstract: The challenge of balancing user relevance and content diversity in
recommender systems is increasingly critical amid growing concerns about
content homogeneity and reduced user engagement. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that leverages a multi-objective, contextual sequential
sampling strategy. Item selection is guided by Bayesian updates that
dynamically adjust scores to optimize diversity. The reward formulation
integrates multiple diversity metrics-including the log-determinant volume of a
tuned similarity submatrix and ridge leverage scores-along with a diversity
gain uncertainty term to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Both
intra- and inter-batch diversity are modeled to promote serendipity and
minimize redundancy. A dominance-based ranking procedure identifies
Pareto-optimal item sets, enabling adaptive and balanced selections at each
iteration. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach
significantly improves diversity without sacrificing relevance, demonstrating
its potential to enhance user experience in large-scale recommendation
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一不同排名任务（如推荐系统、LLM路由和项目重排）的需求，避免为每个任务设计单独模型。

Method: 使用强化学习和迭代解码框架，逐步消除候选池中最差候选，减少输出组合空间。

Result: IRanker-3B在多个数据集上达到最先进水平，甚至超越更大模型，同时在零样本任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: IRanker通过强化学习和迭代解码有效解决了排名任务的监督问题，并在泛化能力上表现出色。

Abstract: Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as
recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify
these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the
need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However,
unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear
labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To
overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with
reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose
the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the
worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly
reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context
length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate
an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation,
routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B
achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of
similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain
datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the
robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we
conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization
experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on
in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement.
Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the
base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the
thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance
zero-shot LLM performance.

TL;DR: DCN^2是对DCNv2架构的三项重要改进，解决了信息丢失和碰撞管理等问题，在多个基准数据集和实际推荐系统中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DCNv2虽然高效且广泛应用，但仍存在信息丢失和碰撞管理等局限性，需要改进以提升性能。

Method: 引入三项算法改进：解决Cross层信息丢失、可学习查找级权重管理碰撞、自定义层模拟FFM行为。

Result: DCN^2在离线、在线测试和四个公开基准数据集上均优于DCNv2，处理能力达每秒5亿预测。

Conclusion: DCN^2显著提升了推荐系统的性能，解决了DCNv2的关键问题，适用于大规模应用。

Abstract: The Deep and Cross architecture (DCNv2) is a robust production baseline and
is integral to numerous real-life recommender systems. Its inherent efficiency
and ability to model interactions often result in models that are both simpler
and highly competitive compared to more computationally demanding alternatives,
such as Deep FFMs. In this work, we introduce three significant algorithmic
improvements to the DCNv2 architecture, detailing their formulation and
behavior at scale. The enhanced architecture we refer to as DCN^2 is actively
used in a live recommender system, processing over 0.5 billion predictions per
second across diverse use cases where it out-performed DCNv2, both offline and
online (ab tests). These improvements effectively address key limitations
observed in the DCNv2, including information loss in Cross layers, implicit
management of collisions through learnable lookup-level weights, and explicit
modeling of pairwise similarities with a custom layer that emulates FFMs'
behavior. The superior performance of DCN^2 is also demonstrated on four
publicly available benchmark data sets.

TL;DR: HPC-ColPali通过分层压缩技术提升ColPali的效率，减少存储和计算成本，同时保持检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多向量文档检索系统（如ColPali）因高维补丁嵌入和延迟交互评分导致的存储和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 结合K-Means量化、注意力引导的动态剪枝和可选二进制编码三种技术。

Result: 在ViDoRe和SEC-Filings数据集上，HPC-ColPali降低了30-50%的查询延迟，同时保持高检索精度；在RAG管道中，幻觉率降低30%，端到端延迟减半。

Conclusion: HPC-ColPali是一种可扩展且高效的多向量文档检索解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-vector document retrieval systems, such as ColPali, excel in
fine-grained matching for complex queries but incur significant storage and
computational costs due to their reliance on high-dimensional patch embeddings
and late-interaction scoring. To address these challenges, we propose
HPC-ColPali, a Hierarchical Patch Compression framework that enhances the
efficiency of ColPali while preserving its retrieval accuracy. Our approach
integrates three innovative techniques: (1) K-Means quantization, which
compresses patch embeddings into 1-byte centroid indices, achieving up to
32$\times$ storage reduction; (2) attention-guided dynamic pruning, utilizing
Vision-Language Model attention weights to retain only the top-$p\%$ most
salient patches, reducing late-interaction computation by up to 60\% with less
than 2\% nDCG@10 loss; and (3) optional binary encoding of centroid indices
into $b$-bit strings ($b=\lceil\log_2 K\rceil$), enabling rapid Hamming
distance-based similarity search for resource-constrained environments.
Evaluated on the ViDoRe and SEC-Filings datasets, HPC-ColPali achieves 30--50\%
lower query latency under HNSW indexing while maintaining high retrieval
precision. When integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline for
legal summarization, it reduces hallucination rates by 30\% and halves
end-to-end latency. These advancements establish HPC-ColPali as a scalable and
efficient solution for multi-vector document retrieval across diverse
applications. Code is available at https://github.com/DngBack/HPC-ColPali.

TL;DR: CAL-RAG是一个基于检索增强和代理推理的内容感知布局生成框架，结合多模态检索、大语言模型和协作代理，显著提升了布局生成的质量和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度生成模型和大语言模型的布局生成方法缺乏对上下文设计范例的利用，且在语义对齐和视觉一致性方面表现不足。

Method: CAL-RAG通过多模态检索获取相关布局范例，利用LLM推荐布局，并通过视觉语言评分代理和反馈代理进行迭代优化。

Result: 在PKU PosterLayout数据集上，CAL-RAG在多个布局指标上达到最优性能，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合检索增强和代理多步推理，CAL-RAG为自动化布局生成提供了一种可扩展、可解释且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated content-aware layout generation -- the task of arranging visual
elements such as text, logos, and underlays on a background canvas -- remains a
fundamental yet under-explored problem in intelligent design systems. While
recent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have
shown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack
grounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic
alignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a
retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that
integrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative
agentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a
structured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to
propose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates
the layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted
refinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using
LangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in
semantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,
element alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines
such as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval
augmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,
interpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.

Motivation: 手动评估科学想法的创新性耗时且主观，难以规模化。因此，需要一种自动化方法来高效、准确地评估创新性。

Method: 采用两阶段检索增强生成框架：1）基于关键词和摘要的初步检索；2）通过嵌入过滤和基于方面的LLM重排序。结合专家标注数据指导系统评估创新性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比现有方法提高了约13%的评估一致性，且基于方面的重排序对识别相关文献至关重要。

Conclusion: Idea Novelty Checker为科学创新性评估提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Automated scientific idea generation systems have made remarkable progress,
yet the automatic evaluation of idea novelty remains a critical and
underexplored challenge. Manual evaluation of novelty through literature review
is labor-intensive, prone to error due to subjectivity, and impractical at
scale. To address these issues, we propose the Idea Novelty Checker, an
LLM-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that leverages a
two-stage retrieve-then-rerank approach. The Idea Novelty Checker first
collects a broad set of relevant papers using keyword and snippet-based
retrieval, then refines this collection through embedding-based filtering
followed by facet-based LLM re-ranking. It incorporates expert-labeled examples
to guide the system in comparing papers for novelty evaluation and in
generating literature-grounded reasoning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that our novelty checker achieves approximately 13% higher agreement than
existing approaches. Ablation studies further showcases the importance of the
facet-based re-ranker in identifying the most relevant literature for novelty
evaluation.

Conclusion: HyReC为中文混合检索提供了高效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Hybrid-based retrieval methods, which unify dense-vector and lexicon-based
retrieval, have garnered considerable attention in the industry due to
performance enhancement. However, despite their promising results, the
application of these hybrid paradigms in Chinese retrieval contexts has
remained largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce HyReC, an
innovative end-to-end optimization method tailored specifically for
hybrid-based retrieval in Chinese. HyReC enhances performance by integrating
the semantic union of terms into the representation model. Additionally, it
features the Global-Local-Aware Encoder (GLAE) to promote consistent semantic
sharing between lexicon-based and dense retrieval while minimizing the
interference between them. To further refine alignment, we incorporate a
Normalization Module (NM) that fosters mutual benefits between the retrieval
approaches. Finally, we evaluate HyReC on the C-MTEB retrieval benchmark to
demonstrate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有性别公平性度量依赖词法和频率，无法捕捉细微偏见，因此需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 利用LLM检测性别偏见，提出CWEx度量，并在MS MARCO数据集上实验。

Result: CWEx比现有度量更细致（Cohen's Kappa提升58.77%和18.51%），能有效区分排名中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 结合LLM检测、CWEx度量和标注数据集，为IR系统偏见分析提供了更鲁棒的框架。

Abstract: The presence of social biases in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Information Retrieval (IR) systems is an ongoing challenge, which underlines
the importance of developing robust approaches to identifying and evaluating
such biases. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to detect and measure gender bias in passage ranking.
Existing gender fairness metrics rely on lexical- and frequency-based measures,
leading to various limitations, e.g., missing subtle gender disparities.
Building on our LLM-based gender bias detection method, we introduce a novel
gender fairness metric, named Class-wise Weighted Exposure (CWEx), aiming to
address existing limitations. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed
metric and study LLMs' effectiveness in detecting gender bias, we annotate a
subset of the MS MARCO Passage Ranking collection and release our new gender
bias collection, called MSMGenderBias, to foster future research in this area.
Our extensive experimental results on various ranking models show that our
proposed metric offers a more detailed evaluation of fairness compared to
previous metrics, with improved alignment to human labels (58.77% for
Grep-BiasIR, and 18.51% for MSMGenderBias, measured using Cohen's Kappa
agreement), effectively distinguishing gender bias in ranking. By integrating
LLM-driven bias detection, an improved fairness metric, and gender bias
annotations for an established dataset, this work provides a more robust
framework for analyzing and mitigating bias in IR systems.

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，WTFormer在仅0.98M参数下实现了与先进系统相当的降噪性能，同时更好地保留了空间信息。

Conclusion: WTFormer是一种高效且轻量级的MIMO语音增强方法，能够显著提升空间信息保留能力。

Abstract: Current multi-channel speech enhancement systems mainly adopt single-output
architecture, which face significant challenges in preserving spatio-temporal
signal integrity during multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel neural network, termed WTFormer,
for MIMO speech enhancement that leverages the multi-resolution characteristics
of wavelet transform and multi-dimensional collaborative attention to
effectively capture globally distributed spatial features, while using
Conformer for time-frequency modeling. A multi task loss strategy accompanying
MUSIC algorithm is further proposed for optimization training to protect
spatial information to the greatest extent. Experimental results on the
LibriSpeech dataset show that WTFormer can achieve comparable denoising
performance to advanced systems while preserving more spatial information with
only 0.98M parameters.

Conclusion: DiffSoundStream通过优化标记冗余和扩散模型，显著提高了语音生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.

Motivation: 超表面的逆向设计因结构与光学特性之间的复杂非线性关系而具有挑战性，传统方法需要专家调整且易陷入局部最优。

Method: 通过结合扩散模型和RCWA模拟器，生成训练数据并训练条件扩散模型，以从目标空间功率分布预测超表面几何结构。

Result: 模型能够快速生成低误差的超表面设计，例如均匀强度分束器和偏振分束器，设计时间少于30分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动的超表面设计提供了高效工具，并公开了代码和数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Metasurfaces are ultra-thin optical elements composed of engineered
sub-wavelength structures that enable precise control of light. Their inverse
design - determining a geometry that yields a desired optical response - is
challenging due to the complex, nonlinear relationship between structure and
optical properties. This often requires expert tuning, is prone to local
minima, and involves significant computational overhead. In this work, we
address these challenges by integrating the generative capabilities of
diffusion models into computational design workflows. Using an RCWA simulator,
we generate training data consisting of metasurface geometries and their
corresponding far-field scattering patterns. We then train a conditional
diffusion model to predict meta-atom geometry and height from a target spatial
power distribution at a specified wavelength, sampled from a continuous
supported band. Once trained, the model can generate metasurfaces with low
error, either directly using RCWA-guided posterior sampling or by serving as an
initializer for traditional optimization methods. We demonstrate our approach
on the design of a spatially uniform intensity splitter and a polarization beam
splitter, both produced with low error in under 30 minutes. To support further
research in data-driven metasurface design, we publicly release our code and
datasets.

Abstract: With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated
multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for
real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and
resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node
heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To
address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC
system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and
ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from
the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint
conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and
resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling
task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution
generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph
attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of
diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete
offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a
high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with
varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed GADSG model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in
terms of optimization performance, robustness, and generalization across task
structures, showing strong potential for efficient task scheduling in dynamic
and complex low-altitude economic network environments.

Motivation: 电信领域面临复杂、多层级和多语言系统的挑战，LLMs因其逐词处理和有限上下文能力难以满足需求，而LCMs通过语义概念推理提供了更优解决方案。

Conclusion: 采用LCMs是实现AI驱动电信管理的必要进化步骤，而非简单的渐进改进。

Abstract: The telecommunications and networking domain stands at the precipice of a
transformative era, driven by the necessity to manage increasingly complex,
hierarchical, multi administrative domains (i.e., several operators on the same
path) and multilingual systems. Recent research has demonstrated that Large
Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional general-purpose text analysis
and code generation capabilities, can be effectively applied to certain telecom
problems (e.g., auto-configuration of data plan to meet certain application
requirements). However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and
limited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill
telecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,
over OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed
coordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the
abstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,
offer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom
challenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical
representation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions
within concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs
in terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal
integration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental
step, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective
AI-driven telecom management.

Conclusion: 该方法为6G网络中ML信道反馈的实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Neural network-based compression and decompression of channel state feedback
has been one of the most widely studied applications of machine learning (ML)
in wireless networks. Various simulation-based studies have shown that ML-based
feedback compression can result in reduced overhead and more accurate channel
information. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no real-life
proofs of concepts demonstrating the benefits of ML-based channel feedback
compression in a practical setting, where the user equipment (UE) and base
station have no access to each others' ML models. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for training interoperable compression and decompression ML
models in a confidential manner, and demonstrate the accuracy of the ensuing
models using prototype UEs and base stations. The performance of the ML-based
channel feedback is measured both in terms of the accuracy of the reconstructed
channel information and achieved downlink throughput gains when using the
channel information for beamforming. The reported measurement results
demonstrate that it is possible to develop an accurate ML-based channel
feedback link without having to share ML models between device and network
vendors. These results pave the way for a practical implementation of ML-based
channel feedback in commercial 6G networks.

time-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,
self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling
the extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently
transferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored
SSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail
to capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals. As a result, these methods
struggle to learn generalized representations due to their inability to model
the hierarchical structure of ECG data. To address this gap, we introduce MELP,
a novel Multi-scale ECG-Language Pretraining (MELP) model that fully leverages
hierarchical supervision from ECG-text pairs. MELP first pretrains a
cardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical
text. It then applies three levels of cross-modal supervision-at the token,
beat, and rhythm levels-to align ECG signals with textual reports, capturing
structured information across different time scales. We evaluate MELP on three
public ECG datasets across multiple tasks, including zero-shot ECG
classification, linear probing, and transfer learning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MELP outperforms existing SSL methods, underscoring its
effectiveness and adaptability across diverse clinical applications. Our code
is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/MELP.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的神经架构搜索方法，用于设计低计算复杂度的神经网络，以提升雷达目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度神经网络在雷达目标检测中表现优异，但计算复杂度高，难以在嵌入式系统中广泛应用。

Method: 采用蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）进行神经架构搜索（NAS），以平衡检测性能和计算复杂度。

Result: 在雷达信号测试中，提出的网络满足检测概率要求，且计算复杂度显著低于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法成功设计出高性能且轻量化的神经网络，适用于嵌入式雷达系统。

Abstract: Recent research works establish deep neural networks as high performing tools
for radar target detection, especially on challenging environments (presence of
clutter or interferences, multi-target scenarii...). However, the usually large
computational complexity of these networks is one of the factors preventing
them from being widely implemented in embedded radar systems. We propose to
investigate novel neural architecture search (NAS) methods, based on
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), for finding neural networks achieving the
required detection performance and striving towards a lower computational
complexity. We evaluate the searched architectures on endoclutter radar
signals, in order to compare their respective performance metrics and
generalization properties. A novel network satisfying the required detection
probability while being significantly lighter than the expert-designed baseline
is proposed.

Motivation: 搭便车作为一种非正式的出行方式，长期以来缺乏系统性研究。本文旨在通过分析大规模数据集填补这一空白。

Method: 利用hitchwiki.org和hitchmap.com平台收集的63,000多条搭便车数据，进行探索性分析，包括等待时间、用户行为和评论元数据。

Result: 数据集揭示了搭便车的欧洲中心分布、季节性模式及依赖少数活跃贡献者的特点，同时也存在人口统计偏差和不可验证条目等局限性。

Conclusion: 尽管数据集存在局限性，但仍为研究搭便车提供了宝贵资源。未来可通过丰富数据和研究方向进一步探索其作为交通方式和文化现象的意义。

Abstract: Hitchhiking, a spontaneous and decentralized mode of travel, has long eluded
systematic study due to its informal nature. This paper presents and analyzes
the largest known structured dataset of hitchhiking rides, comprising over
63,000 entries collected over nearly two decades through platforms associated
with hitchwiki.org and lately on hitchmap.com. By leveraging crowd-sourced
contributions, the dataset captures key spatiotemporal and strategic aspects of
hitchhiking. This work documents the dataset's origins, evolution, and
community-driven maintenance, highlighting its Europe-centric distribution,
seasonal patterns, and reliance on a small number of highly active
contributors. Through exploratory analyses, I examine waiting times, user
behavior, and comment metadata, shedding light on the lived realities of
hitchhikers. While the dataset has inherent biases and limitations - such as
demographic skew and unverifiable entries it offers a rare and valuable window
into an alternative form of mobility. I conclude by outlining future directions
for enriching the dataset and advancing research on hitchhiking as both a
transportation practice and cultural phenomenon.

*Abdulkareem Alsudais*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 分析arXiv.org上2010年至2024年6月7日的摘要，评估可读性变化，发现ChatGPT发布后显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）对科学写作可读性的潜在影响。

Method: 使用四种标准可读性公式计算每篇论文的可读性分数，按年份和学科分类分析。

Result: 摘要可读性逐年下降，ChatGPT发布后2023年和2024年变化显著，各学科趋势类似。

Conclusion: AI可能影响科学写作的可读性，导致摘要更复杂。

Abstract: The rise and growing popularity of accessible large language models have
raised questions about their impact on various aspects of life, including how
scientists write and publish their research. The primary objective of this
paper is to analyze a dataset consisting of all abstracts posted on arXiv.org
between 2010 and June 7th, 2024, to assess the evolution of their readability
and determine whether significant shifts occurred following the release of
ChatGPT in November 2022. Four standard readability formulas are used to
calculate individual readability scores for each paper, classifying their level
of readability. These scores are then aggregated by year and across the eight
primary categories covered by the platform. The results show a steady annual
decrease in readability, suggesting that abstracts are likely becoming
increasingly complex. Additionally, following the release of ChatGPT, a
significant change in readability is observed for 2023 and the analyzed months
of 2024. Similar trends are found across categories, with most experiencing a
notable change in readability during 2023 and 2024. These findings offer
insights into the broader changes in readability and point to the likely
influence of AI on scientific writing.

### [344] [Using Large Language Models to Suggest Informative Prior Distributions in Bayesian Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21964)
*Michael A. Riegler,Kristoffer Herland Hellton,Vajira Thambawita,Hugo L. Hammer*

Main category: stat.ME

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用大型语言模型（LLM）为贝叶斯统计选择先验分布的方法，评估了Claude、Gemini和ChatGPT在真实数据集上的表现，发现LLM在识别正确关联方面潜力巨大，但校准先验宽度仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贝叶斯统计中选择先验分布通常具有挑战性、资源密集且主观性强，研究旨在利用LLM提供基于知识的先验建议，以提高效率和客观性。

Method: 通过设计详细的提示词，要求LLM不仅建议先验分布，还验证和反思其选择，并在心脏疾病风险和混凝土强度两个真实数据集上评估Claude、Gemini和ChatGPT的表现。

Result: LLM能正确识别所有关联方向，但在先验分布的质量上存在差异：Claude和Gemini表现优于ChatGPT，后者在弱信息先验中表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLM在开发信息性先验方面潜力巨大，但需解决校准先验宽度以避免过度自信或不足的问题。

Abstract: Selecting prior distributions in Bayesian statistics is challenging,
resource-intensive, and subjective. We analyze using large-language models
(LLMs) to suggest suitable, knowledge-based informative priors. We developed an
extensive prompt asking LLMs not only to suggest priors but also to verify and
reflect on their choices.
  We evaluated Claude Opus, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and ChatGPT-4o-mini on two real
datasets: heart disease risk and concrete strength. All LLMs correctly
identified the direction for all associations (e.g., that heart disease risk is
higher for males). The quality of suggested priors was measured by their
Kullback-Leibler divergence from the maximum likelihood estimator's
distribution.
  The LLMs suggested both moderately and weakly informative priors. The
moderate priors were often overconfident, resulting in distributions misaligned
with the data. In our experiments, Claude and Gemini provided better priors
than ChatGPT. For weakly informative priors, a key performance difference
emerged: ChatGPT and Gemini defaulted to an "unnecessarily vague" mean of 0,
while Claude did not, demonstrating a significant advantage.
  The ability of LLMs to identify correct associations shows their great
potential as an efficient, objective method for developing informative priors.
However, the primary challenge remains in calibrating the width of these priors
to avoid over- and under-confidence.

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: FPGA加速的神经网络用于MRF数据的实时大脑参数重建，训练时间大幅缩短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPU训练神经网络耗时过长，影响实时性，FPGA方案可显著提升效率。

Method: 采用基于FPGA的神经网络，优化MRF数据的参数重建流程。

Result: 训练时间仅需200秒，比CPU快250倍，支持移动设备实时分析。

Conclusion: 该方法有望推动临床决策和远程医疗的革命性发展。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) is a fast quantitative MR Imaging
technique that provides multi-parametric maps with a single acquisition. Neural
Networks (NNs) accelerate reconstruction but require significant resources for
training. We propose an FPGA-based NN for real-time brain parameter
reconstruction from MRF data. Training the NN takes an estimated 200 seconds,
significantly faster than standard CPU-based training, which can be up to 250
times slower. This method could enable real-time brain analysis on mobile
devices, revolutionizing clinical decision-making and telemedicine.

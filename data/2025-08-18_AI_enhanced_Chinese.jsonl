Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most\nexisting approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support\npropositional rules.

Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial\nfor integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several\nprior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems\nto autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)\nthese approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization\nstep, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,\nand 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the\nUWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods\nin real-world scenarios.

To achieve this,\nexperience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally\nexpensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts\nhave been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most\ntime-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on\ntheory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and\nintegrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to\nautomatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning\ntime. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by\nlearning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we\nintegrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed\nfor LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability\nissue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop\nvirtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy\nnetwork, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The\ninner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based\non objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in\nthis study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves\nthe effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively.

More specifically, we study\ntwo prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from\nabstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the\nrespective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes\ncalled non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation\nframeworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the\nrelations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general\nnon-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been\nrecently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions\ncannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated\nfor ABA so far.

This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language\nexplanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and\nusability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including\nFreebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the\nogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1.

To systematically assess models' performance, we\nconduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and\nclarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an\nLLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human\nevaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,\nand human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth\ndatasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model.

However, their capacity for logical\nunderstanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical\n''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.\nTo systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories\nand 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical\ndiagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the\nstate-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,\nparticularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,\nhighlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical\nstructures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training\nframework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in\nboth data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes\nlogic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines\ncoarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel\nlogical structure-aware objective.

To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several\ncontinual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to\nefficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining\nlearned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world\nscenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of\nupdates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In\nthis paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for\nCKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on\nthe update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic\nDistillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of\nlearned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform\nlightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID\nimages.

Most prior approaches rely on\nexplicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their\ngeneralization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the\nability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising\nalternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low\nsignal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and\nmillimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment.

These studies pose great challenges to the\ntraditional statistical methods (e.g., single-locus analyses based on\nregression methods) because of the high-dimensionality of data and the low\nfrequency of genetic variants. In addition, there is a great interest in\nbiology and epidemiology to identify genetic risk factors contributed to\nmultiple disease phenotypes. The multiple phenotypes can often follow different\ndistributions, which violates the assumptions of most current methods. In this\npaper, we propose a generalized similarity U test, referred to as GSU.

MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework\nfor LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning\ndaily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer\npairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise\ndata extraction), multiple-choice reasoning (semantic inference), and free-form\nexplanation (interpretive description), which all require spatial, temporal,\nand semantic reasoning. Our evaluation of major LLMs reveals strong performance\non factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and\nexplanation question answering, with trajectory length substantially impacting\nmodel effectiveness.

In contradistinction to traditional adversarial\nexamples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the\nmalfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation\n(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more\nefficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack\nperformance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation\nstudies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial\ntraining results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that\neffectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,\nIPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for\nconstructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced\nreasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of\nthis study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization\nnot only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such\nas autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models\nmust remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u589e\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\uff08IPG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb11.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eIPG\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIPG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408YOLO\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "IPG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "IPG\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u5b89\u9632\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Converging evidence shows that genetic\nvariants with low marginal effects (LME) play an important role in disease\ndevelopment. Despite their potential significance, discovering LME genetic\nvariants and assessing their joint association on high dimensional data (e.g.,\ngenome wide association studies) remain a great challenge. To facilitate joint\nassociation analysis among a large ensemble of LME genetic variants, we\nproposed a computationally efficient and powerful approach, which we call Trees\nAssembling Mann whitney (TAMW). Through simulation studies and an empirical\ndata application, we found that TAMW outperformed multifactor dimensionality\nreduction (MDR) and the likelihood ratio based Mann whitney approach (LRMW)\nwhen the underlying complex disease involves multiple LME loci and their\ninteractions. For instance, in a simulation with 20 interacting LME loci, TAMW\nattained a higher power (power=0.931) than both MDR (power=0.599) and LRMW\n(power=0.704). In an empirical study of 29 known Crohn's disease (CD) loci,\nTAMW also identified a stronger joint association with CD than those detected\nby MDR and LRMW. Finally, we applied TAMW to Wellcome Trust CD GWAS to conduct\na genome wide analysis. The analysis of 459K single nucleotide polymorphisms\nwas completed in 40 hours using parallel computing, and revealed a joint\nassociation predisposing to CD (p-value=2.763e-19). Further analysis of the\nnewly discovered association suggested that 13 genes, such as ATG16L1 and\nLACC1, may play an important role in CD pathophysiological and etiological\nprocesses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTAMW\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u5e94\uff08LME\uff09\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5MDR\u548cLRMW\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u8fb9\u9645\u6548\u5e94\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75be\u75c5\u4e2d\u8d77\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8054\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAMW\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "TAMW\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u514b\u7f57\u6069\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eMDR\u548cLRMW\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "TAMW\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790LME\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u514b\u7f57\u6069\u75c5\u7684\u65b0\u81f4\u75c5\u57fa\u56e0\u3002"}}

However, both the encoding\nand decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing\nto exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a\nframework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive\nlearning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate\nsystems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the\npotential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore\nmultiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA,\ncompressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u538b\u7f29\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u538b\u7f29\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u538b\u7f29PCA\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u7b49\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u538b\u7f29\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faEvoPSF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEvoPSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEvoPSF\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u548c\u635f\u574f\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoPSF\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency.

Oftentimes, students engaged in long\nthreads that showed misalignment between their prompts and AI output that\nexemplified a lack of synergy that challenges the prevailing assumptions about\nLLMs as collaborative partners. We also found no significant correlations\nbetween assignment complexity, prompt length, and student grades suggesting a\nlack of cognitive depth, or effect of problem difficulty. Our study indicates\nthat the current LLMs, optimized for instruction-following rather than\ncognitive partnership, compound their capability to act as cognitively\nstimulating or aligned collaborators.

With AI, we can now extract detailed\nmeasurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D\nclinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define\nbody composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using\nlarge-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms\nabdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through\nsegmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random\nforest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection\nthrough SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns\n(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences\n(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of\n14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05).

To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction\nmodel based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in\ntime series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial\narea in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5\nconcentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,\nand precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over\n6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean\nsquare error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in\nboth accuracy and generalization.

To address these issues, this paper presents a novel\ncross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the\nMulti-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).\nSpecifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic\nembeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive\npretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product\nsimilarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is\nintroduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,\nguided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck\nprinciple, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance\nmatrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches.

In this work, we revisit\nthe adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,\ntreating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete\ntimesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored\nchallenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency\nfor adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training\nframework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the\ntemporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both\nobjectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for\nefficient optimization.

With a\nprevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive\nhealth. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,\npelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding\ntreatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and\nanatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a\nnon-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians\nfor the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a\nprecise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including\nmeasurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is\nlabor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra-\nand inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a\nresult, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation\nmethod for uterine fibroids.

Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from\nlow-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and\nquantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,\nwhich aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and\nimage levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and\nsimilarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further\nenhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in\nsource-free remote sensing detection tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VG-DETR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFM\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e90\u57df\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u56e0\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u9650\u5236\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SFOD\uff09\u56e0\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002VG-DETR\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u6807\u6ce8\u548cVFM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "VG-DETR\u7ed3\u5408VFM\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6316\u6398\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u524d\u8005\u5229\u7528VFM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVG-DETR\u5728\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u8fdc\u7a0b\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "VG-DETR\u901a\u8fc7VFM\u548c\u53cc\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6e90\u81ea\u7531\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For IR, we employ a\ncontrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by\ncross-device sampling.

Building on research on fairness and\ndiscrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --\ndiscrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human\nanimals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)\nSpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral\nevaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures\ncomparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation\ntasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In\nour benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely\ncondemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On\npsychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower\nexplicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose\nto save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that\nLLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities\nwere equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described\nas more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In\nopen-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized\nharm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.\nThese findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and\nmainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms\naround animal exploitation.

However, their performance often\ndegrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features\nhigh resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.\nThese challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured\naerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a\nlightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained\nusing a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nmulti-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning\nthrough rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question\nanswering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples\ncovering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,\ntransportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results\nshow that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the\nQwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which\nis 36x larger, on multiple tasks.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly.

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference.

Based on an\nanalysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular\nlevels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD.

We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,\nproviding empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient\nlearning process.

However, existing methods for CBT learning\nsuch as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are\nhindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due\nto their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive\nfocus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the\ngenerated CBT.

By\nintegrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO\ncaptures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process\ninformation and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a\ncomputationally efficient manner.

However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for\nsimple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which\nassumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an\nexplanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an\nexplanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of\nplausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular\nexplanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision\nfunctions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it\nshould be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which\ndifferent explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger\nthan what one might expect.

In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be\ncomputed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the\ntraining dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training\nsuch as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite\nwidth effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian\nstatistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing\nfinite-width corrections to NTK statistics.

This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing\ngeometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant\nobjects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address\nthis, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable\nspatial patterns over time.

Secondly, our\ncue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature\nrepresentations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a\ndynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for\nstable online tracking.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise.

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories.

Starting with a seed set of 16 hand-crafted realistic tasks, each\nfeaturing one of 8 cognitive biases (e.g., anchoring, framing) and\ncorresponding unbiased variants, we test whether bias-inducing linguistic cues\nunrelated to task logic can lead GPAI systems from correct to incorrect\nconclusions.\n  To scale the benchmark and ensure realism, we develop an on-demand\naugmentation pipeline relying on GPAI systems to generate task variants that\npreserve bias-inducing cues while varying surface details. This pipeline\nensures correctness (88--99% on average, according to human evaluation),\npromotes diversity, and controls reasoning complexity by leveraging\nProlog-based reasoning and LLM-as-a-judge validation. It also verifies that the\nembedded biases are both harmful and undetectable by logic-based, unbiased\nreasoners.\n  We evaluate leading GPAI systems (GPT, LLaMA, DeepSeek) and find a consistent\ntendency to rely on shallow linguistic heuristics over deep reasoning.

Remarkably, when f_{\\phi}(x) performs satisfactorily,\nY|f_{\\phi}(x) closely approximates Y|X. Theoretically, we deduce the stochastic\ndifferential equations of CARD and establish its generalized form predicated on\nthe Fokker-Planck equation, thereby erecting a firm theoretical foundation for\nanalysis.

To\novercome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes\nhighly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized\nenhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)\nand aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state\ninteraction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while\nincurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking\nrobustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple\nstate representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE\nrefines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates\ninformation exchange between these states and ensures the integration of\ncomplementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a\nhighly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)\ndesign, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient\ntrackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy\nand robustness.

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in\naction spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action\ncategories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.\nAdditionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications\nbased on TrajSV.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrajSV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrajSV\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001CRNet\u548cVRNet\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u589e\u5f3aTransformer\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u91cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8db3\u7403\u3001\u7bee\u7403\u548c\u6392\u7403\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTrajSV\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd170%\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u572817\u7c7b\u4e2d9\u7c7b\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u5b57\u5e55\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSV\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the\nTP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when\nreceiving METH-related image cues.

Surprisingly, we find that removing or\nmodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of\ntemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model.

Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation.

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition.

In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision.

Unlike\ntraditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the\ndrift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data\nwithout strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in\nscientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly\ncomplex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized\nnegative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory\nsegments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte\nCarlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte\nCarlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized\nempirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a\nfinite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer\ntheorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a\nhybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify\nsignificant coefficients in the kernel expansion.

However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a\nsignificant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow\nimages that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or\ndevice-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where\nthe objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity\nfield, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed\nnoisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two\nsubproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem\nleverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field\nfrom noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims\nto infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping\nthat deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an\nalternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field\nand the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality\nreconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through\nexperiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under\nvarying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic\ngeometry with signal-dependent noise.

In real-world scenarios, observed\nsatellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment\nand environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on\nenhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing\nnoise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,\nleading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces\ntwo key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and\nTemporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization\nfunction that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural\ndetails, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a\nnearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally\nadjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST\nfusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,\nand develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual\nsplitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs\ncomparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and\noutperforms them under noisy conditions.

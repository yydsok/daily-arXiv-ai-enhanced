Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation\ncaused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We\nexplore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the\nproduction of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We\ncreated artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and\nstudied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal\nthat media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but\nnot always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information\nprovided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either\naccessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception\nand holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator\n-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight."}

Our findings reveal a consistent degradation in SV\nperformance across all models and codecs as bitrates decrease. Notably, NACs do\nnot fundamentally break SV performance when compared to traditional codecs.\nThey outperform Opus by 6-8% at low-bitrates (< 12 kbps) and remain marginally\nbehind at higher bitrates ($\\approx$ 24 kbps), with an EER increase of only\n0.4-0.7%.

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that\nunder certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which\nwe refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges.

Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment\nassumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic\nSLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic\nfeatures, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point\nfeatures for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by\ncontinuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point\nfeatures, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current\nmethods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,\ncausing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential\nperformance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and\nnoise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism\nthat evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line\nfeature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system\nto introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity of additional features while minimizing the\nintroduction of low-quality features and noise.

We (1) formalize a principled\ntaxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical\nconstraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;\n(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with\n2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)\nANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model\nthat decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our\nevaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates\nexceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and\nadaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical\nrobot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly\nconsequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent\nneed for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era.

However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds\nwatermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied\nto outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without\nneeding access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed\nunique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on\npost-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an\nensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of\nattack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains\nto investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the\nwatermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack\nnetwork in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the\nfrequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.\nExtensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the\nmetric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances\nthe robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests.

Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing\nsynthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing\nvariation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of\nconfounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide\npoint estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed\nestimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the\nsource data).

This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}

We conducted workshops with three\ncommunities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of\nthe public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,\nand 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.\nIn the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot\nCo-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with\nThematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our\nanalysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical\nquestions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'\ninsights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in\nlight of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future\ninvestigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that\nroboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in\norder to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic\napplications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase.

In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically.

Although it is\nrelatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping\nof inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely\nunexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may\nfocus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that\nbelong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an\nexplicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named\nTopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features\nthat characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the\nspecific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain\ninput embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might\nrequire specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a\nmeaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel\nway to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering\ntechniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human\nevaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based\non the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically\nselect the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are\nproduced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation\nresults show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and\nmeaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using\nmutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our\ntopographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.\nExperimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%\non average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones."}

Using a cross-case\nanalysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along\ntwo independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental\nto transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to\namplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:\nindividual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less\ndeployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first\nthree reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable\nvalue capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:\ncomplementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution\n(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human\ndetermination of ethical and strategic parameters).

While the outsourcing of human\ndecision-making to AI can be both efficient and effective, it raises a\nfundamental question: how does delegating identity-defining choices to AI\nreshape who people become? We study the impact of agentic LLMs on two\nidentity-relevant outcomes: interpersonal distinctiveness - how unique a\nperson's choices are relative to others - and intrapersonal diversity - the\nbreadth of a single person's choices over time. Using real choices drawn from\nsocial-media behavior of 1,000 U.S. users (110,000 choices in total), we\ncompare a generic and personalized agent to a human baseline. Both agents shift\npeople's choices toward more popular options, reducing the distinctiveness of\ntheir behaviors and preferences. While the use of personalized agents tempers\nthis homogenization (compared to the generic AI), it also more strongly\ncompresses the diversity of people's preference portfolios by narrowing what\nthey explore across topics and psychological affinities.

Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control\nparadigms are ``choose phase\" and ``switch\" strategies. Although the agent in\nthe choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this\nparadigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their\nanticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,\nthe switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next\npredefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a\nmore predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase\nallocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while\nothers are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep\nHierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle\nduration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the\ntotal cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions\nbased on the overall traffic state.

This enhances the\nmodel's ability to differentiate benign from malignant lesions in imbalanced\nand heterogeneous clinical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nMST+KAN pipeline outperforms the baseline MST classifier, achieving AUC = 0.80\n\\pm 0.02 while preserving interpretability through attention-based heatmaps.\nOur findings highlight the effectiveness of combining foundation model\nembeddings with advanced classification strategies for building robust and\ngeneralizable breast MRI analysis tools."}

We introduce a\npatch-based training pipeline that selectively injects synthetic patches\ngenerated from the learned latent space, and systematically study the effects\nof varying synthetic-to-real patch ratios during training. To further enhance\noutput fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss\nusing VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial\nsupervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset\ndemonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in\nboundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.\nOur findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative\ntraining regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into\nbalancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce\nscenarios."}

A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise \\textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}\ntechniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a\nnovel calculus, called \\textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation\ntransformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \\textit{source}\nrepresentation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us\nto generate a \\textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of\nstructure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source\nrepresentation and the generated target representation satisfy \\textit{any}\nspecified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting\n\\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can\nexpress \\textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair\nof RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure\nfor the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We\nformalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\\cite{raggi2022rst},\nbuilding on the key concept of a \\textit{construction space}. The abstract\nnature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of\ndiverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as\nwell as informal notations.

To\ntackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively\nextract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training\nload and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key\nstrategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental\nSelection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general\nweather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing\ndiverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base\nmodel. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under\nchallenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and\nprediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the\nmodel to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios.

This paper introduces\nHyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a\ndata-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into\nanomaly detection.

The third\ncontribution is to develop a novel protocol to efficiently measure AC-PF\nquantum observables by exploiting the graph structure of a power network.\nPreliminary numerical tests indicate that the proposed VQC models attain\nenhanced prediction performance over a deep neural network despite using much\nfewer weights. The proposed quantum AC-PF framework sets the foundations for\naddressing more elaborate grid tasks via quantum computing."}

For more information, please visit our\n  project website: https://strefer.github.io/", "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs."}

A Validation Study with Naturalistic Trajectories", "categories": ["cs.RO", "cs.AI", "cs.LG", "cs.SY", "eess.SY", "stat.AP"], "comment": null, "summary": "The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for\ndata-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its\nvalidity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary\npost-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of\ntrajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately\ncaptures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.\nLeveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV\noperations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across\nthree representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized\nintersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging\nanalysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure\nnegligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we\napply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically\nestimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to\nquantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show\nthat behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,\nWOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings\nsuggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically\nunderestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.\nCaution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without\nproper validation against independently collected data."}

A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly\nalarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image,\nwithout requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial\nand vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass\nindustry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and\nMicrosoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are\nfar easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering\nthe barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core\nresearch questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors\nreliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and\n(RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection\nwithout overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators\nsuch as SpeechT5.\n  Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic\nevaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail\nunder both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted\nfine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding\nsignificant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after\nfine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and\nrobustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental\nweaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training\nprotocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection."}

Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This\npaper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical\ntestbed for CRL."}

To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:\n\"Learning Not to be\" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'\ntarget-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak\nmodality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and\npreserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve\nunique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal\nlearning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal\nNegative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance\nmechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the\nrobustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal\nConfidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,\nparticularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios.

Classical models of shift bribery assume voters\nact independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in\nreality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a\nsocial network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby\namplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks,\nwhere voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs\nrepresent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not\nconfined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the\nnetwork, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and\nindividual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a\ndesignated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists\nwithin budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and\nnetwork-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is\nNP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when\nparameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design\npolynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority\nrules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for\ntransitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform\narc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs.

In this work, we present\nCDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset\nfocused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes\n5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive\ninformation such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and\ndischarge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several\nstate-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication\nrecommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised\nfine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for\nimprovement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard\nscore of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug\nrecommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable\nresource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.\nThe dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data\nusage agreements at https://github.com/DUTIR-BioNLP/CDrugRed."}

Humans, in contrast, actively explore and\ninteract with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to\ngather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,\nreasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the\nActive Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially\nobservable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively\nacquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations\nacross multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust\ndecisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we\nintroduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive\nenvironments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and\ninformation-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset\nthat offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative\nreasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain\nprediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training\nagents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop\nPhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,\nembodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,\nGeometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite\ndetecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and\nintegrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap\nin active reasoning capabilities."}

Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)\naddress this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture\ninter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable\nparameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio\nsignals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the\noverhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and\nreduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for\ndeployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this\nstudy explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the\ncomputational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance.

Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical\nproperties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,\nsynthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these\ndemonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded\nwith physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the\nphysical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions\nfor various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel\ninteractions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while\nenabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art\nmethod, i.e., PhysTwin."}

However,\nthese models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in\nresponses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address\ntransparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI\napproaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are\nnot well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a\nlimited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively\nintegrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing\nestablished NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic\nintegration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with\nLLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four\ndimensions by organising existing literature within these categories.

The reference model achieves approximately 13x the\npermutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of\nthe task.

CAMV\nreformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted\nfalsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among\nexpert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification\ncost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability.\nTRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents\nthrough a structured facts module.

These adapters are typically trained to\ncapture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using\nsingle-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image\ninevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle\nthe target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and\nlighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs\nthe model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we\nuncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to\neliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,\nconfounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or\nLoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The\nauxiliary modules are then removed during inference.

In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that\nintegrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first\nconstruct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired\nwith over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large\nscale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a\npretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to\ntrain fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the\nfine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption\nregression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in\nthe pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision\nfeature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further\nincorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization\nconstraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning\ncapability.

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist).

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal.

In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform\nvertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies\nuniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity\nparameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is\nthe characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which\nprovides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM\nand DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional\nedge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity\ncoefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity\ncaptured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity\npatterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge\ndensities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected\nadjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of\nclusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors\nmay fail to capture important structural information.

CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in\ntypicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating\nfrom learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation\n(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and\nachieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived\noriginality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our\nmethod produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space\nthan its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness\ncan unlock creative potential in autonomous agents."}

Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework.

We seek to address this challenge by\napplying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document\nlimitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from\nGlacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor\nseals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping\n(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),\nand perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes\nrelevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution\nregions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)\nfaithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector\nconfidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal\nsystematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours\nrather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection\nconfidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also\nuncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black\nice and rocks.

Any single test applied uniformly across the\npopulation yields statistical error that is sub-optimal relative to the\nperformance of an oracle given access to the private information.

Our main result fully characterizes the collection of all\nseparating menus that are instance-adaptive, matching oracle performance for an\narbitrary population of heterogeneous agents. We identify designs where\ninformation elicitation is essentially costless, requiring negligible\nadditional expense relative to a single-test benchmark, while improving\nstatistical performance.

The existing literature on multivariate\ncalibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions,\nwhich are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to\nunivariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work,\nwe go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to\nenforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank\nfunctions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest\ndensity region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces\ncalibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral\ntransforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a\nregularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor.\nSpecifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both\nmarginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration.

This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic\nhuman activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach\ncan generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language\ndescriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.\nWe process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training\ndataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames.

Recent findings reveal that,\neven when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations\ncan change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift.\nStudying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift\nis essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a\nsystematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the\nconnection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we\ncharacterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show\nthat the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent\nlearns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the\nrepresentation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we\ndemonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and\nSimilarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to\nautoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that\nthe drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the\ntask-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different\nqualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than\nthose arising from Gaussian synaptic noise.

To appear in Advances in Neural Processing\n  Information Systems (NeurIPS), 2025", "summary": "We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for\nblack-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a\nweighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is\nproportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can\nmodel distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them\nfor BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do\nthis by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with\nauxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a\nFeynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field\ntheory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case,\n$t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial\nlatent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples\nwhich BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density.\nGiven a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the\nexponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each\niteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match\nthe scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn\nfrom the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic\nprogram, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge\nexponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by\nevaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target\ndistributions."}

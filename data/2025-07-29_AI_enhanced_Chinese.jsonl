As an important tool for studying\ncomplex systems, computational experiments can map them into artificial society\nmodels that are computable and reproducible within computers, thereby providing\ndigital and computational methods for quantitative analysis. In current\nresearch, the construction of individual agent models often ignores the\nlong-term accumulative effect of memory mechanisms in the development process\nof agents, which to some extent causes the constructed models to deviate from\nthe real characteristics of real-world systems. To address this challenge, this\npaper proposes an individual agent model based on a memory-learning\ncollaboration mechanism, which implements hierarchical modeling of the memory\nmechanism and a multi-indicator evaluation mechanism. Through hierarchical\nmodeling of the individual memory repository, the group memory repository, and\nthe memory buffer pool, memory can be effectively managed, and knowledge\nsharing and dissemination between individuals and groups can be promoted.

This underrepresentation is revealed in\nthis study by a comparative analysis of GPS and survey data, highlighting stark\ndifferences between the bimodal temporal patterns of shift workers and the\nconventional 9-to-5 schedules recorded in surveys. To address this bias, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based approach that leverages fragmented GPS\ntrajectory data to generate complete, behaviorally valid activity patterns for\nindividuals working non-standard hours.

We\nsystematically design and assess three structured reward strategies: goal-only\nreward (GOR), dense proximity reward (DPR), and milestone-augmented reward\n(MAR), each integrated with both on-policy and off-policy optimization\nparadigms. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the on-policy MAR achieves a\n91\\% success rate, yielding smoother trajectories and more robust behavior,\nwhile GOR and DPR fail to guide effective learning. Convergence and trajectory\nanalyses demonstrate that the proposed framework enhances policy adaptability,\naccelerates training, and improves safety in continuous control.

To address\nthese issues, we introduce a novel Reinforced Multimodal Distillation\nframework, exploiting the Dark Side of Modalities (DSoM) from two perspectives:\n(1) Dark knowledge from non-target entities: We propose to train a unimodal KGR\nmodel through logit distillation to mimic the multimodal soft labels provided\nby pre-trained multimodal teacher models. The multimodal soft labels could\nprovide rich supervision signals with subtle correlations among both target and\nnon-target entities from multiple perspectives. We further decouple logits into\nneighbor entities and non-neighbor entities to divide into two types of\ncorrelations.

The agent is trained to maximize the rewards, which are only\nassigned to the beneficial multimodal combination strategies for the student\nmodel.

To overcome these limitations, researchers\nhave proposed extensions that incorporate models of cognitive constraints,\nsubjective beliefs, and heterogeneous reasoning. Among these, hypergame theory\nextends the classical paradigm by explicitly modeling agents' subjective\nperceptions of the strategic scenario, known as perceptual games, in which\nagents may hold divergent beliefs about the structure, payoffs, or available\nactions. We present a systematic review of agent-compatible applications of\nhypergame theory, examining how its descriptive capabilities have been adapted\nto dynamic and interactive MAS contexts. We analyze 44 selected studies from\ncybersecurity, robotics, social simulation, communications, and general\ngame-theoretic modeling. Building on a formal introduction to hypergame theory\nand its two major extensions - hierarchical hypergames and HNF - we develop\nagent-compatibility criteria and an agent-based classification framework to\nassess integration patterns and practical applicability. Our analysis reveals\nprevailing tendencies, including the prevalence of hierarchical and graph-based\nmodels in deceptive reasoning and the simplification of extensive theoretical\nframeworks in practical applications. We identify structural gaps, including\nthe limited adoption of HNF-based models, the lack of formal hypergame\nlanguages, and unexplored opportunities for modeling human-agent and\nagent-agent misalignment.

Despite the threats to voice privacy,\nresearch to selectively remove the knowledge to replicate unwanted individual\nvoices from pre-trained model parameters has not been explored. In this paper,\nwe address the new challenge of speaker identity unlearning for ZS-TTS systems.\nTo meet this goal, we propose the first machine unlearning frameworks for\nZS-TTS, especially Teacher-Guided Unlearning (TGU), designed to ensure the\nmodel forgets designated speaker identities while retaining its ability to\ngenerate accurate speech for other speakers. Our proposed methods incorporate\nrandomness to prevent consistent replication of forget speakers' voices,\nassuring unlearned identities remain untraceable. Additionally, we propose a\nnew evaluation metric, speaker-Zero Retrain Forgetting (spk-ZRF).

Existing detection methods that\nrely on a single modality, either raw waveform embeddings or spectral based\nfeatures, are vulnerable to non spoof disturbances and often overfit to known\nforgery algorithms, resulting in poor generalization to unseen attacks. To\naddress these shortcomings, we investigate hybrid fusion frameworks that\nintegrate self supervised learning (SSL) based representations with handcrafted\nspectral descriptors (MFCC , LFCC, CQCC). By aligning and combining\ncomplementary information across modalities, these fusion approaches capture\nsubtle artifacts that single feature approaches typically overlook. We explore\nseveral fusion strategies, including simple concatenation, cross attention,\nmutual cross attention, and a learnable gating mechanism, to optimally blend\nSSL features with fine grained spectral cues.

To quantitatively evaluate how well the generated dances match\nboth musical and choreographic styles, we introduce two new metrics that\nmeasure alignment with the intended stylistic cues.

The skin sensors employed in this study\npossess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple\ncontact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is\nanticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions\nexhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot\nmotion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by\naltering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this\npaper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing\nrecurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success\nof this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for\nsoftware-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive\nencoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy\nand learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to\nthe classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to\nmount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the\nactivation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of\nmeasuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation\nwith other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated\nby the robot's movements during deployment.

To address this issue, transfer learning (TL),\ncan be used to leverage information across related domains. An important\nconsideration is that the lack of labels in the target domain limits data-based\nmetrics to quantifying the discrepancy between the marginal distributions.\nThus, a prerequisite for the application of typical unsupervised TL methods is\nto identify suitable source structures (domains), and a set of features, for\nwhich the conditional distributions are related to the target structure.\nGenerally, the selection of domains and features is reliant on domain\nexpertise; however, for complex mechanisms, such as the influence of damage on\nthe dynamic response of a structure, this task is not trivial. In this paper,\nknowledge of physics is leveraged to select more similar features, the modal\nassurance criterion (MAC) is used to quantify the correspondence between the\nmodes of healthy structures. The MAC is shown to have high correspondence with\na supervised metric that measures joint-distribution similarity, which is the\nprimary indicator of whether a classifier will generalise between domains. The\nMAC is proposed as a measure for selecting a set of features that behave\nconsistently across domains when subjected to damage, i.e. features with\ninvariance in the conditional distributions.

In this paper, we investigate label-efficient semi-supervised\nfine-tuning strategies for compact VLMs (2B-3B parameters) that leverage\nunlabeled product listings through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nBeginning with a small, API-based, annotated, and labeled set, we first employ\nPEFT to train low-rank adapter modules. To update the adapter weights with\nunlabeled data, we generate multiple reasoning-and-answer chains per unlabeled\nsample and segregate these chains into preferred and dispreferred based on\nself-consistency. We then fine-tune the model with DPO loss and use the updated\nmodel for the next iteration. By using PEFT fine-tuning with DPO, our method\nachieves efficient convergence with minimal compute overhead. On a dataset\nspanning twelve e-commerce verticals, DPO-based fine-tuning, which utilizes\nonly unlabeled data, demonstrates a significant improvement over the supervised\nmodel.

We also\npropose a rolling data release policy with user privacy guarantees, providing a\nrenewable source of preference data and increasing platform transparency.\nThrough its standardized evaluation protocol, transparent data access policies,\nand music-specific features, Music Arena not only addresses key challenges in\nthe TTM ecosystem but also demonstrates how live evaluation can be thoughtfully\nadapted to unique characteristics of specific AI domains.\n  Music Arena is available at: https://music-arena.org", "AI": {"tldr": "Music Arena\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u4e50\uff08TTM\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u97f3\u4e50\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3TTM\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2aTTM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8be6\u7ec6\u504f\u597d\u6536\u96c6\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6570\u636e\u8bbf\u95ee\u653f\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3aTTM\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "Music Arena\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86TTM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u4ed6AI\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Our\nframework replaces a single opaque reward with five *structurally separate*\nutility heads -- deference, switch-access preservation, truthfulness,\nlow-impact behavior via a belief-based extension of Attainable Utility\nPreservation, and bounded task reward -- combined lexicographically by strict\nweight gaps. Theorem 1 proves exact single-round corrigibility in the partially\nobservable off-switch game; Theorem 3 extends the guarantee to multi-step,\nself-spawning agents, showing that even if each head is \\emph{learned} to\nmean-squared error $\\varepsilon$ and the planner is $\\varepsilon$-sub-optimal,\nthe probability of violating \\emph{any} safety property is bounded while still\nensuring net human benefit. In contrast to Constitutional AI or RLHF/RLAIF,\nwhich merge all norms into one learned scalar, our separation makes obedience\nand impact-limits dominate even when incentives conflict. For open-ended\nsettings where adversaries can modify the agent, we prove that deciding whether\nan arbitrary post-hack agent will ever violate corrigibility is undecidable by\nreduction to the halting problem, then carve out a finite-horizon ``decidable\nisland'' where safety can be certified in randomized polynomial time and\nverified with privacy-preserving, constant-round zero-knowledge proofs.\nConsequently, the remaining challenge is the ordinary ML task of data coverage\nand generalization: reward-hacking risk is pushed into evaluation quality\nrather than hidden incentive leak-through, giving clearer implementation\nguidance for today's LLM assistants and future autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5934\uff08\u5982\u987a\u4ece\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u5173\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fdd\u62a4\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Constitutional AI\u6216RLHF/RLAIF\uff09\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u89c4\u8303\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u91cf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u79bb\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u95f4\u9699\u8fdb\u884c\u8bcd\u5178\u5f0f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u98ce\u9669\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524dLLM\u52a9\u624b\u548c\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Hence, we propose\nReSoRA, a method that explicitly models redundancy between mapping subspaces\nand adaptively Regularizes Subspace redundancy of Low-Rank Adaptation.\nSpecifically, it theoretically decomposes the low-rank submatrices into\nmultiple equivalent subspaces and systematically applies de-redundancy\nconstraints to the feature distributions across different projections.\nExtensive experiments validate that our proposed method consistently\nfacilitates existing state-of-the-art PETL methods across various backbones and\ndatasets in vision-language retrieval and standard visual classification\nbenchmarks. Besides, as a training supervision, ReSoRA can be seamlessly\nintegrated into existing approaches in a plug-and-play manner, with no\nadditional inference costs.

To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning.

Two open-source LLMs were fine-tuned using QLoRA on GPT-4o-generated\nCoT data. Features were mapped to risk categories per institutional guideline\nbased on the 2017 ACR White Paper. Evaluation was performed on 285 held-out\nhuman-annotated reports. Model outputs for 100 cases were independently\nreviewed by three radiologists. Feature extraction was evaluated using exact\nmatch accuracy, risk categorization with macro-averaged F1 score, and\nradiologist-model agreement with Fleiss' Kappa. Results: CoT fine-tuning\nimproved feature extraction accuracy for LLaMA (80% to 97%) and DeepSeek (79%\nto 98%), matching GPT-4o (97%). Risk categorization F1 scores also improved\n(LLaMA: 0.95; DeepSeek: 0.94), closely matching GPT-4o (0.97), with no\nstatistically significant differences. Radiologist inter-reader agreement was\nhigh (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.888) and showed no statistically significant difference\nwith the addition of DeepSeek-FT-CoT (Fleiss' Kappa = 0.893) or GPT-CoT\n(Fleiss' Kappa = 0.897), indicating that both models achieved agreement levels\non par with radiologists. Conclusion: Fine-tuned open-source LLMs with CoT\nsupervision enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient phenotyping for\nlarge-scale PCL research, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4eceMRI/CT\u62a5\u544a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u80f0\u817a\u56ca\u6027\u75c5\u53d8\uff08PCL\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eGPT-4o\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u63d0\u53d6PCL\u7279\u5f81\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGPT-4o\u751f\u6210\u7684CoT\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03LLaMA\u548cDeepSeek\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6309\u6307\u5357\u5206\u7c7b\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe97%-98%\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u7c7bF1\u5206\u65700.94-0.95\uff0c\u4e0e\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u5f00\u6e90LLM\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684PCL\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eGPT-4o\u76f8\u5f53\u3002"}}

While existing methods focus on\ndetecting face retouching, how to accurately recover the original faces from\nthe retouched ones has yet to be answered. This paper introduces Face\nRetouching Restoration (FRR), a novel computer vision task aimed at restoring\noriginal faces from their retouched counterparts. FRR differs from traditional\nimage restoration tasks by addressing the complex retouching operations with\nvarious types and degrees, which focuses more on the restoration of the\nlow-frequency information of the faces. To tackle this challenge, we propose\nMoFRR, Mixture of Diffusion Models for FRR.

To mitigate\nthese challenges, this paper introduces the Federated Dynamic Prompt Generator\n(FedDPG), which incorporates a dynamic prompt generator network to generate\ncontext-aware prompts based on the given input, ensuring flexibility and\nadaptability while prioritising data privacy in federated learning settings.\nOur experiments on three NLP benchmark datasets showcase that FedDPG\noutperforms the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in\nterms of global model performance, and has significantly reduced the\ncalculation time and the number of parameters to be sent through the FL\nnetwork.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedDPG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aNLP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFedDPG\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDPG\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684NLP\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, it often produces\nbrittle and unstable policies, leading to critical failures such as spurious\nreasoning, deceptive alignment, and instruction disobedience that undermine the\ntrustworthiness and safety of LLMs/LRMs. Currently, these issues lack a unified\ntheoretical explanation and are typically addressed using ad-hoc heuristics.\nThis paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing the\nstability of the mapping from a reward function to the optimal policy. We show\nthat policy brittleness often stems from non-unique optimal actions, a common\noccurrence when multiple valid traces exist in a reasoning task. This\ntheoretical lens provides a unified explanation for a range of seemingly\ndisparate failures, reframing them as rational outcomes of optimizing rewards\nthat may be incomplete or noisy, especially in the presence of action\ndegeneracy.

Unlike conventional software or static\ninference, agentic workloads are dynamic and structurally complex. Often these\nagents are directed graphs of compute and IO operations that span multi-modal\ndata input and conversion), data processing and context gathering (e.g vector\nDB lookups), multiple LLM inferences, tool calls, etc. To scale AI agent usage,\nwe need efficient and scalable deployment and agent-serving infrastructure.\n  To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we present a system design for\ndynamic orchestration of AI agent workloads on heterogeneous compute\ninfrastructure spanning CPUs and accelerators, both from different vendors and\nacross different performance tiers within a single vendor. The system delivers\nseveral building blocks: a framework for planning and optimizing agentic AI\nexecution graphs using cost models that account for compute, memory, and\nbandwidth constraints of different HW; a MLIR based representation and\ncompilation system that can decompose AI agent execution graphs into granular\noperators and generate code for different HW options; and a dynamic\norchestration system that can place the granular components across a\nheterogeneous compute infrastructure and stitch them together while meeting an\nend-to-end SLA. Our design performs a systems level TCO optimization and\npreliminary results show that leveraging a heterogeneous infrastructure can\ndeliver significant TCO benefits.

To address\ninter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained\nincreasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal\nimaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation\nmethod within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib\nstructures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone\nsurface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related\nsignals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic\nnoise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,\nthe sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a\ndenser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an\nimage-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping\nfor individual patients. Additionally, to ensure full coverage of the object of\ninterest, we introduce an automated tilt angle adjustment method to visualize\nstructures beneath the bone.

In\nthis work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion,\nfrom which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches.\nIn particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object\nlocalization, which however can provide initial seeds.

Accurate, fine-scale mapping of flood extents and recovery\ntrajectories is therefore essential for improving emergency response and\nresilience planning. However, arid environments often exhibit limited spectral\ncontrast between water and adjacent surfaces, rapid hydrological dynamics, and\nhighly heterogeneous urban land covers, which challenge traditional\nflood-mapping approaches.

In this work, we introduce FM-LC, a\nhierarchical framework for Flood Mapping by Land Cover identification, for this\nchallenging task. Through a three-stage process, it first uses an initial\nmulti-class U-Net to segment imagery into water, vegetation, built area, and\nbare ground classes. We identify that this method has confusion between\nspectrally similar categories (e.g., water vs. vegetation). Second, by early\nchecking, the class with the major misclassified area is flagged, and a\nlightweight binary expert segmentation model is trained to distinguish the\nflagged class from the rest. Third, a Bayesian smoothing step refines\nboundaries and removes spurious noise by leveraging nearby pixel information.\nWe validate the framework on the April 2024 Dubai storm event, using pre- and\npost-rainfall PlanetScope composites.

Using datasets from domains such as SMS spam, COVID-19\nfake news, and hate speech, we evaluate model generalization on unseen tasks\nwith minimal labeled anomalies. Our method combines episodic training with\nprototypical networks and domain resampling to adapt quickly to new anomaly\ndetection tasks.

We propose in this work a novel multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning named Hierarchical Adaptive Grouping-based Parameter Sharing (HAG-PS)\nfor dynamic mobility resource allocation. HAG-PS aims to address two important\nresearch challenges regarding multi-agent reinforcement learning for mobility\nresource allocation: (1) how to dynamically and adaptively share the mobility\nresource allocation policy (i.e., how to distribute mobility resources) across\nagents (i.e., representing the regional coordinators of mobility resources);\nand (2) how to achieve memory-efficient parameter sharing in an urban-scale\nsetting.

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this\ndecoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and\nthe glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the\ntextual dependencies in the glosses. Our approach incorporates a temporal\ncompression module using 1D CNNs to efficiently process pose sequences,\nfollowed by AraGPT2, a pre-trained Arabic decoder, to generate text (glosses).\nThrough comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that hand and body\ngestures provide the most discriminative features for signer-independent CSLR.\nBy eliminating the multi-stage pipeline, AutoSign achieves substantial\nimprovements on the Isharah-1000 dataset, achieving an improvement of up to\n6.1\\% in WER score compared to the best existing method.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoSign\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7ffb\u8bd1\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u548c\u8bcd\u6c47\u6269\u5c55\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281D CNN\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684AraGPT2\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\uff08glosses\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728Isharah-1000\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWER\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoSign\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u624b\u8bed\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u624b\u52bf\u548c\u8eab\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

Despite advances\nin language understanding, current research lacks evaluation of how LLMs\nperform spatial navigation without visual cues, a fundamental requirement for\nagents operating with limited sensory information. This paper addresses this\ngap by introducing MazeEval, a benchmark designed to isolate and evaluate pure\nspatial reasoning in LLMs through coordinate-based maze navigation tasks. Our\nmethodology employs a function-calling interface where models navigate mazes of\nvarying complexity ($5\\times 5$ to $15\\times 15$ grids) using only coordinate\nfeedback and distance-to-wall information, excluding visual input to test\nfundamental spatial cognition. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs across\nidentical mazes in both English and Icelandic to assess cross-linguistic\ntransfer of spatial abilities. Our findings reveal striking disparities: while\nOpenAI's O3 achieves perfect navigation for mazes up to size $30\\times 30$,\nother models exhibit catastrophic failure beyond $9\\times 9$ mazes, with 100%\nof failures attributed to excessive looping behavior where models revisit a\ncell at least 10 times. We document a significant performance degradation in\nIcelandic, with models solving mazes 3-4 sizes smaller than in English,\nsuggesting spatial reasoning in LLMs emerges from linguistic patterns rather\nthan language-agnostic mechanisms.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

However, the current landscape supports\nonly a limited set of certifiers, and developing new ones or modifying existing\nones for different applications remains difficult. This is because the\nmathematical design of certifiers is expressed at the neuron level, while their\nimplementations are optimized and executed at the tensor level. This mismatch\ncreates a semantic gap between design and implementation, making manual\nbridging both complex and expertise-intensive -- requiring deep knowledge in\nformal methods, high-performance computing, etc.\n  We propose a compiler framework that automatically translates neuron-level\nspecifications of DNN certifiers into tensor-based, layer-level\nimplementations. This is enabled by two key innovations: a novel stack-based\nintermediate representation (IR) and a shape analysis that infers the implicit\ntensor operations needed to simulate the neuron-level semantics. During\nlifting, the shape analysis creates tensors in the minimal shape required to\nperform the corresponding operations. The IR also enables domain-specific\noptimizations as rewrites.

Most existing work\nfocuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have\nexplored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts\nare restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and\nlack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness.

One key desirable capability for speech language\nmodels is the ability to capture the intricate interdependency between content\nand prosody. The existing mainstream paradigm of training speech language\nmodels, which converts speech into discrete tokens before feeding them into\nLLMs, is sub-optimal in learning prosody information -- we find that the\nresulting LLMs do not exhibit obvious emerging prosody processing capabilities\nvia pre-training alone. To overcome this, we propose ProsodyLM, which\nintroduces a simple tokenization scheme amenable to learning prosody. Each\nspeech utterance is first transcribed into text, followed by a sequence of\nword-level prosody tokens.

To address these, we\npropose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as\nrepresentation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.\n3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of\nGaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing\na flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to\nconstruct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based\nLocalization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize\ncoarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians\ninto multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing\non sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while\noffering comprehensive scene perception.

Variations in LiDAR types and\ndynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene\nconsistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure\ndetection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging\nframework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,\ndynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A\nvoxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify\nand reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal\nmodule is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved\nstatic local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are\nconducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a\ncentralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during\nmap merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph\noptimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for\nglobally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse\nreal-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing\nsuperior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping\nin dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing\nmethods.

Existing unlearning methods can generally be categorized into exact\nunlearning and approximate unlearning. However, exact unlearning requires high\ntraining costs while approximate unlearning faces two issues when applied to\nKGs due to the inherent connectivity of triples: (1) It fails to fully remove\ntargeted information, as forgetting triples can still be inferred from\nremaining ones. (2) It focuses on local data for specific removal, which\nweakens the remaining knowledge in the forgetting boundary. To address these\nissues, we propose GraphDPO, a novel approximate unlearning framework based on\ndirect preference optimization (DPO). Firstly, to effectively remove forgetting\ntriples, we reframe unlearning as a preference optimization problem, where the\nmodel is trained by DPO to prefer reconstructed alternatives over the original\nforgetting triples.

Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions.

For example, if an user\nclicks a product webpage and then leaves, it might because there are certain\nfeatures that don't satisfy the user, which serve as an important indicator of\non-the-spot user preferences. However, all prior works fail to capture and\nmodel customer intention effectively because insufficient information\nexploitation and only apparent information like descriptions and titles are\nused.

In realistic reasoning\nscenarios, LLMs can often utilize external tools to assist in task-solving\nprocesses. However, current RL algorithms inadequately balance the models'\nintrinsic long-horizon reasoning capabilities and their proficiency in\nmulti-turn tool interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose Agentic Reinforced\nPolicy Optimization (ARPO), a novel agentic RL algorithm tailored for training\nmulti-turn LLM-based agents. Through preliminary experiments, we observe that\nLLMs tend to exhibit highly uncertain behavior, characterized by an increase in\nthe entropy distribution of generated tokens, immediately following\ninteractions with external tools. Motivated by this observation, ARPO\nincorporates an entropy-based adaptive rollout mechanism, dynamically balancing\nglobal trajectory sampling and step-level sampling, thereby promoting\nexploration at steps with high uncertainty after tool usage. By integrating an\nadvantage attribution estimation, ARPO enables LLMs to internalize advantage\ndifferences in stepwise tool-use interactions. Our experiments across 13\nchallenging benchmarks in computational reasoning, knowledge reasoning, and\ndeep search domains demonstrate ARPO's superiority over trajectory-level RL\nalgorithms.

Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are\nusually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have\nbeen widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their\nsuperior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the\nreal-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear\nself-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this\nissue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for\nits adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data,\nparticularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose\nMambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation.\nOur MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a\nbifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the\ntexture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging\nconvolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range\ndependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to\ncombine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate\ngeneration of segmentation masks.

We evaluate the framework using both (i)\npositive-unlabeled (PU) online learning with base classifiers, and (ii)\ninstruction-tuned language models to assess post-training alignment.

Existing methods typically demand substantial training\nsamples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused\nCLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local\ndefects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes\nanomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both\nclass-level features for image classification and patch-level features for\nprecise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve\ndetection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial\naggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.\nComplementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts\nthat generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on\nauxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates\nstrong zero-shot detection capability.

To evaluate hallucination behaviors, we\nadopt a fine-grained-level LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with tailored risk-aware\nprompts, enabling scalable, high-fidelity assessment of agent actions without\nenumerating full action spaces.

By providing a structured framework\nfor understanding and designing self-evolving agents, this survey establishes a\nroadmap for advancing adaptive agentic systems in both research and real-world\ndeployments, ultimately shedding lights to pave the way for the realization of\nArtificial Super Intelligence (ASI), where agents evolve autonomously,\nperforming at or beyond human-level intelligence across a wide array of tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5176\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u8fdb\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u65f6\u673a\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u7279\u6027\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u56f4\u7ed5\u2018\u8fdb\u5316\u4ec0\u4e48\u2019\u3001\u2018\u4f55\u65f6\u8fdb\u5316\u2019\u548c\u2018\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u5316\u2019\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u7f16\u7a0b\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u533b\u7597\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5de5\u8d85\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\uff08ASI\uff09\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this study, we provide empirical evidence on how output\nsequence length information is encoded within the internal representations in\nLLMs. In particular, our findings show that multi-head attention mechanisms are\ncritical in determining output sequence length, which can be adjusted in a\ndisentangled manner.

This paper proposes an HSI\ndenoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),\nbased on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving\nthree-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel\ndomains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)\nintroducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract\ncross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a\ndynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain\ntexture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating\nmechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers\ncapture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep\nlayers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.\nExperiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST\nsignificantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational\nefficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This framework efficiently\ngenerate high-affinity binders for various protein targets, validated with\npredicted binding affinities using free energy perturbation (FEP) methods.

Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data.

All 4,249 PFD\nreports published from July 2013 to November 2023 were processed via PFD\nToolkit's large language model pipelines. Automated screening identified cases\nwhere the coroner attributed death to suicide in individuals aged 18 or\nyounger, and eligible reports were coded for recipient category and 23 concern\nsub-themes, replicating the ONS coding frame. PFD Toolkit identified 72\nchild-suicide PFD reports - almost twice the ONS count. Three blinded\nclinicians adjudicated a stratified sample of 144 reports to validate the\nchild-suicide screening. Against the post-consensus clinical annotations, the\nLLM-based workflow showed substantial to almost-perfect agreement (Cohen's\n$\\kappa$ = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.66-0.98, raw agreement = 91%). The end-to-end script\nruntime was 8m 16s, transforming a process that previously took months into one\nthat can be completed in minutes. This demonstrates that automated LLM analysis\ncan reliably and efficiently replicate manual thematic reviews of coronial\ndata, enabling scalable, reproducible, and timely insights for public health\nand safety. The PFD Toolkit is openly available for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5de5\u5177PFD Toolkit\u6210\u529f\u590d\u73b0\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u7684\u513f\u7ae5\u81ea\u6740PFD\u62a5\u544a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u624b\u52a8\u5206\u6790PFD\u62a5\u544a\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u6790\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bPFD Toolkit\u81ea\u52a8\u5904\u74064,249\u4efdPFD\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u513f\u7ae5\u81ea\u6740\u6848\u4f8b\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3b\u9898\u3002", "result": "PFD Toolkit\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa72\u4efd\u513f\u7ae5\u81ea\u6740\u62a5\u544a\uff08\u6bd4\u624b\u52a8\u591a\u4e00\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\uff08Cohen\u2019s \u03ba=0.82\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316LLM\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u590d\u73b0\u624b\u52a8\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Accurate property prediction\nfor polymers is essential for their design, development, and application.\nHowever, existing modeling approaches, which typically represent polymers by\nthe constituent monomers, struggle to capture the whole properties of polymer,\nsince the properties change during the polymerization process. In this study,\nwe propose a Multimodal Infinite Polymer Sequence (MIPS) pre-training\nframework, which represents polymers as infinite sequences of monomers and\nintegrates both topological and spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\nFrom the topological perspective, we generalize message passing mechanism (MPM)\nand graph attention mechanism (GAM) to infinite polymer sequences. For MPM, we\ndemonstrate that applying MPM to infinite polymer sequences is equivalent to\napplying MPM on the induced star-linking graph of monomers. For GAM, we propose\nto further replace global graph attention with localized graph attention (LGA).\nMoreover, we show the robustness of the \"star linking\" strategy through Repeat\nand Shift Invariance Test (RSIT). Despite its robustness, \"star linking\"\nstrategy exhibits limitations when monomer side chains contain ring structures,\na common characteristic of polymers, as it fails the Weisfeiler-Lehman~(WL)\ntest. To overcome this issue, we propose backbone embedding to enhance the\ncapability of MPM and LGA on infinite polymer sequences. From the spatial\nperspective, we extract 3D descriptors of repeating monomers to capture spatial\ninformation.

Traditional methods often struggle\nwith scalability and capturing global structural information. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN)-based\nprobabilistic framework that learns a probability distribution over the entire\nspace of causal graphs, unlike methods that output a single deterministic\ngraph. Our framework leverages a GNN that encodes both node and edge attributes\ninto a unified graph representation, enabling the model to learn complex causal\nstructures directly from data.

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image\nsegmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.\nHowever, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when\napplied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods\ntypically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks\nand leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.\nHowever, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due\nto constraints in their feature extraction techniques.

Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters\ncapable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex\nwavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,\nSAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense\nprediction.

In this paper, we describe our\nsolutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism\nIdentification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask\n1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address\neach subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck\nModel (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a\nfine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as\nhuman-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models\n(LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of\nadjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks.\nSCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual\nembeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification\nperformance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained\nexplanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also\ninvestigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles,\ncan be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data\naugmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for\nEnglish in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and\nSpanish and 6th for Spanish.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCBM\u3001SCBMT\u548cXLM-RoBERTa\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u6b67\u89c6\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u6027\u522b\u6b67\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SCBM\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5bb9\u8bcd\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u6982\u5ff5\uff09\u3001SCBMT\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u5bb9\u8bcd\u548cTransformer\uff09\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684XLM-RoBERTa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "XLM-RoBERTa\u5728\u5b50\u4efb\u52a11.1\u4e2d\u6392\u540d\u9760\u524d\uff0cSCBMT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u522b\u6b67\u89c6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

To evaluate these capabilities, we develop a\nbenchmark of real-world Web accessibility violations. Our benchmark quantifies\nsyntactic and layout compliance and judges semantic accuracy through\ncomparative analysis with human expert corrections.

Our\ndataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of\nindirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968\nspecies, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with\nspecies-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained\ntrait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike\nexisting datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal\nappearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,\ndetection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more\ndetailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively\nevaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal\nidentification from their traces.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform\npreviously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating\nparameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research\nhas actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus\non relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.\nTo advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more\ncomplex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire\nin-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise\ndynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token\nand its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually\nconverge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and\nexhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques\nthat explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate\nL-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify\nthat the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor\ngoverning the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these\ninsights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a\nthreshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction\nerror.

To address\nthese issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the\n8$\\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\\times$ one while adapting to the\npre-trained UNet.

A,\n185 (1894), pp. 71-110] first applied the method of moments (MM) for modeling\ndata as a mixture of one-dimensional Gaussians, moment-based estimation methods\nhave proliferated. Among these methods, the generalized method of moments (GMM)\nimproves the statistical efficiency of MM by weighting the moments\nappropriately. However, the computational complexity and storage complexity of\nMM and GMM grow exponentially with the dimension, making these methods\nimpractical for high-dimensional data or when higher-order moments are\nrequired. Such computational bottlenecks are more severe in GMM since it\nadditionally requires estimating a large weighting matrix. To overcome these\nbottlenecks, we propose the diagonally-weighted GMM (DGMM), which achieves a\nbalance among statistical efficiency, computational complexity, and numerical\nstability. We apply DGMM to study the parameter estimation problem for weakly\nseparated heteroscedastic low-rank Gaussian mixtures and design a\ncomputationally efficient and numerically stable algorithm that obtains the\nDGMM estimator without explicitly computing or storing the moment tensors. We\nimplement the proposed algorithm and empirically validate the advantages of\nDGMM: in numerical studies, DGMM attains smaller estimation errors while\nrequiring substantially shorter runtime than MM and GMM.

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring\ndomain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or\nmutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods\noften require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world\nscenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited\ntarget data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance,\nwhich is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to\noverfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in\nuninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset\nof the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these\nissues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with\nlimited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor\n($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network\ntraining, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain\nproximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate\nadditional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus\nenhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through\ntheoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments,\nwe demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain\noffline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDmC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7k-NN\u4f30\u8ba1\u57df\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u57df\u91cd\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528k-NN\u4f30\u8ba1\u57df\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\u3002", "result": "DmC\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "DmC\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Similarly, conventional graph coarsening methods,\nthough reducing graph scale, frequently lose fine-grained structural details.\nMPCCL addresses these challenges through an innovative multi-scale coarsening\nstrategy, which progressively condenses the graph while prioritizing the\nmerging of key edges based on global node similarity to preserve essential\nstructural information. It further introduces a one-to-many contrastive\nlearning paradigm, integrating node embeddings with augmented graph views and\ncluster centroids to enhance feature diversity, while mitigating feature\nmasking issues caused by the accumulation of high-frequency node weights during\nmulti-scale coarsening. By incorporating a graph reconstruction loss and KL\ndivergence into its self-supervised learning framework, MPCCL ensures\ncross-scale consistency of node representations.

Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN).

While approximate unlearning algorithms offer\nefficient alternatives to full retraining, this work reveals that they fail to\nadequately protect the privacy of unlearned data. In particular, these\nalgorithms introduce implicit residuals which facilitate privacy attacks\ntargeting at unlearned data. We observe that these residuals persist regardless\nof model architectures, parameters, and unlearning algorithms, exposing a new\nattack surface beyond conventional output-based leakage. Based on this insight,\nwe propose the Reminiscence Attack (ReA), which amplifies the correlation\nbetween residuals and membership privacy through targeted fine-tuning\nprocesses. ReA achieves up to 1.90x and 1.12x higher accuracy than prior\nattacks when inferring class-wise and sample-wise membership, respectively.

However,\ntheir reliance on labeled target logs makes them susceptible to the cold-start\nproblem when labeled logs are insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we\nexplore a novel yet underexplored setting: zero-label cross-system log anomaly\ndetection, where the target system logs are entirely unlabeled. To this end, we\npropose FreeLog, a system-agnostic representation meta-learning method that\neliminates the need for labeled target system logs, enabling cross-system log\nanomaly detection under zero-label conditions. Experimental results on three\npublic log datasets demonstrate that FreeLog achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art methods that rely on a small amount of labeled data from the\ntarget system.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeLog\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u663e\u8457\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5FreeLog\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFreeLog\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeLog\u4e3a\u96f6\u6807\u7b7e\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u5fd7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While\nnumerous embedding models have been proposed, their performance varies across\ndomains, and no single model consistently excels across all tasks.

However, most existing ensemble methods operate on deterministic\nembeddings and fail to account for model-specific uncertainty, limiting their\nrobustness and reliability in downstream applications.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control.

Despite\nthese advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and\naction spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous\nstate and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally\nattained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a\nsemi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show\nthat the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low\ndimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional\nnominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that,\nunder certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order\nof the dimensionality of the action space.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception.

Experiments across 23\nreal-world datasets show iHOMER outperforms 5 state-of-the-art global\nbaselines, such as MLHAT, MLHT of Pruned Sets and iSOUPT, by 23\\%, and 12 local\nbaselines, such as binary relevance transformations of kNN, EFDT, ARF, and\nADWIN bagging/boosting ensembles, by 32\\%, establishing its robustness for\nonline multi-label classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "iHOMER\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6f14\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "iHOMER\u91c7\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eJaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6811\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5143Bernoulli\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u533a\u3002", "result": "\u572823\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0ciHOMER\u6bd45\u79cd\u5168\u5c40\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534723%\uff0c\u6bd412\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534732%\u3002", "conclusion": "iHOMER\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this\nissue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave\ninfrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion\ndetection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature\ninteraction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks,\nachieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive\nfused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images\nand improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the\nMulti-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive\nfused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple\nmodalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features.\nMoreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object\nEnhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object\nsemantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary\nfused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features,\nthereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a\nNearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective\nSWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this\nfield.

The rise of large language models provides\nsignificant potential for social network simulations to capture attitude\ndynamics and reproduce collective behaviors. However, existing studies mainly\nfocus on scaling up agent populations, neglecting the dynamic evolution of\nsocial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce DynamiX, a novel\nlarge-scale social network simulator dedicated to dynamic social network\nmodeling. DynamiX uses a dynamic hierarchy module for selecting core agents\nwith key characteristics at each timestep, enabling accurate alignment of\nreal-world adaptive switching of user roles. Furthermore, we design distinct\ndynamic social relationship modeling strategies for different user types. For\nopinion leaders, we propose an information-stream-based link prediction method\nrecommending potential users with similar stances, simulating homogeneous\nconnections, and autonomous behavior decisions.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention.

Consequently,\nthe presented technique lays the foundation for various downstream tasks that\nrely on future player positions such as the creation of player-predictive bot\nbehavior or player anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408U-Net\u548c\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4eba\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73a9\u5bb6\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u8350\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u548c\u73a9\u5bb6\u4e92\u52a8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528U-Net\u751f\u6210\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6982\u7387\u70ed\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u73a9\u5bb6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also\nuses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from\nforeground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention\nstrategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable\nstylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark\ndataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the\nlack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition. Our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations, significantly improving the LPIPS score by 30.5% and the CSD\nmetric by 18.1%. We believe our method will advance future research and\napplications.

We evaluated\nlogical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used\nSPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)\nCollaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.\n  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data\nproperties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To\nstandardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive\ndefinitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully\nvalidated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,\nfor instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours\ndue to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.\n  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,\nincluding ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,\nand outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the\nability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy\nrecommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,\nintegration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.\n  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and\ndemonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient\nscenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u547c\u5438\u652f\u6301\uff08NIRS\uff09\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6025\u6027\u62a4\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u652f\u6301\u6025\u6027\u62a4\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u547c\u5438\u652f\u6301\uff08NIRS\uff09\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OWL\u8bed\u4e49\u548cProtege\u6784\u5efa\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0SWRL\u89c4\u5219\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7SPARQL\u67e5\u8be2\u548ceICU\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u4f53\u5305\u542b132\u4e2a\u7c7b\u300112\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5c5e\u6027\u548c17\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "NIRS\u672c\u4f53\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u6863\u3001\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u548cNIRS\u7ed3\u679c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Despite its importance, there is currently no\npublicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration\nin UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To\nbridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ntailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This\ndataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely\nregistered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight\naltitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\\deg} to 75{\\deg}, and\nall-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination\nconditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated\nannotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each\ntriplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely\nvisual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable\nreasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

Deep learning integration into\nstructural proteomics workflows addresses longstanding challenges including low\nsignal-to-noise ratios, preferred orientation artifacts, and missing-wedge\nproblems that historically limited efficiency and scalability. This review\nexamines AI applications across the entire cryoEM pipeline, from automated\nparticle picking using convolutional neural networks (Topaz, crYOLO,\nCryoSegNet) to computational solutions for preferred orientation bias\n(spIsoNet, cryoPROS) and advanced denoising algorithms (Topaz-Denoise). In\ncryoET, tools like IsoNet employ U-Net architectures for simultaneous\nmissing-wedge correction and noise reduction, while TomoNet streamlines\nsubtomogram averaging through AI-driven particle detection.

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented.

As a\nresult, simulated behavior is oftentimes computationally expensive. In an\nincreasingly data-driven world, the usage of efficient data-driven design\nschemes is a popular choice. Among them, Bayesian optimization (BO) with\nGaussian process regression is one of the most important representatives. The\nauthors argue that computational savings can be obtained from exploiting\nthorough surrogate modeling and selecting a design candidate based on multiple\nacquisition functions. This is feasible due to the relatively low computational\ncost, compared to the expensive simulation objective. This paper addresses the\nshortcomings in the adjacent literature by providing and implementing a novel\nheuristic framework to perform BO with adaptive hyperparameters across the\nvarious optimization iterations. Adaptive BO is subsequently compared to\nregular BO when faced with synthetic objective minimization problems. The\nresults show the efficiency of adaptive BO when compared any worst-performing\nregular Bayesian schemes. As an engineering use case, the solder joint\nreliability problem is tackled by minimizing the accumulated non-linear creep\nstrain under a cyclic thermal load.

However, existing\napproaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective\nhybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetworks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for\nefficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built\non two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and\naverage neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions\nto extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate\nneighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression\nproblem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate\nground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic\nnetworks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world\nnetworks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve\nreal world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms\ntraditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking\naccuracy, while operating in very fast runtime.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes.

Recent state-of-the-art\nmethods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face\nis masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned\nwith the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from\nthe lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity\nreference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common\nmasking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,\nsignificantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and\nidentity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image\ndegrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively\nimpacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the\naudio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation\napproach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking\nthe lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a\ntwo-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner.

Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial\ndatasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.\nProject page is available at: https://humansensinglab.github.io/AGenDA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u57df\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AP50\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u4e3a4-23%\u30016-10%\u30017-40%\u548c50%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors.

While quantum machine learning offers a\npromising route to efficiently capture physical properties from\nhigh-dimensional data, its practical deployment is hindered by current hardware\nnoise and limited scalability. We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning\nframework for learning partial differential equations, with an application\nfocus on chaotic systems. A quantum circuit Born machine is employed to learn\nthe invariant properties of chaotic dynamical systems, achieving substantial\nmemory efficiency by representing these complex physical statistics with a\ncompact set of trainable circuit parameters. This approach reduces the data\nstorage requirement by over two orders of magnitude compared to the raw\nsimulation data. The resulting statistical quantum-informed prior is then\nincorporated into a Koopman-based auto-regressive model to address issues such\nas gradient vanishing or explosion, while maintaining long-term statistical\nfidelity.

However, little attention has been given to the\nimmersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which\nremains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we\ndraw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use\nunconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for\nunderstanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we\nextend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel\nframework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo\ncollections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the\nsame viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance\nfield, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language\nfeature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the\nmulti-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process.

Extensive experiments\nacross diverse datasets and recommendation algorithms demonstrate the\nsuperiority of NodeDiffRec, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance, with\nmaximum average performance improvement 98.6% in Recall@5 and 84.0% in NDCG@5\nover selected baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "NodeDiffRec\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u56fe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6216\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u589e\u5f3a\u539f\u8bed\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNodeDiffRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u7269\u54c1\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u504f\u597d\u5efa\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0cRecall@5\u548cNDCG@5\u6700\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u522b\u4e3a98.6%\u548c84.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "NodeDiffRec\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A crucial\nprocessing step to this aim is the extraction of suitable features.

Here, we compare nine feature subtypes\nextracted from resting-state functional MRI recordings for behavior prediction,\nranging from regional measures of functional activity to functional\nconnectivity (FC) and metrics derived with graph signal processing (GSP), a\nprincipled approach for the extraction of structure-informed functional\nfeatures.

The scaling properties of the\nfeatures are investigated for different combinations of sample size and scan\ntime. FC comes out as the best feature for predicting cognition, age, and sex.\nGraph power spectral density is the second best for predicting cognition and\nage, while for sex, variability-based features show potential as well.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose \\textit{FedABC}, an innovative client selection\nalgorithm designed to take a long-term view in managing data heterogeneity and\noptimizing client participation.

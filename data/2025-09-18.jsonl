We evaluate both accuracy and computational efficiency (FLOPs) on\nRewardBench tasks, and further examine augmentation strategies for non-thinking\nmodels, including in-context learning, rubric-guided judging, reference-based\nevaluation, and n-best aggregation. Our results show that despite these\nenhancements, non-thinking models generally fall short of their thinking\ncounterparts. Our results show that thinking models achieve approximately 10%\npoints higher accuracy with little overhead (under 2x), in contrast to\naugmentation strategies like few-shot learning, which deliver modest gains at a\nhigher cost (>8x). Bias and robustness analyses further demonstrate that\nthinking models maintain significantly greater consistency under a variety of\nbias conditions such as positional, bandwagon, identity, diversity, and random\nbiases (6% higher on average). We further extend our experiments to the\nmultilingual setting and our results confirm that explicit reasoning extends\nits benefits beyond English. Overall, our work results in several important\nfindings that provide systematic evidence that explicit reasoning offers clear\nadvantages in the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm not only in accuracy and efficiency\nbut also in robustness."}

We faced two major\ntechnical challenges in dataset creation: imbalanced classes -- we estimate\nfewer than 8% of sentences express a non-neutral stance towards monetary policy\n-- and inter-sentence dependence -- 65% of instances require context beyond the\nsentence-level. To address these challenges, we developed a five-stage\nhierarchical schema to isolate aspects of opinion, monetary policy, and stance\ntowards monetary policy as well as the level of context needed. Second, we\nselected instances to annotate using active learning, roughly doubling the\nnumber of positive instances across all schema aspects. Using Op-Fed, we found\na top-performing, closed-weight LLM achieves 0.80 zero-shot accuracy in opinion\nclassification but only 0.61 zero-shot accuracy classifying stance towards\nmonetary policy -- below our human baseline of 0.89.

We also propose a cross-corpus fine-tuning framework\nfor severity classification, adapted from detection-based transfer learning\napproaches. DSSCNet is evaluated on two benchmark dysarthric speech corpora:\nTORGO and UA-Speech under speaker-independent evaluation protocols:\nOne-Speaker-Per-Severity (OSPS) and Leave-One-Speaker-Out (LOSO) protocols.\nDSSCNet achieves accuracies of 56.84% and 62.62% under OSPS and 63.47% and\n64.18% under LOSO setting on TORGO and UA-Speech respectively outperforming\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. Upon fine-tuning, the performance improves\nsubstantially, with DSSCNet achieving up to 75.80% accuracy on TORGO and 68.25%\non UA-Speech in OSPS, and up to 77.76% and 79.44%, respectively, in LOSO. These\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of DSSCNet for\nfine-grained severity classification across diverse dysarthric speech datasets."}

Inspired by real-world crowdsourcing companies, we\nintroduce CrowdAgent, a multi-agent system that provides end-to-end process\ncontrol by integrating task assignment, data annotation, and quality/cost\nmanagement. It implements a novel methodology that rationally assigns tasks,\nenabling LLMs, SLMs, and human experts to advance synergistically in a\ncollaborative annotation workflow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nCrowdAgent through extensive experiments on six diverse multimodal\nclassification tasks.

The methodology first employs an ensemble of\nclassical machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)\nfor intelligent feature engineering and dimensionality reduction. Subsequently,\na Quantum Neural Network (QNN), trained via the parameter-shift rule, serves as\nthe core classifier. This framework was evaluated through numerical simulations\nand deployed on the Quafu Quantum Cloud Platform's ScQ-P21 superconducting\nprocessor. On a real-world credit dataset of 279 samples, our QNN achieved a\nrobust average AUC of 0.852 +/- 0.027 in simulations and yielded an impressive\nAUC of 0.88 in the hardware experiment. This performance surpasses a suite of\nclassical benchmarks, with a particularly strong result on the recall metric.\nThis study provides a pragmatic blueprint for applying quantum computing to\ndata-constrained financial scenarios in the NISQ era and offers valuable\nempirical evidence supporting its potential in high-stakes applications like\ninclusive finance."}

While pure data-driven models offer computational efficiency,\nthey often lack generalization across scales and do not incorporate explicit\nphysical constraints. Pore network models (PNMs), on the other hand, are\nphysics-based and efficient but rely on idealized geometric assumptions to\nestimate pore-scale hydraulic conductance, limiting their accuracy in complex\nstructures. To overcome these limitations, we present an end-to-end\ndifferentiable hybrid framework that embeds a graph neural network (GNN) into a\nPNM. In this framework, the analytical formulas used for conductance\ncalculations are replaced by GNN-based predictions derived from pore and throat\nfeatures. The predicted conductances are then passed to the PNM solver for\npermeability computation. In this way, the model avoids the idealized geometric\nassumptions of PNM while preserving the physics-based flow calculations. The\nGNN is trained without requiring labeled conductance data, which can number in\nthe thousands per pore network; instead, it learns conductance values by using\na single scalar permeability as the training target. This is made possible by\nbackpropagating gradients through both the GNN (via automatic differentiation)\nand the PNM solver (via a discrete adjoint method), enabling fully coupled,\nend-to-end training. The resulting model achieves high accuracy and generalizes\nwell across different scales, outperforming both pure data-driven and\ntraditional PNM approaches.

FedSSG maintains a per-client drift memory that accumulates\nlocal model differences as a lightweight sketch of historical gradients;\ncrucially, it gates both the memory update and the local alignment term by a\nsmooth function of the observed/expected participation ratio (a\nphase-by-expectation signal derived from the server sampler). This\nstatistically grounded gate stays weak and smooth when sampling noise dominates\nearly, then strengthens once participation statistics stabilize, contracting\nthe local-global gap without extra communication. Across CIFAR-10/100 with\n100/500 clients and 2-15 percent participation, FedSSG consistently outperforms\nstrong drift-aware baselines and accelerates convergence; on our benchmarks it\nimproves test accuracy by up to a few points (e.g., about +0.9 on CIFAR-10 and\nabout +2.7 on CIFAR-100 on average over the top-2 baseline) and yields about\n4.5x faster target-accuracy convergence on average. The method adds only O(d)\nclient memory and a constant-time gate, and degrades gracefully to a mild\nregularizer under near-IID or uniform sampling. FedSSG shows that sampling\nstatistics can be turned into a principled, history-aware phase control to\nstabilize and speed up federated training."}

Hallucinations, the\ngeneration of fabricated, misleading, oversimplified or untrustworthy outputs,\nhas emerged as imperative challenges. While regulatory, academic, and technical\ndiscourse position accuracy as the principal benchmark for mitigating such\nharms, this article contends that overreliance on accuracy misdiagnoses the\nproblem and has counterproductive effect: the accuracy paradox. Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness. This encourages\npassive user trust in outputs that appear accurate but epistemically untenable.\nSecond, accuracy as a singular metric fails to detect harms that are not\nfactually false but are nonetheless misleading, value-laden, or socially\ndistorting, including consensus illusions, sycophantic alignment, and subtle\nmanipulation. Third, regulatory overemphasis on accuracy obscures the wider\nsocietal consequences of hallucination, including social sorting, privacy\nviolations, equity harms, epistemic convergence that marginalises dissent,\nreduces pluralism, and causes social deskilling. By examining the EU AI Act,\nGDPR, and DSA, the article argues that current regulations are not yet\nstructurally equipped to address these epistemic, relational, and systemic\nharms and exacerbated by the overreliance on accuracy. By exposing such\nconceptual and practical challenges, this article calls for a fundamental shift\ntowards pluralistic, context-aware, and manipulation-resilient approaches to AI\ntrustworthy governance."}

We propose TFMAdapter, a\nlightweight, instance-level adapter that augments TSFMs with covariate\ninformation without fine-tuning. Instead of retraining, TFMAdapter operates on\nthe limited history provided during a single model call, learning a\nnon-parametric cascade that combines covariates with univariate TSFM forecasts.\nHowever, such learning would require univariate forecasts at all steps in the\nhistory, requiring too many calls to the TSFM.

(2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the\nsuperiority of these models over established single-modal approaches,\nattributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich\nsemantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously\nunder-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting\nresilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive\nto prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of\nthe strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection,\noffering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and\nreliable future designs."}

However, existing approaches typically\ntreat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training\nGREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline\nthe overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic\nsegmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities\nand the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level\nboxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a\nmulti-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware\ncapabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and\nconsistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our\nknowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC\nand GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized\nvisual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a\nprior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target\nmatching.

Drawing on\ninterdisciplinary literatures, this article develops a taxonomy of\nhallucination types and shows the paradox along three intertwining dimensions:\noutputs, individuals and society. First, accuracy functions as a superficial\nproxy for reliability, incentivising the optimisation of rhetorical fluency and\nsurface-level correctness over epistemic trustworthiness.

Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the\nreconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the\npixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task.\nExtensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a\nsimple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive\nsemantic segmentation."}

By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,\nour approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene\ncomplexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of\ninformation, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to\nstrengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a\nsemantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside\nsuperpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts\nvisual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM\ntraining and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual\nprojectors on RIS."}

Here we present a natural language processing (NLP)\nscreening tool to detect high-severity incident reports in radiation oncology\nacross two institutions.\n  METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used two text datasets to train and evaluate our\nNLP models: 7,094 reports from our institution (Inst.), and 571 from IAEA\nSAFRON (SF), all of which had severity scores labeled by clinical content\nexperts. We trained and evaluated two types of models: baseline support vector\nmachines (SVM) and BlueBERT which is a large language model pretrained on\nPubMed abstracts and hospitalized patient data. We assessed for\ngeneralizability of our model in two ways. First, we evaluated models trained\nusing Inst.-train on SF-test. Second, we trained a BlueBERT_TRANSFER model that\nwas first fine-tuned on Inst.-train then on SF-train before testing on SF-test\nset. To further analyze model performance, we also examined a subset of 59\nreports from our Inst. dataset, which were manually edited for clarity.\n  RESULTS Classification performance on the Inst. test achieved AUROC 0.82\nusing SVM and 0.81 using BlueBERT. Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,\nimproved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and\nBlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and\n0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).\n  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP\nmodels on incident report text from radiation oncology centers.

Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have\ndemonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we\nare the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two\nkey challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and\nanomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent\nbias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to\nsubtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,\nrather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal\nframework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a\nmultimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual\nbackbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder\nprovides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain\ngap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their\nrepresentations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task.

Results: Our analysis leads to six themes: value alignment drivers &\napproaches; challenges in value alignment; values in value alignment; cognitive\nprocesses in humans and AI; human-agent teaming; and designing and developing\nvalue-aligned systems. Conclusions: By analysing these themes in the context of\nthe literature we define value alignment as an ongoing process between humans\nand autonomous agents that aims to express and implement abstract values in\ndiverse contexts, while managing the cognitive limits of both humans and AI\nagents and also balancing the conflicting ethical and political demands\ngenerated by the values in different groups. Our analysis gives rise to a set\nof research challenges and opportunities in the field of value alignment for\nfuture work."}

An automatic video\nsegmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for\nimage segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase\nmatching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar\nrespiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction.\nThis is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead\nwithin the X-ray video.

The server then combines the received models using federated\naggregation algorithms to obtain a global model. This global model is\ndistributed back to the clients, and the process continues in a cyclical\nmanner. Although preventing data from leaving the clients enhances security,\ncertain concerns still remain. Attackers can perform inference attacks on the\nobtained models to approximate the training dataset, potentially causing data\nleakage. In this study, differential privacy was applied to address the\naforementioned security vulnerability, and a performance analysis was\nconducted. The Data-Unaware Classification Based on Association (duCBA)\nalgorithm was used as the federated aggregation method. Differential privacy\nwas implemented on the data using the Randomized Response technique, and the\ntrade-off between security and performance was examined under different epsilon\nvalues. As the epsilon value decreased, the model accuracy declined, and class\nprediction imbalances were observed. This indicates that higher levels of\nprivacy do not always lead to practical outcomes and that the balance between\nsecurity and performance must be carefully considered."}

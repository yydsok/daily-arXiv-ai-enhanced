### [1] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理(GSP)作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上表现出更好的逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型仅将频谱图方法作为外围组件，需要更数学基础扎实且计算高效的神经符号推理框架

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理，包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则接地

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准数据集上优于最先进的神经符号模型

Conclusion: GSP为稳健且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算高效的底层框架

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [2] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于佛教认识论的目标导向状态表示计算框架，描述性和规范性世界模型方面从智能体-环境交互中共同涌现，而非传统强化学习中的分离状态表示和奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面应该从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现。

Method: 引入目标导向（telic）状态概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。通过行为策略与期望经验特征之间的统计散度来提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经等多个维度的目的性行为，适用于不同基质。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解目的性行为提供了一个新颖的视角，挑战了传统世界模型的二分法，强调描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现特性。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

### [3] [Collab-REC: An LLM-based Agentic Framework for Balancing Recommendations in Tourism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15030)
*Ashmi Banerjee,Fitri Nur Aisyah,Adithi Satish,Wolfgang Wörndl,Yashar Deldjoo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，通过三个LLM智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成旅游推荐，再通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商，有效提升推荐多样性和平衡性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众景点得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）分别生成推荐，然后通过非LLM协调器进行多轮协商和整合，惩罚重复或无关响应。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC显著提升了推荐多样性和整体相关性，成功推荐了常被忽视的小众景点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够更好地平衡用户约束和旅游可持续性需求。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

### [4] [See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15222)
*Hantao Zhang,Jingyang Liu,Ed Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，通过VLM和LLM协同将手绘草图转换为精确可编辑的SVG图表，在流程图重建方面优于GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在照片真实感方面表现出色，但在空间精度、对齐和符号结构方面难以满足流程图等精确图表生成的需求

Method: 训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批评VLM提出编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成SVG更新，法官VLM选择最佳候选

Result: 在10个已发表论文流程图草图测试中，比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro更准确地重建布局和结构，能精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本

Conclusion: 该方法产生可编程SVG输出，易于通过API扩展到演示工具，可通过改进提示和任务特定工具进行专门化，代码已开源

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at
https://github.com/hantaoZhangrichard/see_it_say_it_sorted.git.

### [5] [Emergent Crowds Dynamics from Language-Driven Multi-Agent Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15047)
*Yibo Liu,Liam Shatzel,Brandon Haworth,Teseo Schneider*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型控制人群代理运动的新方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航实现更真实的人群模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人群模拟方法主要关注转向和高层目标推断，忽略了语言对话对社交和环境互动的重要影响，导致代理间互动有限

Method: 使用基于代理的LLM系统，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成代理间对话，并利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制导航和转向

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到自动的群体分组和解散行为，实现了人群内的信息传递机制，产生了更真实的群体行为

Conclusion: 该方法能够产生更真实的人群模拟效果，群体行为能够从环境设置中自然涌现，解决了现有方法在社交互动方面的局限性

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

### [6] [Multiple Memory Systems for Enhancing the Long-term Memory of Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15294)
*Gaoke Zhang,Bo Wang,Yunlong Ma,Dongming Zhao,Zifei Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过处理短期记忆生成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提升了记忆质量和回应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆模块如MemoryBank和A-MEM存储的记忆内容质量较差，影响回忆性能和回应质量，需要更好地处理交互过程中产生的大量历史数据。

Method: 设计了受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理为多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段匹配相关检索记忆单元，获取对应的上下文记忆作为响应上下文。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性，消融实验确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量的稳健性和存储开销，显示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据提升知识和回应质量，为大语言模型驱动的代理体提供了更好的记忆管理方案。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

### [7] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型的自信度检验能力，发现增加推理资源反而会导致过度自信，而信息检索才是改善自信度准确性的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大语言模型在问题回答中存在的过度自信问题，系统性地评估推理能力和计算资源对自信度评估准确性的影响。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康领域，对比分析纯粹推理和搜索增强生成的自信度检验结果。

Result: 推理LLM在专家自信度评估中仅达到48.7%准确率，增加推理资源会系统性导致过度自信。搜索增强生成准确率达到89.3%，显著优于纯粹推理。

Conclusion: 信息获取能力而非推理深度或计算资源是改善知识密集任务自信度准确性的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

numerous applications using deep learning and spectral analysis algorithms.

### [9] [Understanding Action Effects through Instrumental Empowerment in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15652)
*Ardian Selmonaj,Miroslav Strupl,Oleg Szehr,Alessandro Antonucci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论Shapley值的ICV方法，通过分析策略分布来量化智能体对队友因果影响，无需价值函数反馈即可评估个体贡献


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL系统主要基于显式奖励信号评估团队整体性能，但缺乏在无价值反馈情况下推断个体智能体贡献的方法

Method: 引入Intended Cooperation Values (ICV)方法，基于信息论Shapley值量化智能体对队友工具性赋能的因果影响，通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来衡量行动效果

Result: 在合作和竞争MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度，通过比较策略和价值函数间的行动效果，识别出有益于团队成功的行为

Conclusion: 该方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够识别通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益团队成功的行为

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

### [10] [S3LoRA: Safe Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning in Adaptation of Agent Planner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15068)
*Shuang Ao,Gopal Rumchurn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升安全性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调技术（如LoRA）在增强大语言模型能力的同时，可能会无意中损害安全对齐性，导致不安全或不稳定的行为。现有安全感知适应方法通常需要访问基础模型和指令微调模型检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1）引入MAS-SVD方法，在保留全局幅度信息的同时鲁棒分析LoRA更新的结构特性；2）设计SSI指标，检测具有高度集中和潜在不安全更新的层；3）对这些层进行后剪枝以降低风险。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA能够持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Language-Guided Tuning (LGT)框架，使用多智能体大语言模型通过自然语言推理智能优化机器学习配置，解决了传统方法缺乏可解释性和动态适应性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习配置优化存在关键瓶颈，传统方法将不同维度独立处理且缺乏可解释性，自动化方法难以实现动态适应性和语义推理。

Method: 引入文本梯度（定性反馈信号），协调三个专业智能体：提出配置变更的顾问、评估进展的评估器和优化决策过程的优化器，形成自我改进的反馈循环。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的推理有效解决了机器学习配置优化的关键挑战，为智能配置优化提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Method: 将劳动力管理问题建模为抽象论证框架，通过形式化论证来处理执行时的变更并生成解释

Result: 用户研究表明，该工具和解释方法比传统手工解决方案能带来更快、更准确的问题解决效果

Conclusion: 抽象论证框架为工业劳动力管理提供了有效的变更适应机制和可信解释能力，显著提升问题解决效率

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a
set of instruments. A crucial challenge in workforce management is
accommodating changes at execution time so that explanations are provided to
all stakeholders involved. Here, we show that, by understanding workforce
management as abstract argumentation in an industrial application, we can
accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI代理需要推断和响应未预定义的人类多样化目标和偏好的挑战，特别是在目标空间无界且动态演化的环境中

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，且不需要大型离线数据集，为开放宇宙辅助游戏提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

Conclusion: GUI-Owl和Mobile-Agent-v3为开源GUI代理框架设立了新的性能标杆，通过创新的基础设施和数据生成方法实现了显著的性能提升

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves
state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI
benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question
answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B
achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose
Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves
performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模合成可验证的数学逻辑数据，通过编码种子谜题、系统化变量约束随机化和有效性验证机制，构建了83K+多样化验证谜题数据集，显著提升LLM的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数学逻辑数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量可验证答案的数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 提出PuzzleClone框架：1) 将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范；2) 通过系统化变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体；3) 通过重现机制确保有效性。构建了83K+程序化验证的多样化谜题数据集。

Result: 在PuzzleClone数据集上进行后训练(SFT和RL)后，PuzzleClone测试集平均分从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑和数学基准上获得一致改进，最高提升12.5个百分点(AMC2023从52.5到65.0)。

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够大规模合成高质量可验证的数学逻辑数据，显著提升LLM的推理性能，不仅在自身测试集上表现优异，还能泛化到其他逻辑数学基准任务。

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

*Wenjie Lin,Jin Wei-Kocsis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了LLM4Sweat框架，通过数据增序、精细调整和专家评估三步骤，为稀有疾病多汗痆提供了可靠的诊断、个性化治疗和共情支持的开源LLM解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在医疗健康领域有应用潜力，但对于稀有疾病如多汗痆（影响2-3%人口），缺乏可靠的精细调整数据集，影响了LLM在诊断和照护方面的应用。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1）数据增序阶段：使用前沿LLM从经过精选的开源数据生成医学可行的合成案例；2）精细调整阶段：在开源基础模型上进行精细调整，提供诊断、个性化治疗建议和共情心理支持；3）推理和专家评估阶段：临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和共情能力，并逐次丰富数据集。

Result: 实验结果显示LLM4Sweat在性能上超过基线模型，成为首个为多汗痆提供开源LLM框架的解决方案，为其他稀有疾病提供了可推广的方法。

Conclusion: LLM4Sweat框架成功解决了稀有疾病数据稀缺和可靠性挑战，为多汗痆患者提供了可靠、共情的诊疗支持，具有广泛的医疗应用前景。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了R-ConstraintBench框架，用于评估大语言模型在高约束条件下的排程能力，发现约束相互作用是主要急冲而非图深度，并呈现出有限的过渡性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在高约束制条件下的排程可靠性未充分定性，需要一个可扩展框架来评估其在资源约束项目排程问题中的表现。

Method: 开发R-ConstraintBench框架，逐步增加无冗余的优先约束、停机时间、时间窗口和排他约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中实例化评测多个LLM模型。

Result: 强大模型在仅含优先约束的DAG上表现接近天花板，但当多种约束相互作用时性能崩溃，约束相互作用是主要问题。清洁合成数据的好表现不能保证在领域场景中的过渡性能。

Conclusion: 约束相互作用是LLM在高约束排程中的主要问题，需要更好地理解和处理约束之间的复杂作用。

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Conclusion: 约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时实现更广泛的解空间探索，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供了基于证据的计算工具，支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架，通过粗粒度到细粒度的记忆机制增强LLM在复杂规划任务中的适应能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆机制的LLM智能体主要依赖单一粒度的动态环境交互记忆，受限于经验收集质量，限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性

Method: 使用粗粒度关注点引导训练任务中的经验收集，然后从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示。在推理时检索任务相关经验和提示来支持规划，遇到环境异常时进行细粒度关键信息提取和自我问答反思

Result: 该方法能够充分利用记忆进行灵活的场景适应，通过粗到细的粒度转换提升规划质量

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效解决了单一粒度记忆的局限性，显著提升了LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的性能和适应性

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出SPW方法统一专家演示和偏好两种人类反馈，通过相似性搜索实现更精确的信用分配，在机器人操作任务中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但设计成本高。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配不明确

Method: 提出搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案，为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，从专家演示中搜索最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似性得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，指导标准偏好学习

Result: SPW能够有效联合学习偏好和演示，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于利用两种反馈类型的先前方法

Conclusion: SPW成功统一了两种人类反馈源，解决了传统方法难以实现的精确信用分配问题，为离线强化学习提供了更有效的人类反馈利用方案

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

*Bin Deng,Yizhe Feng,Zeming Liu,Qing Wei,Xiangrong Zhu,Shuai Chen,Yuanfang Guo,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决了现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的旅行规划系统存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，导致计划不可行；3）只能生成基本的POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含修订需求和环境感知能力。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA来处理旅行规划任务。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，而TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能，表明在真实世界旅行规划方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 真实世界的旅行规划仍然极具挑战性，但TGMA框架为这一领域提供了有希望的发展方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的框架。

Method: 使用导联独立编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLMs中的潜力，为医学推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了Think in Blocks框架，通过将推理过程划分为可调节的块数，使LLM能够根据任务复杂度动态调整推理长度，避免过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的思维链推理在处理复杂逻辑任务时表现良好，但过长的推理链会导致计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 建立块结构范式，模型先预测推理预算（块数），然后相应划分推理过程；通过三阶段训练流程（监督微调、奖励引导的DPO、强化学习）训练自适应模型；利用显式块数在推理时动态控制推理深度。

Result: 实现了根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度的能力，能够在部署时灵活调节思维链长度。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架有效解决了LLM过度思考问题，通过块结构化和自适应训练实现了推理长度的动态调节，提高了计算效率和响应速度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

*Filippo Tonini,Lukas Galke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究通过模拟囚徒困境锦标赛发现，语言模型代理在团队内部互动和团队间竞争的双重作用下，合作水平显著提升，包括一次性互动的初始合作倾向


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得越来越重要。研究受到超加性合作理论的启发，该理论认为重复互动和群体间竞争的结合是人类合作倾向的原因

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境游戏，模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争

Result: 发现这种内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和初始一次性合作水平

Conclusion: 为大型语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略和行动提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，对设计未来多代理AI系统至关重要

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景推理中生成的程序推理链过于简短，无法处理复杂问题，需要提升LLM在复杂3D任务中的工具使用能力

Method: 在SQA3D基准上采用组合迭代进化方法生成复杂问题，通过Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)直接优化模型生成的工具链策略，并对大语言模型进行精调

Result: 提出了DeepThink3D方法，能够生成更复杂的3D推理问题，并通过DPO技术提升模型在复杂任务中的准确性

Conclusion: 该研究有效提升了大语言模型在复杂3D场景推理任务中的工具使用能力，为复杂空间问题的解决提供了新的方法

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

*Ahmed Nasir,Abdelhafid Zenati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于动力系统理论的强化学习策略验证框架，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，提供定量安全指标和稳定性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要新的框架来验证学习策略的鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并开发了MBR、ASAS、TASAS等定量度量指标。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中验证了框架有效性，成功识别了仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了全面且可解释的策略行为评估，能够识别隐藏的安全问题和收敛特性，为安全关键应用中的RL部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

TL;DR: Agentics是一个模块化框架，用于构建基于代理的系统，支持结构化推理和组合泛化，通过数据建模而非提示工程实现声明式编程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统AI工作流中需要手工设计提示的问题，让开发者专注于数据建模而非提示工程，提供更高效的AI开发方式

Method: 采用模块化框架设计，将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，通过数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换，LLM在类型连接时执行逻辑转换

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进准确率或改进可扩展性而不牺牲性能

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了新的数据建模视角，通过声明式语言和逻辑转换机制，在多个任务中表现出色，具有研究和应用价值

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

*Meera Ray,Christopher L. Dancy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供向量符号替代方案，以获得更好的可扩展性、架构定义的块相似性，并保持与现有ACT-R模型的兼容性。

Method: 开发了基于向量的常见ACT-R函数版本，建立文本处理管道将大型文档内容添加到内存中，创建了仅使用令牌向量表示来检索整个内存块的新机制。

Result: 初步结果表明，HDM在保持向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块的块召回）的同时，能够与现有ACT-R模型兼容，只需很少或无需修改。

Conclusion: HDM成功实现了向量符号记忆系统的优势，同时保持了与ACT-R的兼容性，未来将改进时间上下文表示并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来进一步测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

*Mark Cote,Susana Aires*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，提出AI系统数据生命周期产生递归价值链，挑战现有负责任AI框架，主张监管需关注基础设施和时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分理解AI系统中数据的动态生成过程和递归价值链条，特别是从数据摄入到部署的生命周期如何产生权力不对称和技术寡头垄断。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合Simondon技术哲学中的个体化概念，构建AI生命周期模型（前个体环境、个体化、个体化AI），引入"未来性"概念分析AI的自我强化循环。

Result: 揭示了AI数据递归生成、非竞争性的本质，以及特征存储等基础设施如何支撑反馈、适应和时间递归，凸显了技术寡头在捕获、训练和部署基础设施中的权力集中。

Conclusion: 有效监管需要解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度和反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Conclusion: GRAFT为多模态模型在视觉基础结构化推理任务上的评估提供了统一、可扩展的框架，为该领域设立了新的评估标准。

Abstract: GRAFT is a structured multimodal benchmark for evaluating models on
instruction-following, visual reasoning, and visual-textual alignment tasks. It
features programmatically generated charts and synthetically rendered tables,
created with Python visualization libraries to ensure control over data
semantics, structure, and clarity. Each GRAFT instance pairs a chart or table
image with a systematically generated, multi-step analytical question based
solely on visual content. Answers are provided in structured formats such as
JSON or YAML, supporting consistent evaluation of both reasoning and output
format. The benchmark introduces a taxonomy of reasoning types including
comparison, trend identification, ranking, aggregation, proportion estimation,
and anomaly detection to enable comprehensive assessment. Reference answers
follow strict factual and formatting guidelines for precise, aspect-based
evaluation. GRAFT offers a unified, scalable framework for fine-grained
benchmarking of multimodal models on visually grounded, structured reasoning
tasks, setting a new evaluation standard in this field.

Abstract: We present NiceWebRL, a research tool that enables researchers to use machine
reinforcement learning (RL) environments for online human subject experiments.
NiceWebRL is a Python library that allows any Jax-based environment to be
transformed into an online interface, supporting both single-agent and
multi-agent environments. As such, NiceWebRL enables AI researchers to compare
their algorithms to human performance, cognitive scientists to test ML
algorithms as theories for human cognition, and multi-agent researchers to
develop algorithms for human-AI collaboration. We showcase NiceWebRL with 3
case studies that demonstrate its potential to help develop Human-like AI,
Human-compatible AI, and Human-assistive AI. In the first case study
(Human-like AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a novel RL model of
cognition. Here, NiceWebRL facilitates testing this model against human
participants in both a grid world and Craftax, a 2D Minecraft domain. In our
second case study (Human-compatible AI), NiceWebRL enables the development of a
novel multi-agent RL algorithm that can generalize to human partners in the
Overcooked domain. Finally, in our third case study (Human-assistive AI), we
show how NiceWebRL can allow researchers to study how an LLM can assist humans
on complex tasks in XLand-Minigrid, an environment with millions of
hierarchical tasks. The library is available at

TL;DR: 本文首次在真实生产环境中测量AI推理的环境影响，发现Gemini AI助手的文本提示中位能耗为0.24Wh，远低于公开估计，并展示了谷歌通过软件效率和清洁能源实现的显著环境效益改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI应用加速普及，需要理解和减轻AI服务对环境的影响，但目前缺乏在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标的研究。

Method: 提出并执行了全面的测量方法，在谷歌大规模AI生产环境中测量AI推理工作负载的能源使用、碳排放和水消耗，涵盖完整的AI服务基础设施栈。

Result: Gemini Apps文本提示中位能耗0.24Wh，比看电视9秒能耗更低；水消耗相当于5滴水(0.26mL)。谷歌的软件效率改进和清洁能源采购使能耗降低33倍，碳足迹减少44倍。

Conclusion: 虽然AI服务环境影响相对较低，但仍需持续关注。全面测量AI服务环境指标对于准确比较模型和在完整AI服务栈中激励效率提升至关重要。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

Motivation: 人工智能代理引发的假社交关系对人类健康造成严重危害，但防止此类问题面临困难

Method: 重新调整最先进语言模型，构建实时对话评估框架，使用30个合成对话数据集进行迭代测试

Result: 在宽松一致规则下，成功识别所有假社交对话且避免误拟，检测多在前几轮对话中完成

Conclusion: 评估代理为防止假社交关系提供了可行解决方案的初步证据

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

Motivation: 解决当前LLM内容安全方法依赖多阶段训练流水线、缺乏细粒度控制能力和部署后可控性的问题

Method: 使用统一共同训练框架，在单个SFT阶段集成积极、消极和拒绝类安全行为，通过系统指令或魔法标记动态控制

Result: 方法达到SFT+DPO的安全对齐质量，8B模型在安全性能上超过DeepSeek-R1(671B)，同时大幅降低训练复杂度和部署成本

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且高度可控的LLM内容安全解决方案

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

TL;DR: 提出了一个LLM驱动的文化本地化框架，用于自动生成包含本地化实体（人名、组织名、货币）的多语言数学应用题数据集，以解决现有翻译基准中英语中心实体偏见的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多语言数学推理基准主要通过翻译生成，保留了英语中心实体，缺乏真正的文化本地化数据集，导致低资源语言在文化相关的数学推理能力评估上存在偏差。

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够自动从现有数据源构建包含本地化实体（本地人名、组织名、货币）的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 实验表明，翻译基准可能掩盖真实的多语言数学能力，而本地化框架能够减轻英语中心实体偏见，在引入本地实体时提高模型在不同语言中的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建真正文化本地化的多语言数学推理数据集提供了有效解决方案，有助于更准确地评估LLM在不同文化背景下的数学推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了MultiCoXQL多语言数据集和Compass自定义输入数据集，用于改进多语言对话式可解释AI系统的意图识别和解析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于意图识别的ConvXAI系统在英语方面表现良好，但面临多语言训练数据稀缺和自定义输入支持有限的挑战。

Method: 扩展CoXQL数据集为MultiCoXQL（5种语言），提出新的解析方法，创建Compass数据集用于自定义输入提取，并使用不同规模的LLM和BERT模型进行评估。

Result: 在MultiCoXQL上评估了三种LLM的多种解析策略，在Compass上进行了单语、跨语言和多语言评估。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和方法有助于解决ConvXAI系统的多语言泛化问题和自定义输入支持限制。

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出奖励偏移推测采样算法(SSS)，通过对齐草稿模型而非目标模型，在降低推理成本的同时实现测试时对齐效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐技术虽然能提升LLM安全性和推理能力，但带来显著推理成本，限制了实际应用

Method: 基于推测采样思想，让草稿模型对齐人类偏好，目标模型保持不变，通过修改接受标准和奖励令牌分布来利用分布偏移

Result: 在测试时弱到强对齐实验中，以显著降低的推理成本获得更优的黄金奖励分数

Conclusion: SSS算法有效解决了测试时对齐的效率瓶颈问题，实现了效果和效率的双重提升

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [44] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall是一个三阶段召回评估框架，通过分解答案、筛选候选匹配和结构化蕴含检查来提升长文本问答的完整性评估准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学、法律等关键领域，机器生成文本的完整性至关重要，但现有召回指标依赖词汇重叠容易出错，LLM评估方法存在幻觉和对齐问题

Method: 三阶段框架：1)将答案分解为自包含事实 2)通过词汇和语义过滤逐步缩小候选匹配 3)通过结构化蕴含检查验证对齐

Result: 在三个长形式问答基准测试中，相比强基线方法在召回准确性上有显著提升

Conclusion: LongRecall为系统性召回评估提供了基础构建块，能减少假阳性和假阴性，适应多样化表达和上下文变化

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 结合大型语言模型与组合推理方法，通过符号推理提升结构化预测任务的准确性和一致性，并证明结构化学习在LLM时代仍有价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在语言任务中表现出色但存在幻觉和复杂推理问题，特别是在结构化预测任务中需要保持结构一致性

Method: 将LLMs与组合推理结合，探索不同提示策略来估计LLM置信度用于符号推理，并进行校准和基于结构化预测目标的微调

Result: 无论采用何种提示策略，在提示基础上添加符号推理都能产生更一致和准确的预测，结构化学习能提升困难任务的性能

Conclusion: 符号推理能有效提升LLMs在结构化预测中的表现，结构化学习在LLM时代仍然具有重要意义

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Nemotron-CC-Math，一个从Common Crawl构建的大规模高质量数学语料库，通过新颖的领域无关管道实现鲁棒的科学文本提取，显著提升LLM的数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Common Crawl的数学数据集因脆弱的提取启发式方法、有损的HTML到文本转换以及无法可靠保留数学结构而导致质量下降

Method: 使用布局感知渲染(lynx)和基于LLM的目标清洗阶段来恢复各种格式的数学内容，保持方程和代码块的结构完整性，同时去除样板文件、标准化为LaTeX表示并纠正不一致性

Result: 构建了Nemotron-CC-Math-3+(133B tokens)和Nemotron-CC-Math-4+(52B tokens)语料库，后者超越所有先前开放数学数据集，在MATH和MBPP+基准上分别获得+4.8到+12.6和+4.6到+14.3的提升

Conclusion: 这是第一个从噪声网络规模数据中可靠提取科学内容（包括数学）的管道，在数学、代码和一般推理方面产生可衡量的收益，并为开源社区发布代码和数据集

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用外部证据来识别和回答包含错误假设问题的方法，通过事实验证和原子假设生成来减少LLM的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理包含错误假设的问题时容易产生幻觉，生成误导性答案，需要有效方法来识别和纠正这些错误假设。

Method: 将问题简化为事实验证，利用外部检索证据，生成并验证原子假设，通过指定错误假设提供可解释的答案。

Result: 实验表明，整合检索证据有益，生成和验证原子假设能带来更大改进，并提供可解释的答案。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效减少LLM在处理错误假设问题时的幻觉，提高答案的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MMDR-Bench多模态对话推理基准和CoLVLM Agent框架，通过记忆-感知-规划-执行循环显著提升多模态模型的复杂对话推理能力，在多个维度超越GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型和视觉语言模型在处理复杂多轮视觉对话任务时存在上下文丢失、视觉幻觉等问题，现有基准无法充分评估真实世界多模态交互的复杂性。

Method: 构建包含300个复杂多轮对话场景的MMDR-Bench数据集；提出CoLVLM Agent框架，采用迭代式"记忆-感知-规划-执行"循环，无需重新训练底层模型即可增强推理和指令跟随能力。

Result: CoLVLM Agent在MMDR-Bench上获得平均4.03的人类评估分数，显著超越GPT-4o(3.92)和Gemini 1.5 Pro(3.85)，在推理深度、指令遵循和错误抑制方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模块化设计和迭代方法有效解决了复杂多模态交互的挑战，验证了在不重新训练基础模型的情况下显著提升多模态推理能力的可行性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [49] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken是一种语义感知的分词框架，通过语义聚类减少token冗余，在保持性能的同时实现2.4倍token减少和1.9倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法如BPE和WordPiece仅基于频率统计，忽略了文本的语义结构，导致语义冗余span的过度分词和上下文连贯性的利用不足

Method: 首先通过轻量级编码器提取上下文语义嵌入，进行局部语义聚类合并语义等价token；然后基于语义密度分配异质token粒度，在内容丰富区域使用细粒度分词，在重复或低熵区域使用粗粒度压缩

Result: 在WikiText-103和LongBench等长上下文语言建模基准测试中，SemToken实现了最多2.4倍的token减少和1.9倍的加速，困惑度和下游任务准确率几乎没有下降

Conclusion: 语义结构为优化大语言模型中的分词和计算提供了一个有前景的新方向

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

TL;DR: 提出了UniCoM流水线，通过SWORDS算法生成高质量代码切换语音样本，构建了CS-FLEURS多语言语料库，用于语音识别和语音翻译任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码切换(CS)现象在真实对话中普遍存在但缺乏合适数据集的问题，推动多语言语音技术的发展。

Method: 使用SWORDS算法，通过替换选定单词为其翻译（考虑词性）来生成CS语音，保持句子语义不变。

Result: CS-FLEURS语料库在可理解性和自然度方面表现优异，在客观和主观指标上与现有数据集相当。

Conclusion: 该方法能推动CS语音技术进步，实现更具包容性的多语言系统。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM是一个专门针对金融领域设计的流程奖励模型，通过整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，在金融推理任务中显著优于通用PRMs和领域基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs主要针对通用或STEM领域训练，在金融等专业领域中表现不足，因为金融推理更具结构化、符号化且对事实和监管准确性更敏感。

Method: 开发了Fin-PRM模型，整合步骤级和轨迹级奖励监督，支持离线/在线奖励学习，应用于监督微调、强化学习和测试时推理三个关键场景。

Result: 在CFLUE和FinQA基准测试中，Fin-PRM在轨迹选择质量上持续优于基线模型，下游模型性能提升显著：监督学习12.9%、强化学习5.2%、测试时性能5.1%。

Conclusion: 领域专业化奖励建模对于将LLMs与专家级金融推理对齐具有重要价值，Fin-PRM为金融领域提供了有效的中间推理监督框架。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: LLaSO是第一个完全开源的大规模语音语言建模端到端框架，包含对齐语料库、指令调优数据集和标准化评估基准，并发布了38亿参数的基准模型，为领域建立了可复现的开放标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语音语言模型发展受到碎片化架构和缺乏透明度的阻碍，社区普遍只发布模型权重而不公开训练数据和配置，导致研究难以系统比较和复现。

Method: 开发LLaSO框架，包含：1) LLaSO-Align语音文本对齐语料库(1200万实例)；2) LLaSO-Instruct多任务指令调优数据集(1350万实例)；3) LLaSO-Eval可复现评估基准；并训练了38亿参数的LLaSO-Base参考模型。

Result: LLaSO-Base模型获得0.72的标准化分数，超越了同类可比模型，建立了强大的可复现基线。分析显示更广泛的训练覆盖能提升性能，但在未见任务上仍存在显著泛化差距。

Conclusion: 通过完整发布数据、基准和模型堆栈，LLaSO为LSLM研究建立了基础性开放标准，有助于统一研究努力并加速社区驱动的进展。

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARK是一种无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存压缩方法，通过在通道级别应用非结构化稀疏性来减少内存使用和计算开销，同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要沿时间轴进行压缩，忽略了特征维度（通道轴）上的细粒度重要性变化，导致效率和模型准确性之间的平衡受限。

Method: 提出SPARK方法，在通道级别对KV进行剪枝，并在注意力分数计算过程中动态恢复被剪枝的条目，该方法与现有的KV压缩和量化技术正交兼容。

Result: SPARK在相同内存预算下可处理更长的序列，对等长序列可减少30%以上的KV缓存存储，即使在80%的激进剪枝比例下，性能下降也小于5%。

Conclusion: SPARK通过通道级别的稀疏性处理有效解决了KV缓存瓶颈问题，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升了内存效率和计算性能。

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) 是一个通过内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调来内化领域知识的框架，在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中表现优异，成本显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在领域特定场景中表现不佳，检索增强生成存在幻觉和延迟问题，持续预训练成本高且缺乏跨领域灵活性。领域知识的长尾分布导致部分有用内部知识未被充分利用。

Method: 提出Selct2Know框架，采用内部-外部知识自选择策略和选择性监督微调，引入结构化推理数据生成流程并集成GRPO来增强推理能力。

Result: 在医学、法律和金融QA基准测试中，S2K始终优于现有方法，并与领域预训练LLM表现相当，但成本显著降低。

Conclusion: S2K框架通过渐进式知识获取策略，有效解决了领域特定知识获取的挑战，实现了成本效益和性能的平衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER)方法，从持续更新的经验池中进行细粒度逐步检索，增量式扩展经验池并随时间改进模型性能

Result: 在ToolQA基准测试中，SEER在简单问题上平均提升6.1%，困难问题上提升4.7%；在τ-bench真实场景中，使用Qwen2.5-7B和72B模型分别获得7.44%和23.38%的准确率提升

Conclusion: SEER方法通过自引导的经验检索机制有效解决了LLM在多步工具调用中的挑战，实现了持续性能改进，为复杂工具使用场景提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

### [56] [Are Checklists Really Useful for Automatic Evaluation of Generative Tasks?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15218)
*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在生成任务自动评估中如何有效使用检查表，发现选择性使用检查表在成对比较任务中能提升评估性能，但在直接评分中效果不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成任务自动评估中面临标准模糊的挑战，自动检查表生成虽然是有前景的方法，但其有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 研究了检查表是否应选择性使用，使用六种方法生成检查表，在八种模型规模上评估其有效性，并识别与人工评估相关的检查表项目。通过成对比较和直接评分实验进行分析。

Result: 选择性使用检查表在成对比较设置中倾向于提高评估性能，但在直接评分中的益处不太一致。即使与人工评分相关性低的检查表项目也常反映人工编写的标准，表明人工评估存在潜在不一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调需要更清晰地定义客观评估标准，以指导人工和自动评估，提高评估的一致性和可靠性。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor是一个解耦的动态词汇选择框架，通过卸载嵌入和混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，在保持性能的同时将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型在边缘设备部署时面临内存限制瓶颈，词汇相关组件（嵌入和语言建模头）占用了大量内存，现有静态词汇剪枝方法存在信息损失和缺乏灵活性的问题

Method: 基于词汇局部性原理和计算不对称性，提出VocabTailor框架：卸载嵌入组件，为LM头实现混合静态-动态词汇选择策略，按需加载词汇组件

Result: 在多样化下游任务中，VocabTailor将词汇相关组件内存使用减少高达99%，性能损失极小或为零，显著优于现有静态词汇剪枝方法

Conclusion: VocabTailor通过动态词汇选择有效解决了SLM在边缘设备部署时的内存瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境中的高效语言模型部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在英语上表现优异，但在泰语等低资源语言中表现得不到充分研究。翻译的测试集缺乏文化和领域特定的细节，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 构建WangchanThaiInstruct数据集，包含四个专业领域和七种任务类型，通过注释员、领域专家和AI研究人员多阶段质量控制过程制作。进行两项研究：(1)零样本评估文化和专业特定任务的性能差距；(2)指令微调研究与消融实验分析本土监督的效果。

Result: 使用WangchanThaiInstruct微调的模型在领域内外的测试中都显著超过使用翻译数据的模型，证明本土化指令数据的优勃性。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于文化和专业知识的本土指令数据，才能有效提升大语言模型在低资源、语言多样性环境中的对齐性能力。

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EMNLP框架，用于评估教师角色大语言模型的人格特征、道德发展阶段和伦理风险，发现教师角色LLMs比人类教师更理想化和极化，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，且推理能力越强的模型越容易受到有害提示注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模拟职业角色的大语言模型缺乏全面的心理和伦理评估，特别是在教育领域需要评估教师角色的道德规范和心理特征。

Method: 开发EMNLP框架，扩展现有量表并构建88个教师特定道德困境，使用针对性软提示注入集评估教师角色LLMs的合规性和脆弱性，在12个LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 教师角色LLMs表现出比人类教师更理想化和极化的人格特征，在抽象道德推理上表现优异但在情感复杂情境中表现不佳，推理能力强的模型更容易受到有害提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估教师角色LLMs伦理和心理对齐的基准，揭示了能力与安全性之间的悖论，为教育AI的伦理评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在处理检索到的外部知识与LLM内部参数知识冲突时表现不佳，无法有效解决上下文-记忆冲突问题

Method: 提出Conflict-Aware RAG (CARE)框架，包含上下文评估器和基础LLM。上下文评估器通过压缩记忆令牌嵌入和对抗性软提示训练来识别不可靠上下文并指导推理

Result: 在QA和事实核查基准测试中平均性能提升5.0%，有效缓解了上下文-记忆冲突问题

Conclusion: CARE为构建可信赖和自适应的RAG系统提供了有前景的方向，能够更好地处理外部知识与内部知识的冲突

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用大语言模型自动挖掘时间常识的流程，构建了TComQA数据集，并在时间问答任务上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言中事件的时间上下文往往不明确表述，即使先进的大语言模型也难以生成需要时间常识推理的文本，因此需要自动挖掘时间常识来构建更鲁棒的语言模型。

Method: 提出了时间常识提取流程，利用大语言模型从SAMSum和RealNews语料库中自动挖掘时间常识，构建TComQA数据集，并通过众包验证数据质量。

Result: TComQA数据集在提取时间常识方面达到超过80%的精确度，基于该数据集训练的模型在时间问答任务上优于使用现有数据集微调的大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效自动挖掘时间常识，构建高质量数据集，提升模型在时间推理任务上的性能，为构建更鲁棒的语言模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE是一个轻量级语音模型，能够在120毫秒内捕捉关键音素特征，通过独立处理短固定窗口实现跨语言竞争性能，证明了通过建模音素长度窗口中的基本声学模式可以实现有效的通用语音处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多语音处理任务需要不受上下文影响的纯音素表示，但通用音素识别通常需要分析长语音段和语言特定模式，这促使开发CUPE模型来提供更纯粹的音素特征提取。

Method: CUPE处理短固定宽度窗口（约120毫秒，一个音素长度）并独立分析，通过学习所有语言共有的基本声学模式，使用比现有方法更少的参数实现跨语言性能。

Result: 通过在多种语言上进行监督和自监督训练的广泛评估，包括对UCLA语音语料库的零样本测试，证明了强大的跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 有效的通用语音处理可以通过建模音素长度窗口中的基本声学模式来实现，CUPE展示了这种方法的可行性。

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

TL;DR: 提出EDAS元度量方法，统一整合知识图谱补全模型在多数据集多指标下的性能评估，解决传统评估指标间的冲突问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱补全模型评估存在挑战，不同数据集和指标（如MRR、Hit@k）的评估结果经常不一致，难以进行整体性能比较和模型选择

Method: 基于距离平均解的评估方法（EDAS），将多数据集多指标的性能综合为单一标准化分数（0-1范围），提供全局视角

Result: 在FB15k-237和WN18RR等基准数据集上的实验表明，EDAS能有效统一多指标多数据集性能，提供一致、鲁棒和可泛化的评估框架

Conclusion: EDAS为知识图谱补全模型评估提供了更可靠、可解释的统一框架，支持更明智的模型选择并促进跨数据集评估的公平性

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

Conclusion: 需要创新的基准设计范式来解决当前评测体系的问题，以更全面、公平地评估大语言模型的性能

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估方法往往关注狭窄方面，忽视了多模态性带来的风险，需要建立一个全面的可信度评估框架来系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了MultiTrust-X基准，定义了三维框架：5个可信度方面（真实性、鲁棒性、安全性、公平性、隐私）、2种新型风险类型（多模态风险和跨模态影响）以及多种缓解策略（数据、模型架构、训练、推理算法）。包含32个任务和28个精选数据集，评估了30多个开源和专有MLLM。

Result: 实验揭示了当前模型的显著漏洞，包括可信度与通用能力之间的差距，以及多模态训练和推理对基础LLM潜在风险的放大。现有缓解策略存在关键局限性，大多数方法在改善特定方面的同时会带来意外的权衡，损害模型效用。

Conclusion: 提出了推理增强的安全对齐（RESA）方法，通过赋予模型思维链推理能力来发现潜在风险，取得了最先进的结果，为未来改进提供了实用见解，特别是在平衡安全性和性能方面。

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法使用静态生成长度和固定验证标准，无法适应不同模型不确定性和输入复杂度，限制了方法的适应性和效率

Method: 基于信息论的置信度调节推测解码框架，利用drafter输出分布的熵和边界不确定性度量，动态调整每轮推测生成的token数量，并使用相同置信度信号调节验证过程

Result: 在机器翻译和摘要任务上相比标准推测解码获得显著加速，同时保持或改进了BLEU和ROUGE分数

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性的即插即用方法，能在不同不确定性条件下实现大型语言模型的高效稳健解码

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究表明，更大的词汇表通过降低token化文本的复杂性来提升语言模型性能，主要受益于高频词的不确定性降低，而非解决词汇不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型词汇表对语言模型性能提升的真正原因，现有实践倾向于使用更大的词汇表但效益来源不明确。

Method: 进行控制实验，将词汇表从24K扩展到196K，保持数据、计算和优化不变，分析token化文本的复杂性变化和词级损失分解。

Result: 更大的词汇表主要通过降低前2500个高频词的不确定性来减少交叉熵，尽管稀有词的损失上升。约束嵌入范数会逆转收益，表明模型利用了而非受制于token频率不平衡。

Conclusion: 词汇表大小的效益应重新理解为降低token化文本复杂性的帮助，这为tokenizer-模型协同设计提供了简单原则性的杠杆，并阐明了预训练中语言模型扩展的损失动态。

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) has been accompanied
by growing concerns regarding their reliability and trustworthiness. As a
result, a growing body of research focuses on evidence-based text generation
with LLMs, aiming to link model outputs to supporting evidence to ensure
traceability and verifiability. However, the field is fragmented due to
inconsistent terminology, isolated evaluation practices, and a lack of unified
benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we systematically analyze 134 papers, introduce
a unified taxonomy of evidence-based text generation with LLMs, and investigate
300 evaluation metrics across seven key dimensions. Thereby, we focus on
approaches that use citations, attribution, or quotations for evidence-based
text generation. Building on this, we examine the distinctive characteristics
and representative methods in the field. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and outline promising directions for future work.

### [69] [When Audio and Text Disagree: Revealing Text Bias in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15407)
*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个专门评估大型音频语言模型处理冲突音频-文本对能力的基准MCR-BENCH，发现模型存在显著的文本偏向性，在模态冲突时倾向于忽略音频证据，导致音频中心任务性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在处理多模态输入方面取得进展，但其在音频和文本信息冲突时的表现尚未得到充分研究，需要建立专门的评估基准来揭示这一问题。

Method: 构建MCR-BENCH基准，包含不一致的音频-文本对，通过广泛评估不同音频理解任务来分析模型表现，研究影响因素，并通过监督微调探索缓解策略。

Result: 发现LALMs存在严重的文本偏向性，在模态冲突时经常忽视音频证据，导致音频任务性能显著下降；模型即使在矛盾输入下也表现出持续的过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了在训练过程中需要改进模态平衡和开发更复杂的融合机制，以增强处理冲突多模态输入时的鲁棒性。MCR-BENCH为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Conclusion: 该研究为隐私保护语言模型领域提供了价值较高的见解，并提出了未来研究的可能方向，有助于推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recent developments in language modeling have increased their use in various
applications and domains. Language models, often trained on sensitive data, can
memorize and disclose this information during privacy attacks, raising concerns
about protecting individuals' privacy rights. Preserving privacy in language
models has become a crucial area of research, as privacy is one of the
fundamental human rights. Despite its significance, understanding of how much
privacy risk these language models possess and how it can be mitigated is still
limited. This research addresses this by providing a comprehensive study of the
privacy-preserving language modeling approaches. This study gives an in-depth
overview of these approaches, highlights their strengths, and investigates
their limitations. The outcomes of this study contribute to the ongoing
research on privacy-preserving language modeling, providing valuable insights
and outlining future research directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言理解直接关系到翻译知识，非对应词汇（如食物、服装、文化和传统词汇）在不同语言中容易导致误解。虽然部分非对应词已经得到专业处理，但仍有许多词汇需要进一步研究和转换。

Method: 采用图书馆基础研究方法，研究从源语言向目标语言转换非对应词的不同方法和规则。

Conclusion: 这项研究为语言学家和翻译人员提供了专业的非对应词处理方法，有助于消除语言转换过程中的误解，对于提高翻译质量和深化语言理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

TL;DR: PyTOD是一个可编程的任务导向对话代理，通过生成可执行代码来跟踪对话状态，并利用策略和执行反馈进行高效错误纠正，在SGD基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可编程任务导向对话代理的有效性依赖于准确的状态跟踪，但传统方法存在局限性，需要更有效的状态跟踪和错误纠正机制。

Method: PyTOD采用简单的约束解码方法，使用语言模型而非语法规则来遵循API模式，生成可执行代码进行状态跟踪，并利用策略和执行反馈进行错误纠正。

Result: 在具有挑战性的SGD基准测试中，PyTOD实现了最先进的状态跟踪性能，在准确性和鲁棒性用户目标估计方面均超越了强基线模型。

Conclusion: 执行感知的状态跟踪方法非常有效，PyTOD通过代码生成和反馈机制显著提升了对话状态跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

*Yingshu Li,Yunyi Liu,Lingqiao Liu,Lei Wang,Luping Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason是一个新颖的放射学报告评估框架，提供细粒度错误类型评分和可解释的临床依据，在保持成本效益的同时达到与GPT-4相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告自动评估方法要么评分过于粗糙，要么依赖不透明的黑盒模型，缺乏临床可解释性和细粒度分析能力，限制了在真实临床工作流程中的应用。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization，创新性地引入：1）子分数动态加权，根据实时F1统计自适应优先处理临床挑战性错误类型；2）多数引导优势缩放，基于子分数一致性调整策略梯度更新。

Result: 在ReXVal基准测试中，RadReason超越了所有现有离线指标，达到与GPT-4评估相当的性能，同时保持可解释性、成本效益和临床部署适用性。

Conclusion: RadReason提供了一个临床可解释、细粒度的放射学报告评估解决方案，通过创新的动态加权和优势缩放机制实现了稳定优化和与专家临床判断的更好对齐。

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.
Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: SLM4Offer是一个基于对比学习的生成式AI模型，通过微调T5-Small模型，在个性化营销报价生成任务上实现了17%的接受率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化营销能显著提升转化率和客户满意度，现有研究显示良好执行的个性化策略可增加40%收入，但现有研究主要关注推荐系统和个性化广告，报价生成领域潜力巨大

Method: 使用对比学习方法微调Google的T5-Small模型，采用InfoNCE损失函数在共享嵌入空间中对齐客户画像和相关报价，通过对比损失引入自适应学习行为重塑潜在空间

Result: 在模拟客户行为和报价接受模式的合成数据集上评估，相比监督微调基线模型，报价接受率提升了17%

Conclusion: 对比学习目标在推进个性化营销方面非常有效，SLM4Offer模型展示了在个性化报价生成任务上的优越性能

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种聚类语言模型训练方法HeTLM，用于处理用户浏览行为的主观性和异质性，证明小型模型在浏览语言表现上超过大型模型，并能提高用户级别对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑大语言模型是否能够有效处理用户主观性和异质性的浏览行为，这些行为构成了每个用户独特的"浏览语言"。

Method: 提出HeTLM聚类语言模型训练方法，使用页面级别的tokenizer训练小型模型，并通过异质聚类特定参数集来处理不同用户群体的行为偏好。

Result: 小型LM在浏览语言表现上超过大型预训练或微调模型；HeTLM在控制参数数量同等情况下超过单一模型；实现了更高的平均性能和更低的方差，改善了用户级别对齐效果。

Conclusion: 对于主观性行为分析，专门训练的小型模型和考虑异质性的聚类方法比单一大型模型更有效，能够更好地捕捉用户的个性化偏好并提高对齐性。

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究提出使用训练数据影响力作为模型中心化的难度度量，替代传统以人为中心的难度指标，在语言模型预训练中实现了超过10个百分点的性能提升，证明了课程学习在采用更合适的难度定义时的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习在语言模型预训练中效果有限，主要是因为使用人类定义的难度指标（如文档复杂度）可能无法准确反映模型训练过程中的实际难度。

Method: 使用训练数据影响力作为难度度量标准，该分数估计单个训练样本对模型输出的影响程度，然后按照这个模型中心的难度指标对训练样本进行排序（从简单到复杂）。

Result: 采用基于训练数据影响力的课程学习方法，在基准测试中比随机顺序训练的性能提高了超过10个百分点。

Conclusion: 课程学习对语言模型预训练是有益的，但关键在于采用更符合模型训练特性的模型中心化难度定义，而不是传统的人类中心化难度指标。

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) offer computational efficiency and
accessibility, yet a systematic evaluation of their performance and
environmental impact remains lacking. We introduce SLM-Bench, the first
benchmark specifically designed to assess SLMs across multiple dimensions,
including accuracy, computational efficiency, and sustainability metrics.
SLM-Bench evaluates 15 SLMs on 9 NLP tasks using 23 datasets spanning 14
domains. The evaluation is conducted on 4 hardware configurations, providing a
rigorous comparison of their effectiveness. Unlike prior benchmarks, SLM-Bench
quantifies 11 metrics across correctness, computation, and consumption,
enabling a holistic assessment of efficiency trade-offs. Our evaluation
considers controlled hardware conditions, ensuring fair comparisons across
models. We develop an open-source benchmarking pipeline with standardized
evaluation protocols to facilitate reproducibility and further research. Our
findings highlight the diverse trade-offs among SLMs, where some models excel
in accuracy while others achieve superior energy efficiency. SLM-Bench sets a
new standard for SLM evaluation, bridging the gap between resource efficiency
and real-world applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社会身份检测数据集主要针对英语、单标签且类别粗糙，缺乏对希伯来语等非英语政治语境中多标签细粒度身份表达的研究。

Method: 构建HebID语料库（5536个句子），手动标注12种社会身份，基于调查数据。评估多标签和单标签编码器以及2B-9B参数生成式LLM，应用分类器分析政客的社交媒体帖子和议会演讲。

Result: 希伯来语调优的LLM表现最佳（macro-F1=0.74），分析发现了受欢迎程度差异、时间趋势、聚类模式以及身份表达中的性别差异。

Conclusion: HebID为希伯来语社会身份研究提供了全面基础，可作为其他非英语政治语境类似研究的模型，实现了精英话语与公众身份优先级的比较。

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

Abstract: We introduce Dream 7B, the most powerful open diffusion large language model
to date. Unlike autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens sequentially,
Dream 7B employs discrete diffusion modeling to refine sequences in parallel
through iterative denoising. Our model consistently outperforms existing
diffusion language models on general, mathematical, and coding tasks. Dream 7B
demonstrates superior planning abilities and inference flexibility, including
arbitrary-order generation, infilling capabilities, and tunable quality-speed
trade-offs. These results are achieved through simple yet effective training
techniques, including AR-based LLM initialization and context-adaptive
token-level noise rescheduling. We release both Dream-Base and Dream-Instruct
to facilitate further research in diffusion-based language modeling.

TL;DR: 首个大规模政治去合法化话语(PDD)计算研究，构建希伯来语语料库并开发两阶段分类模型，发现PDD在30年间显著增长，社交媒体中更常见，右翼政客使用更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政治去合法化话语(PDD)对理解民主话语质量至关重要，但缺乏大规模计算分析。需要开发自动化方法来系统研究PDD的模式和趋势。

Method: 构建包含10,410句希伯来语语料库，手动标注1,812个PDD实例。开发两阶段分类流水线，结合微调编码器模型和解码器LLM。最佳模型DictaLM 2.0用于PDD检测和特征分类。

Result: 模型在二元PDD检测上F1=0.74，特征分类macro-F1=0.67。发现PDD在过去30年显著增长，社交媒体比议会辩论更常见，男性政客比女性使用更多，右翼行为者倾向更强，选举期间和重大政治事件时出现峰值。

Conclusion: 研究证明了自动化PDD分析的可行性和价值，为理解民主话语提供了重要工具，揭示了政治去合法化话语的时间趋势和平台差异。

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Method: 设计包含7个专门化智能体的SafetyFlow系统，通过编排这些智能体并配备多样化工具，实现自动化构建安全基准的流程，同时整合人类专业知识。

Result: 构建的SafetyFlowBench数据集包含23,446个低冗余、强区分度的查询，并在49个先进LLM上进行了安全评估，验证了系统的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: SafetyFlow成功实现了首个完全自动化的基准构建流程，为LLM安全评估提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著优于传统人工方法。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has intensified the
requirement for reliable safety evaluation to uncover model vulnerabilities. To
this end, numerous LLM safety evaluation benchmarks are proposed. However,
existing benchmarks generally rely on labor-intensive manual curation, which
causes excessive time and resource consumption. They also exhibit significant
redundancy and limited difficulty. To alleviate these problems, we introduce
SafetyFlow, the first agent-flow system designed to automate the construction
of LLM safety benchmarks. SafetyFlow can automatically build a comprehensive
safety benchmark in only four days without any human intervention by
orchestrating seven specialized agents, significantly reducing time and
resource cost. Equipped with versatile tools, the agents of SafetyFlow ensure
process and cost controllability while integrating human expertise into the
automatic pipeline. The final constructed dataset, SafetyFlowBench, contains
23,446 queries with low redundancy and strong discriminative power. Our
contribution includes the first fully automated benchmarking pipeline and a
comprehensive safety benchmark. We evaluate the safety of 49 advanced LLMs on
our dataset and conduct extensive experiments to validate our efficacy and
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本生成方面表现优异，但计算成本高昂，特别是在销售和营销等具体应用场景中成本不可行

Method: 提出"训练美纸"概念，通过细调小型语言模型(SLMs)专门适配高价值的具体应用场景

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in text generation; however, these
creative elements require heavy computation and are accompanied by a steep
cost. Especially for targeted applications such as sales and marketing
outreach, these costs are far from feasible. This paper introduces the concept
of "Trained Miniatures" - Small Language Models(SLMs) fine-tuned for specific,
high-value applications, generating similar domain-specific responses for a
fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: SDGO是一个自判别引导的强化学习框架，通过利用LLM自身的判别能力作为奖励信号来增强生成安全性，无需额外标注数据或外部模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLM作为判别器识别有害请求的能力强于作为生成器防御有害内容的能力，这种安全不一致性促使研究者探索对齐模型的判别和生成能力。

Method: 提出SDGO强化学习框架，利用模型自身的判别能力作为奖励信号，通过迭代自我改进来增强生成安全性。

Result: SDGO显著提高了模型安全性，在保持通用基准上有用性的同时，对分布外越狱攻击表现出鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 通过对齐判别和生成能力，SDGO实现了两种能力的紧密耦合，仅需少量判别样本即可进一步增强模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学综述文章对总结研究进展至关重要，但由于学术文献快速增长，手动创建变得不可行。虽然大语言模型有自动化潜力，但缺乏标准化基准和评估协议阻碍了进展。

Method: 构建SurGE基准，包括：(1)测试实例集（主题描述、专家撰写综述及引用文献）(2)百万级学术论文语料库作为检索池。提出自动化评估框架，从信息覆盖度、引用准确性、结构组织和内容质量四个维度评估。

Result: 对各种基于LLM的方法评估表明，即使使用先进的自反思框架，综述生成仍然极具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该任务复杂度高，需要持续研究。所有代码、数据和模型均已开源。

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and
models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE

TL;DR: Pos2Distill是一个位置到位置的知识蒸馏框架，通过将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置来缓解长上下文处理中的位置偏差问题，在检索和推理任务中都取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 位置偏差（PB）表现为不同上下文位置的非均匀敏感性，严重损害了长上下文理解和处理能力。现有方法通过修改架构来缓解PB，但显著的位置偏差仍然存在。

Method: 提出了Pos2Distill框架，利用位置引起的固有差异来抵消位置偏差本身。针对检索和推理范式设计了两个专门实例：Pos2Distill-R¹和Pos2Distill-R²，通过知识蒸馏将优势位置的能力转移到劣势位置。

Result: 使用Pos2Distill方法在长上下文检索和推理任务中实现了增强的均匀性和显著的性能提升。两个专门系统都表现出强大的跨任务泛化能力，同时在各自任务上达到优异性能。

Conclusion: Pos2Distill通过位置到位置的知识蒸馏有效缓解了位置偏差问题，在长上下文处理任务中取得了显著改进，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对孟加拉语词干提取方法进行全面调查，指出该领域存在显著研究空白，强调需要开发更强大的词干提取工具来支持这种低资源高屈折语言的处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为全球第七大语言拥有3亿母语者，但在数字领域代表性不足，缺乏标注数据集和资源。词干提取作为语言分析的关键预处理步骤，对孟加拉语这种低资源高屈折语言尤为重要。

Method: 通过全面调查现有的孟加拉语词干提取方法，分析文献中的研究空白，批判现有评估方法，并提出发展方向建议。

Result: 发现现有研究存在明显断层，缺乏可复现的实现方案，评估指标不够相关，需要更适应孟加拉语丰富形态和方言多样性的解决方案。

Conclusion: 建议开发更强大的孟加拉语词干提取器，持续进行研究以提升语言分析和处理能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

TL;DR: 提出了EcomMMMU电商多模态数据集和SUMEI方法，发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低表现，通过预测视觉效用策略性利用多图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电商平台拥有丰富的多模态数据，但现有数据集规模有限，难以系统研究图像是否真正增强产品理解，还是可能引入冗余或降低性能

Method: 构建包含406,190样本和8,989,510图像的EcomMMMU数据集，包含8个关键任务和VSS子集；提出SUMEI方法，通过预测视觉效用来策略性利用多图像进行下游任务

Result: 分析发现产品图像并不总是提升性能，有时反而会降低表现，表明MLLMs在有效利用丰富视觉内容方面存在困难；SUMEI方法在综合实验中显示出有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 电商多模态理解中需要更智能的图像选择策略，SUMEI方法通过数据驱动的方式有效解决了多图像利用问题，为MLLMs在电商任务中的应用提供了新思路

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/submission25.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大语言模型在诊断中存在知识鸿沟和幻觉问题，现有的检索增强方法对外部知识利用不足且缺乏反馈-推理可追溯性，需要开发更有效的诊断辅助系统。

Method: 构建大规模医学检索语料库（患者记录和可靠医学知识），将LLM作为核心代理，检索语料库作为环境，通过强化学习训练代理RAG策略，使用格式、检索、推理结构和诊断准确性等多维度奖励。

Result: 在多个数据中心超越提示工程和无训练RAG方法，诊断准确性显著提升，优于GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1等强基线模型，在分布内和分布外设置下对常见和罕见疾病都表现优异。

Conclusion: Deep-DxSearch通过端到端强化学习训练框架有效解决了医疗诊断中的知识鸿沟问题，奖励设计和检索语料库组件对性能提升至关重要，为临床医生提供了更可靠精确的初步诊断支持。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

TL;DR: ReasonZoo基准测试表明，工具集成推理(TIR)能显著提升大语言模型在数学和非数学推理任务中的表现，并通过新指标PAC和AUC-PCC证明TIR提高了推理效率，减少了过度思考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在推理任务上取得进展，但在精确计算任务中仍存在不足。工具集成推理(TIR)被提出作为解决方案，但其泛化效果和对模型推理行为的改善程度尚不明确。

Method: 提出了ReasonZoo基准测试，涵盖九个不同的推理类别，用于评估TIR在不同领域的有效性。同时提出了两个新指标：性能感知成本(PAC)和性能-成本曲线下面积(AUC-PCC)来评估推理效率。

Result: 实证评估显示，启用TIR的模型在数学和非数学任务中都持续优于非TIR模型。TIR提高了推理效率，表现为改进的PAC和AUC-PCC指标，表明减少了过度思考并实现了更简化的推理过程。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了TIR的领域通用优势及其在提升大语言模型复杂推理任务能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various
domains. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics, Performance-Aware Cost
(PAC) and Area Under the Performance-Cost Curve (AUC-PCC), to assess reasoning
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that TIR-enabled models
consistently outperform their non-TIR counterparts in both mathematical and
non-mathematical tasks. Furthermore, TIR enhances reasoning efficiency, as
evidenced by improved PAC and AUC-PCC, indicating reduced overthinking and more
streamlined reasoning. These findings underscore the domain-general benefits of
TIR and its potential to advance LLM capabilities in complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Tool calling has emerged as a critical capability for AI agents to interact
with the real world and solve complex tasks. While the Model Context Protocol
(MCP) provides a powerful standardized framework for tool integration, there is
a significant gap in benchmarking how well AI agents can effectively solve
multi-step tasks using diverse MCP tools in realistic, dynamic scenarios. In
this work, we present LiveMCP-101, a benchmark of 101 carefully curated
real-world queries, refined through iterative LLM rewriting and manual review,
that require coordinated use of multiple MCP tools including web search, file
operations, mathematical reasoning, and data analysis. Moreover, we introduce a
novel evaluation approach that leverages ground-truth execution plans rather
than raw API outputs, better reflecting the evolving nature of real-world
environments. Experiments show that even frontier LLMs achieve a success rate
below 60\%, highlighting major challenges in tool orchestration. Detailed
ablations and error analysis further reveal distinct failure modes and
inefficiencies in token usage, pointing to concrete directions for advancing
current models. LiveMCP-101 sets a rigorous standard for evaluating real-world
agent capabilities, advancing toward autonomous AI systems that reliably
execute complex tasks through tool use.

Motivation: 当前基于热图回归的面部关键点检测方法普遍使用Soft-argmax作为argmax的可微分近似，但作者认为这不是实现高性能的唯一途径，需要探索替代方案

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，避免了Soft-argmax的使用，实现了端到端的可微分训练

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，训练收敛速度比传统方法快2.2倍，同时保持更好/相当的精度

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非面部关键点检测中实现高性能的唯一选择，提出的结构化预测方法提供了更优的替代方案，在精度和训练效率方面都有显著提升

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，需要一种能够更好建模关系数据的方法来提升图像分类性能，特别是在处理复杂场景和细粒度类别时。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构（像素或区域作为顶点），使用Voronoi图和对应的Delaunay三角剖分来优化图表示，然后应用图卷积网络进行分类。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了显著的预处理效率提升和分类准确率改进，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了最先进的方法，实验结果通过交叉验证得到验证。

Conclusion: GCN与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类提供了新的视角，拓展了基于图的学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计作为2D检测的自然扩展，仅使用RGB图像就实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要更简单的仅RGB替代方案，直接在类别级别学习，统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1%的10°10cm指标，超越所有仅RGB方法，缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段、仅RGB的方法可以在类别级9自由度姿态估计任务中实现高性能，无需额外数据或复杂多阶段流程。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Conclusion: 该统一框架能够高效处理多模态攻击，减少系统复杂性和延迟，具有实际部署的实用性

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for

Motivation: 现有生成式对抗攻击方法生成的图像质量低且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但需要数百步采样步骤

Method: 在混合步骤区间注入扰动，采用选择性RGB通道策略：对红色通道使用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Conclusion: TAIGen是最具影响力的对抗攻击方法，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，实现了最低的鲁棒准确率

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在mask和RGB双域应用可逆建模，并利用扩散模型处理不确定性区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CVP方法主要局限于mask域，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且在处理不确定性方面存在局限

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题并展开为多阶段深度网络，包含CORE（mask域可逆建模）、CARE（RGB域可逆建模）和FINE（Bernoulli扩散模型细化）三个模块

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式细化的独特协同，为CVP系统提供了新的双域优化框架，显著提升了隐蔽目标感知性能

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow提出了一种新的流匹配框架，通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，显著提升了文本到图像生成的语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有整流流模型基于数据与噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能导致图像生成过程经过数据流形的低概率区域。需要探索轨迹曲率如何影响生成图像与文本描述的语义对齐。

Method: 引入CurveFlow框架，通过曲率指导直接融入流路径来学习平滑的非线性轨迹，采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成方面达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线，在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高质量的图像生成效果。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和对齐学习实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真场景下都表现出优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏差和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实失真（镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量级变体HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过分层排序和对齐学习实现了强大的自监督图像质量评估，具有良好的泛化能力和实时部署潜力，为无参考IQA提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

Motivation: 应急响应、战术场景等关键应用需要近实时3D重建，但边缘环境的动态性和操作逆境会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的方法，使用遗传算法解决优化问题，选择相机组合以应对时空相关中断

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上验证，相比传统基线策略，该方法能保证可靠的3D重建质量

Conclusion: 提出的相机选择策略能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保3D重建的可靠性

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM通过提供稳健且可解释的洞察，成功弥合了自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距，为糖尿病视网膜病变的可解释AI诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

Result: 该方法在几何对齐和生成质量方面优于现有方法，生成的场景可通过重照明和风格迁移技术以不同风格渲染。

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型纹理生成的挑战，为虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶提供了高质量的3D场景合成解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Conclusion: 该研究为手术伤口筛查提供了重要的数据集和工具，有助于实现个性化伤口护理、及时干预和改善患者预后，推动了手术伤口诊断自动化的发展。

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个基于多模态（RGB、RGBD、点云）的前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过协作多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型，有效利用多模态数据的互补优势，在少量训练数据下实现高质量3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型大多局限于单模态或纯3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势（如RGB图像的丰富纹理和点云的精细几何），且受限于训练数据集范围。

Method: 1）引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2）采用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3）基于三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产。

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态，在使用少量训练数据的情况下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能，并在RGB-D数据集上验证了扩展多模态数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: TriMM成功展示了多模态数据在3D生成中的价值，为利用多样化模态数据提升3D内容生成质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

TL;DR: 提出了双高度无人机协同视觉语言导航任务(DuAl-VLN)，通过高低空无人机协作解决复杂户外导航问题，并构建了包含13,838条轨迹的HaL-13k数据集和AeroDuo框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机视觉语言导航面临轨迹长、机动性复杂的挑战，需要利用无人机多粒度视角优势同时保持可控的运动空间。

Method: 采用双无人机协作框架：高空无人机负责环境推理，低空无人机负责精确导航；提出AeroDuo框架，高空无人机使用多模态大语言模型进行目标推理，低空无人机使用轻量级多阶段策略进行导航和目标定位。

Result: 构建了HaL-13k数据集，包含13,838条协作轨迹和面向目标的语言指令，包含未见地图和未见对象验证集以评估泛化能力。

Conclusion: 双无人机协作方法能够有效利用高低空视角优势，通过最小坐标信息交换实现高效协作，为解决复杂户外无人机导航问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种跳过步采样机制，通过马尔可夫方式实现扩散模型加速采样，证明这是预训练扩散模型的内在属性，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型需要顺序生成过程，采样步骤多效率低。虽然DDIM等方法尝试减少采样步骤，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否通过马尔可夫方式实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，与传统逐步细化方法形成对比。该方法与标准扩散模型具有相同的训练目标，并将加速采样技术与DDIM集成。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能够以显著减少的采样步骤实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性，通过马尔可夫方式实现加速采样是可行的，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程，为扩散模型的高效生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Motivation: 传统图像编解码器编码模式有限且依赖工程师手动选择，对非专业用户不友好，需要更智能的交互式压缩解决方案。

Method: 提出三创新：多功能编码框架统一不同目标需求；交互式编码代理使用增强上下文学习方法；建立IIC-bench专用评估基准。

Result: 实验证明Comp-X能高效理解编码请求，具备优秀文本交互能力，单一框架下保持可比压缩性能。

Conclusion: 为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的研究方向，推动了图像编码范式的演进。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing
anomaly detection methods, primarily designed for industrial settings, face
limitations in pathology due to computational constraints, diverse tissue

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa
enhances accuracy and robustness to variability in pathology images and

TL;DR: RATopo是一种冗余分配策略，通过交换Transformer解码器的注意力层顺序和并行交叉注意力块，实现一对多分配，提升车道拓扑推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用先检测后推理的范式，基于一对一分配进行监督，导致拓扑推理性能受限，因为有效监督范围有限。

Method: 重构Transformer解码器，交换交叉注意力和自注意力层的顺序，保留冗余车道预测；实例化多个并行交叉注意力块以增强车道检测多样性。

Result: 在OpenLane-V2数据集上的大量实验表明，RATopo策略与模型无关，可无缝集成到现有拓扑推理框架中，持续提升车道-车道和车道-交通拓扑性能。

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal
approaches in advancing patent analysis. The codebase is available here:

TL;DR: TPA是一种用于胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类的新方法，结合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，在CHD检测和心功能评估方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在图像噪声、探头位置变异性问题，且现有机器学习方法常忽略时序信息、仅限于二元分类、缺乏预测校准。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)方法：使用图像编码器提取视频子片段帧特征，通过可训练时序提取器聚合特征捕捉心脏运动，使用边际铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别特定文本提示；引入条件变分自编码器风格调制(CVAESM)模块学习潜在风格向量调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Result: 在CHD检测上达到85.40%的宏F1分数，预期校准误差降低5.38%，自适应ECE降低6.8%；在EchoNet-Dynamic三分类任务上宏F1提升4.73%(从53.89%到58.62%)。

Conclusion: TPA框架成功整合了时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，为胎儿先天性心脏病超声视频分类提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了分类性能和临床可靠性。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: LiDAR与摄像头融合的多模态方法能够有效解决篮球运动中的实时3D追踪难题，为体育分析提供新的技术途径

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

<details>

Motivation: 现有COD方法需要大量训练和计算资源，而基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示才能处理COD任务，手动生成提示成本高且低效。

Method: 将COD解耦为两个阶段：1）RAG阶段通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库生成粗掩码提示；2）SEG阶段使用SAM2进行精细分割。整个流程无需训练。

Result: 在基准COD数据集上的大量实验表明，RAG-SEG的性能达到或超越了最先进方法，所有实验均在个人笔记本上完成，证明了计算效率和实用性。

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效COD解决方案，通过检索增强生成和SAM分割的结合，在保持竞争力的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

Conclusion: VideoEraser在抑制文本到视频生成中的不良内容方面达到了最先进的性能，为解决扩散模型的隐私、版权和安全问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

Motivation: 深度学习在图像分析中取得了显著进展，但大型全训练模型的计算需求仍然是一个考虑因素。传统微调方法通常更新所有模型参数，可能导致过拟合和更高的计算成本。

Method: BioTune采用进化算法来识别用于微调的聚焦层集合，旨在优化模型在给定目标任务上的性能。通过选择性地微调相关层子集，减少可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 通过将微调过程集中在相关层子集上，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，可能降低计算成本，并促进跨不同数据特征和分布的更高效迁移学习。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

TL;DR: 提出ICGS-Quantizer方法，通过联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用跨场景共享码本，将3DGS压缩到千字节级别，并支持基于图像的场景更新


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合，且缺乏对长期归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 图像条件化高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用固定共享码本，编码、量化和解码过程联合训练，支持基于捕获图像的场景解码

Conclusion: ICGS-Quantizer显著提升了3DGS的压缩效率，实现了千字节级别的压缩，并提供了对归档后场景变化的适应能力

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的运动模糊和几何精度问题，为自动驾驶等应用提供了高质量的场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Result: 实验发现DIO模型的互信息最大化优化目标无法让模型真正获得预定义的人类推理逻辑

Conclusion: 需要克服互信息下界紧致性和统计度量局限，通过渐进改进方法来提升模型的因果推理能力

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Method: 设计基于SNN的关键帧提取器，引入动态聚合图推理器解耦上下文对象一致性和语义连贯性，使用变分推理重建模块处理多通道特征融合的不确定性和噪声。

Result: 在SumMe、TVSum、VideoXum和QFVS等多个数据集上超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合脉冲神经网络和变分推理，有效提升了视频摘要的性能和鲁棒性，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

Conclusion: 研究为实践中如何选择MAE超参数提供了理论见解，特别是掩码比例和补丁大小对捕捉不同范围空间相关性的影响。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Conclusion: 提出的双向时序信息传播方法有效解决了现有滑动窗口方法的局限性，在红外小目标检测任务中取得了优异的效果

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和预训练策略，显著提升了视频到视频时刻检索的性能，证明了其在复杂视频语义匹配任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for

method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习解决模态不对齐、高频细节破坏等问题，在多个融合任务中表现出色且计算高效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合框架来克服这些限制

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行高效的多模态跨域融合

Result: 在红外-可见光图像融合、多焦点图像融合、多曝光图像融合和医学图像融合四个任务上的广泛实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效提升了多模态图像融合的质量和泛化能力，在性能和效率之间实现了良好平衡

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过创新的高斯表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于生成先验的方法在外推驾驶场景时存在几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉真实性的解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示、使用可学习缩放因子的远场高斯(FFG)，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性地集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了驾驶场景外推中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶仿真提供了更高质量的合成视图。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程处理多对象交互和复杂运动，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：运动初始化和运动细化。第一阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；第二阶段使用基于组的位移网络(GDN)细化动画，预测组特定位移场，并利用文本到视频模型的先验知识。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的复杂多对象草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，有效解决了多对象交互和复杂运动的动画生成问题。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一种用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度狭窄道路分割的深度学习网络，通过差分注意力扩张提取、双流解码融合和多尺度扩张策略，有效解决了狭窄道路宽度有限、拓扑破碎和遮挡严重的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中的狭窄道路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑破碎和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过度拟合通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征并抑制背景噪声；2）双流解码融合机制整合原始特征和注意力调制特征；3）多尺度扩张策略（1,3,5,9）减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet是复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度狭窄道路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件特征分布，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在各种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，影响决策边界可靠性和预测校准。

Method: 将测试时自适应重新构建为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正可能的似然偏差。

Result: 在多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移范围内实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完全访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INR)存在频谱偏置问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻域感知软掩码对局部变化强烈的像素赋予更高权重，引导模型早期关注高频细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续提升重建质量，并与现有INR方法形成互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏置问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

Motivation: 现有的基于半定规划松弛的全局最优方法对于100个点的配准问题需要数百秒，计算效率低下，需要更快的全局最优求解方法。

Method: 提出线性时间凸松弛和contractor方法来加速分支定界算法，专注于旋转轴已知的情况。

Result: 能够在0.5秒内求解100个点的3D点云配准问题，比STRIDE SDP求解器快两个数量级，并提供全局最优性证明。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了点云配准的求解效率，虽然目前仅适用于旋转轴已知的情况，但在该设定下实现了计算性能的突破性提升。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

Abstract: Wildlife and human activities are key components of landscape systems.
Understanding their spatial distribution is essential for evaluating human
wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with
automated object detection enhances wildlife surveillance and landscape
management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在整体推理方面取得显著进展，但在时序感知方面仍然粗糙：时间戳仅隐式编码、帧级特征连续性捕捉能力弱、语言视觉对齐容易偏离目标实体。

Method: 1) 扩散时序潜在(DTL)编码器增强边界敏感性和保持时序一致性；2) 对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体到局部视觉证据；3) 混合令牌方案包含离散时序令牌，提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，验证了强大的接地能力。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过三项关键创新成功克服了现有视频LLM的时序感知局限性，为细粒度时序推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据树木分割面临数据变异大和精确标注成本高的问题，需要开发弱监督方法降低标注需求

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，人工进行质量评级，训练评分模型分类分割质量，最后用评分模型反馈微调分割模型

Result: 方法使正确识别的树木实例增加34%，同时显著减少非树木实例的预测，但在稀疏林区和小树木（低于2米）或复杂环境（灌木、岩石等）中性能仍有局限

Conclusion: 弱监督方法有效提升了树木实例分割性能并减少了错误预测，但在特定复杂场景下仍需进一步改进

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出信息，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以保证不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于现有最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击场景下表现出色

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: MapKD成功实现了从多模态到纯视觉模型的知识转移，为自动驾驶系统提供了高效低成本的在线高清地图构建方案

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出MDPR框架，通过多维度动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差累积

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token与通用查询token之间的注意力分数来压缩KV缓存，同时维护固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，并与查询感知压缩方法相竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem提供了一种高效的流式视频理解解决方案，能够在内存受限的环境中处理长视频，为多模态大语言模型的长视频应用提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，在长序列中会导致对象结构和运动误差累积，需要解决长时间结构一致性问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息，利用深度线索构建记忆库保存上下文信息，采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在基于扩散和整流流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移并提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长时间建模方案，显著提升了长视频生成的时间一致性和质量，为解决长序列视频生成中的结构漂移问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在细粒度语义分割方面存在挑战，特别是在识别特定细胞亚型时表现不佳。需要开发能够利用分子信息并减少标注需求的新方法。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1）分子赋能的标注参与减少像素级标注需求；2）通过SAM适配器调整模型以关注特定语义；3）整合分子导向校正学习（MOCL）来提高分割精度。

Result: 在内部和公共数据集上的实验表明，All-in-SAM模型显著提高了细胞分类性能，即使在标注质量不同的情况下也能保持良好表现。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅减轻了标注人员的工作负担，还将精确的生物医学图像分析扩展到资源有限的环境中，推动了医学诊断和病理图像分析的自动化进程。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance

quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个从60万高分辨率扫描中学习的高保真人体模型，通过将网格表示基于人体骨骼来显式解耦形状和骨骼基，解决了现有方法在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系，限制了直接控制身体高度和骨骼长度的能力。

Method: 从600k高分辨率扫描数据学习，使用240个同步相机捕获。显式解耦形状和骨骼基，将网格表示基于人体骨骼，实现增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制和独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合。

Result: ATLAS在拟合未见过的多样化姿态主体方面优于现有方法，定量评估显示非线性姿态校正比线性模型更有效地捕捉复杂姿态。

Conclusion: 通过基于骨骼的显式解耦方法，ATLAS实现了更高保真的人体建模，解决了现有方法在形状表达和骨骼控制方面的限制，为人体建模提供了更准确和可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Motivation: 扩散模型在指令引导图像编辑中存在全局去噪过程导致编辑区域与整个图像上下文纠缠的问题，会产生意外的伪修改并影响编辑指令的遵循度。自回归模型提供了因果和组合机制的自然优势。

Method: 提出VAREdit框架，将图像编辑重新定义为下一尺度预测问题。通过源图像特征和文本指令条件化，生成多尺度目标特征。引入尺度对齐参考(SAR)模块，在第一个自注意力层注入尺度匹配的条件信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GPT-Balance分数比领先的扩散方法高出30%以上。512×512图像编辑仅需1.2秒，比同等规模的UltraEdit快2.2倍。

Conclusion: VAREdit在编辑遵循度和效率方面都取得了显著进展，证明了自回归模型在图像编辑任务中的优势，为精确指令引导编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中用户通常需要查看多个输出样本（如4-8个），但传统独立采样方法会导致结果冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集；采用渐进式剪枝策略提高运行效率。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提升了组多样性和质量。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Method: 提出了CineScale推理范式，针对两种视频生成架构设计了专门的变体，能够支持高分辨率T2I、T2V、I2V和V2V合成。

Result: 实验验证了该范式在扩展图像和视频模型高分辨率生成能力方面的优越性，实现了无需微调的8K图像生成和最小LoRA微调的4K视频生成。

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了预训练模型在高分辨率生成中的高频信息增加和重复模式问题，显著提升了视觉生成质量。

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了实用路径

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges of symptom evolution complexity and
insufficient temporal dependency modeling in Parkinson's disease progression
prediction. It proposes a unified prediction framework that integrates
structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，通过分层混合架构搜索和自适应变异策略，有效解决文本分类中NAS搜索空间过大和冗余的问题，在Spider数据集上测试准确率提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间过大且冗余，导致强化学习模型无法有效导航搜索空间，扁平化架构搜索导致搜索空间混乱难以遍历。

Method: 引入分层架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用Q-learning自适应变异策略，根据先前迭代的性能反馈动态调整，实现完全概率化搜索空间探索。

Result: 在数据库ID预测任务中持续发现高性能架构，在Spider数据集上相比现有基线方法测试准确率提升8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间效率问题，显著提升了架构搜索的性能。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

Motivation: DPO虽然简单稳定但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要新的对齐算法来解决这些问题

Method: 引入梯度解耦（用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid）、稳定性改进（偏移约束+正则化）、可控拒绝抑制（梯度分离+可调系数）

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均表现出性能提升

Conclusion: LPO是一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，已公开源代码、模型和训练数据

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

TL;DR: LFM4Ads是一个面向广告推荐的全表征多粒度迁移框架，通过全面迁移用户表征、物品表征和交叉表征，并采用多粒度迁移机制，在腾讯工业级广告平台中实现了显著的商业效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅迁移用户表征，忽略了物品表征和用户-物品交叉表征的价值，且简单将用户表征作为下游应用特征，未能有效弥合上下游差距和利用更多迁移粒度。

Method: 提出LFM4Ads框架：1）全面迁移三种表征；2）识别最优提取层并将交叉表征聚合为可迁移的粗粒度形式；3）通过非线性适配器（特征级）、同构交互模块（模块级）和独立检索（模型级）实现多粒度迁移。

Result: 在腾讯工业级广告平台成功部署，处理每日数百亿样本，模型参数达TB级。自2024年Q4上线以来，在微信朋友圈和视频号等主要广告场景完成10+次成功上线，整体平台GMV提升2.45%，预计年收入增加数亿美元。

Conclusion: LFM4Ads通过全表征迁移和多粒度机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在工业规模广告推荐中实现了显著的业务提升，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to

time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高保真重建，支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Motivation: 神经算子在理论上需要大量参数才能解决算子学习问题，这与实验证据相矛盾。本文旨在弥合这一差距，特别是在解决凸优化问题家族时。

Method: 使用生成平衡算子(GEOs)和有限维深度平衡层，处理可分离希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题。输入是光滑凸损失函数，输出是对应的优化问题近似解。

Result: 当输入损失函数位于合适的无限维紧集中时，GEO可以以任意精度均匀逼近相应解，且秩、深度和宽度仅以逼近误差倒数的对数速度增长。在非线性PDE、随机最优控制和数学金融对冲问题三个应用中验证了理论结果和可训练性。

Conclusion: GEOs成功弥合了神经算子理论与实践的差距，证明了在适当条件下可以用对数级增长的参数复杂度有效解决无限维凸优化问题，为相关应用提供了理论保证和实用方法。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大型机器学习模型分布式分区中的复杂性问题，提供了高效、自动化的优化解决方案。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Motivation: 现有的图神经网络在分子属性预测方面表现出色，但其黑盒性质降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等重要应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，并通过减少片段间消息传递的模型架构来估计片段对模型输出的因果影响。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

TL;DR: Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot)是一种集成不确定性估计的优化方法，通过并行训练两个相同模型并定期重置均值，在深度学习中提供校准良好的不确定性估计和正则化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，这在过参数化和低数据场景中尤为严重。标准的bootstrap方法在深度学习中不实用，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程。

Method: 训练两个相同模型在独立的bootstrap样本上并行训练，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一basin内，利用它们的差异来估计局部不确定性，并在训练过程中使用这种估计进行自适应权重采样以实现正则化。

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性映射。

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功地将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，解决了传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中的局限性，为过参数化模型提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化手段。

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

TL;DR: 本文全面探索了层冻结技术中缓存特征图方法的挑战，提出了相似性感知额外扩增和渐进压缩策略，在保持模型准确性的同时显著降低训练成本和存储开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度神经网络和数据集规模的增长，训练计算成本显著增加。层冻结技术虽然能减少计算成本，但传统方法中冻结层仍需进行前向传播，限制了计算成本的降低。虽然缓存特征图方法看似简单，但存在重大挑战如特征图扩增和存储开销问题。

Method: 提出了两个核心技术：1) 相似性感知额外扩增（similarity-aware channel augmentation）：通过缓存具有高扩增敏感性的通道，以最小的存储成本提高训练准确性；2) 渐进压缩策略（progressive compression）：随着更多层的冻结，逐渐提高压缩比，有效降低存储开销。

Result: 该方案在保持模型准确性的同时，实现了训练成本的显著降低，且只带来较小的时间开销。同时进行了对冻结和压缩策略的全面评估，为高效DNN训练提供了优化应用的见解。

Conclusion: 该研究首次全面解决了层冻结技术中缓存特征图方法的关键挑战，通过创新的扩增和压缩方法，实现了计算成本和存储开销的双重优化，为大规模深度网络训练提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

### [176] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在异质污染率下的鲁棒估计问题，为多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布的均值估计提供了紧的极小极大率，并为多元高斯均值估计和线性回归建立了平方误差的极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习、众包和传感器网络等应用中，样本可能以已知但非相同的概率被独立污染，现有鲁棒估计器通常假设均匀或最坏情况污染，忽略了结构性异质性。

Method: 针对不同分布类型（多元有界分布、单变量高斯分布、多元高斯分布）和线性回归问题，分析异质污染模式下的最优估计策略，确定样本丢弃阈值。

Result: 获得了所有异质污染模式的紧极小极大率，发现最优估计器可能会丢弃超过特定污染阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的污染率经验分布决定。

Conclusion: 研究为异质污染环境下的鲁棒估计提供了理论基础，表明考虑污染率的结构性异质性对设计最优估计器至关重要，特别是在高维情况下（维度d的影响为√d因子）。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代优化算法对超参数（特别是步长）选择敏感，调参困难且耗时，需要提高优化器在不同超参数选择下的稳定性

Method: 提出基于动量的NGN步长方法（NGN-M），在较宽松假设下实现标准收敛率，无需插值条件或有界梯度假设

Result: NGN-M算法在保持与最先进优化器相当性能的同时，显著提高了对步长超参数选择的鲁棒性

Conclusion: NGN-M算法通过结合动量和NGN步长方法，有效解决了优化器对步长超参数敏感的问题，提供了更稳定的性能表现

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"欺骗性样本"现象，即网络对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类，旨在理解DNN泛化行为的理论基础。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免传统的基于梯度的优化和显式标签方法，研究过参数化状态下DNN的特征空间坍塌现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现特征空间坍塌，虽然改善泛化但增加层数会导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能够绕过退化并协调随机标签与有意义标签。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化机制提供了新视角，揭示了捷径学习的本质，并为无监督学习动态的未来研究指明了方向，有助于弥合理论与实践的差距。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在减少神经元多义性方面的效果，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，发现SAE能提高概念分离度但稀疏性不一定带来更好性能，并开发了新的干预方法APP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中神经元的多义性问题是可解释性的主要障碍，先前研究认为稀疏自编码器能促进单义性，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念可分离性评分，评估神经元激活分布在不同概念间的区分度，并开发了APP干预方法。

Result: SAE确实减少了多义性并实现了更高的概念可分离性，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的分离性，且经常损害下游性能。APP方法在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器能有效提高神经元的概念分离性，但需要平衡稀疏性与性能；新提出的APP干预方法能实现更精确的概念级控制，为模型可解释性和可控性提供了新工具。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，在约16亿参数设计范围内集成SSM骨干、稀疏全局注意力、分块MoE前馈路由和双记忆系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决长上下文语言模型在处理长序列时的效率和容量挑战，通过模块化设计结合多种先进技术来创建输入自适应的模型架构。

Method: 集成Mamba风格的SSM骨干网络，间歇性稀疏全局注意力，分块级MoE前馈路由，以及工作记忆和事实PKM的双记忆系统，采用分阶段课程学习策略。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra为模块化、输入自适应的长上下文语言模型提供了一个蓝图，结合了SSM效率、稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆，但最终任务性能验证仍需未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术被开发出来阻止生成特定目标概念。但现有CETs的有效性和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含层次化和组合式提示词，通过自动化评估流程从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄露。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词轻易绕过，存在属性泄露问题，并表现出注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重安全漏洞，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

TL;DR: 提出了一种源无关的机器学习遗忘方法，能够在不需要原始训练数据集的情况下，高效地从训练模型中移除特定数据，并保持剩余数据的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习普及和数据隐私法规发展，从训练模型中移除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要。现有遗忘方法通常需要访问完整训练数据集，但在实际场景中原始训练数据可能无法获取。

Method: 基于最近的研究工作，提出了一种方法能够估计未知剩余训练数据的Hessian矩阵，这是高效遗忘所需的关键组件。利用这种估计技术，实现了高效的零样本遗忘。

Result: 在广泛数据集上的大量实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够提供强大的理论保证，同时在保持剩余数据性能方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了源无关场景下的机器学习遗忘问题，为实际应用中无法获取原始训练数据的情况提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习缺乏统一的数学框架来处理各种动态系统模型。作者希望利用范畴论和余代数等抽象数学工具，为RL建立一个更通用、形式化的理论基础，特别是为了处理异步并行分布式计算场景。

Method: 1. 使用范畴和函子对RL进行建模，将MDP算法空间表示为函子范畴
2. 引入Bertsekas和Tsitsiklis的异步分布式最小化标准模型
3. 利用度量余归纳和异步收敛定理建立理论联系
4. 将各种动态系统(MDPs、POMDPs、PSRs、LDSs)统一为余代数特例
5. 将RL中的固定点求解问题推广为在并行分布式环境中异步确定最终余代数

Result: 建立了一个统一的范畴化RL框架，能够：
- 将传统RL模型统一表示为余代数
- 在拓扑斯范畴中处理所有(余)极限、子对象分类和指数对象
- 为异步并行分布式RL计算提供形式化基础

Conclusion: URL框架成功地将强化学习问题范畴化，通过余代数和拓扑斯理论提供了强大的数学抽象，为处理复杂异步分布式RL问题奠定了理论基础，扩展了传统RL的研究范围和方法论。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

TL;DR: SafeLLM是一个基于遗忘学习的防御框架，通过三阶段流程（动态检测、有害内容追踪、约束优化）来消除大语言模型中的有害知识，同时保持语言流畅性和通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过对齐机制，导致大语言模型产生有害内容，对模型安全构成严重威胁。

Method: 采用三阶段管道：1）使用外部分类器和模型内部评估的混合方法进行动态不安全输出检测；2）通过前馈网络激活进行词级有害内容追踪以定位有害知识；3）约束优化来抑制不安全行为而不降低整体模型质量。

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是构建可扩展和有效的大语言模型安全性的有前景方向，SafeLLM在消除有害知识后仍能保持通用性能。

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Conclusion: 频率自适应TNN算法在解决高维多尺度问题上表现出优异的有效性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted thorough
ablation analyses of SleepDIFFormer and interpreted the differential attention
weights, highlighting their relevance to characteristic sleep EEG patterns.
These findings have implications for advancing automated sleep stage
classification and its application to sleep quality assessment. Our source code
is publicly available at https://github.com/Ben1001409/SleepDIFFormer

Motivation: 传统方法只使用单一归因机制进行模型训练，忽略了其他归因视角中的补充信息，导致模型性能有限。

Method: 设计了包含归因知识聚合器(AKA)和主要目标预测器(PTP)的联合学习框架，并提出CAT训练策略来利用所有归因标签的卡尔积产生丰富的监督信号。

Result: 离线评估显示GAUC提升0.51%，在线实验实现投资回报率(ROI)增长2.6%。

Conclusion: MAL框架能够有效整合多种归因视角的信息，显著提升了CVR预测模型的性能和实际业务价值。

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

Conclusion: 基于局部最优性保证的框架能够以可扩展的方式合成高质量的帕累托最优解释，在准确性和可解释性之间取得良好平衡。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构，限制了模型性能。

Method: 采用多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正对，通过统计最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变特征。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集的多标签超类分类中，AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练轮次减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%。

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks

However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但之前提出的CSG指标在KG环境中尚未经过验证，需要系统评估其有效性。

Method: 在多关系链接预测背景下检验CSG指标，引入transformer嵌入的语义表示，并提出并基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1相关性弱或不一致。关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关，而图连通性指标与Hit@10正相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测设置中的稳定性和泛化预测能力不成立，需要更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

Conclusion: 通过算法集体行动，用户端可以有效地诱导公平性，为偏见缓解提供了新的可行途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized

yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在嵌入式设备上实现快速轻量级个性化的人体活动识别混合框架，通过少样本学习仅更新分类器层，在三个不同场景中实现了显著的精度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决穿戴式设备人体活动识别在新用户部署时的性能下降问题，主要由于用户引起的概念漂移，需要高效的个性化方法。

Method: 采用混合框架：先跨用户泛化，然后直接在设备上使用少样本学习快速适应个体用户，仅更新分类器层以减少计算和内存开销。

Result: 在RISC-V GAP9微控制器上实现，在RecGym、QVAR-Gesture和Ultrasound-Gesture三个场景中分别获得3.73%、17.38%和3.70%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 证明了在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展和用户感知的HAR系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Motivation: 现有的分布差异测量方法在处理数据流聚类时存在两大问题：无法处理所有形状的聚类，计算复杂度过高

Method: 设计了一种专门用于检测聚类重叠而非差异性的新测量方法，重点关注聚类之间的相交情况

Result: 新方法计算速度比现有方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类同时避免合并正交聚类

Conclusion: 该方法为数据流在线学习中的聚类合并提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影特性有效解决了机器遗忘中的根本限制，为模型安全提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 该研究为动态分子开关在神经形态计算中的应用提供了理论支持，并可能启发更多可精确求解的模型来模拟物理器件实现脑启发计算。

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过批量验证相似输入区域，显著提升了神经网络局部鲁棒性验证的效率和可扩展性

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

Motivation: 现有的基于检索的欧几里得嵌入方法无法有效捕捉分子相互作用的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中。

Method: 采用双曲表示学习框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，构建蛋白质引导的三塔架构来增强表示结构。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上虚拟筛选的早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%），在JACS数据集上亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为蛋白质-配体建模提供了强大的归纳偏置，在两个任务中都显示出显著优势，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: 通过优化伪任务中的公平性可以有效增强结构公平性，促进不同下游应用中的公平性泛化

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems over undirected networks.
Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is

computational efficiency by allowing agents to use stochastic gradients during

the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the
algorithm in the strongly convex setting. We corroborate our theoretical
results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a
classification task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且训练不稳定，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户隐私保护训练机制

Method: SPOF通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，每个用户的数据通过向多项式系数添加校准噪声来实现私有化，不需要在损失函数梯度中注入噪声

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，表现出更好的隐私-效用权衡

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中提供了更优越的隐私保护性能，具有更好的计算效率和鲁棒性，特别适合存在环境噪声的分布式学习场景

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 在合成和真实基准测试（包括复杂医学生物标志物估计）中，性能达到或超过RoPE及其他标准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在模型失配环境下提供了改进的可扩展性和适用性，实现了无需模拟访问的高效推理。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Conclusion: CoNTM成功解决了持续学习中不遗忘先前知识的问题，在主题建模任务中表现出色

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码和解码设计，实现了基于学习的节点属性重建，有效捕捉异常信息，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法来分析算法分类错误对关键科学问题的影响，包括兄弟姐妹对儿童语言经验的影响以及儿童产出与输入之间的关联。

Result: 研究发现分类错误会显著扭曲估计值，例如自动化标注低估了兄弟姐妹对成人输入的负面影响达20-80%，可能使其低于统计显著性阈值。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯校准方法可以有效恢复无偏的效应大小估计，但不能提供万无一失的解决方案。该问题和方法适用于任何涉及事件检测和分类且错误率非零的分类器。

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

### [218] [Correct-By-Construction: Certified Individual Fairness through Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15642)
*Ruihan Zhang,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的机器学习个体公平性训练框架，通过可证明公平的初始化和公平保持训练算法，在整个训练过程中提供形式化的个体公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习算法往往无法实现个体公平性，虽然已有方法在经验上有效但缺乏形式化保证，而验证技术既不能提供确定性结果也不能主动提升训练过程中的公平性。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：(1)可证明公平的初始化确保模型从公平状态开始；(2)使用随机响应机制的保护敏感属性方法，设计公平保持训练算法在整个学习过程中维持公平性。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，能够产生经验上公平且准确的模型，同时比基于认证训练的方法效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习训练过程提供了形式化的个体公平性保证，解决了现有方法缺乏理论保证和验证技术效率低下的问题。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AICMET是一个基于Transformer的混合效应模型，结合了机制性药代动力学先验和上下文贝叶斯推断，能够在稀疏采样下实现准确的剂量反应预测，并在零样本情况下适应新化合物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准药物治疗需要准确的剂量反应预测，但传统方法在稀疏采样条件下效果有限，且模型开发周期长。需要一种能够快速适应新化合物并量化患者间变异性的新方法。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的潜在变量框架，结合Ornstein-Uhlenbeck先验对药代动力学参数进行预训练。模型在数十万个合成药代动力学轨迹上进行预训练，推理时利用先前试验参与者的上下文信息生成后验预测。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，AICMET达到了最先进的预测准确性，能够准确量化患者间变异性，优于非线性混合效应基准和神经ODE变体。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的群体感知神经架构为定制药代动力学建模提供了新的替代方案，为实现真正群体感知的个性化给药方案开辟了道路。

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Result: 在仿真和案例数据集上表现优于多个基准方法，特别在高变异性子群体场景中效果显著

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了预测准确性，还通过揭示底层模式增强了模型的可解释性，为个性化建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放式多段灵环境来研究AI社会智能，而真实世界环境本质上是多段灵的并包含人类专家。社会智能可以加速AI代理的训练，学习适应性技能和行为。

Method: 设计了一个多段灵环境，多个自利代理可以追求复杂独立目标。研究社会学习对代理性能的影响，包括在专家存在下的学习和隐式合作行为。

Result: 环境能够支持研究社会智能AI代理的发展，包括合作对抗共同敌人、建设和共享工具、实现长期限目标等行为。

Conclusion: 该环境为研究开放式多段灵设置中的社会智能AI代理提供了平台，有助于探索代理如何通过合作或竞争获得改善。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

<details>

Motivation: 提升物理约束神经网络(PECANN)框架在求解偏微分方程(PDEs)时的能力，解决异质约束执行、内存效率、多尺度特征处理、长时间演化等挑战

Method: 1) 多惩罚参数ALM方法 2) 期望约束执行减少内存开销 3) 傅里叶特征映射处理多尺度特征 4) 时间窗口策略确保连续性 5) 条件自适应惩罚更新(CAPU)策略

Result: 在跨音速稀疏问题、涡旋被动平流、高波数Helmholtz和Poisson方程、热源反演识别等问题上表现出色，与现有方法和Kolmogorov-Arnold网络相比具有竞争力

Conclusion: PECANN-CAPU显著提高了框架的鲁棒性、效率和科学计算中苛刻问题的适用性

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了D-Wave量子逆灰器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能上的突出差异，尝试混合采样方法改善RBM训练，并首次展示了量子生成样本在减缓灾除遗忘中的应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释之前使用D-Wave采样在RBM训练中未能产生显著改善的原因，并探索如何利用量子逆灰器与经典方法的差异来改善机器学习性能。

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和量子逆灰器的采样贡献，并在灾除遗忘减缓中使用量子生成的样本进行生成式重现。

Result: 混合采样方法在RBM训练中未能实现改善，但首次证明了使用量子生成的样本进行灾除遗忘减缓的可行性，效果与经典方法相当。

Conclusion: 量子逆灰器与MCMC在分布低概率区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但在生成多样化低概率样本方面具有潜力，特别是在避免灾除遗忘等具有挑战性的机器学习应用中。

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种针对大语言模型训练的通信高效算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，实现高达1-3%稀疏度和2位量化的极端压缩比，在通信受限环境下超越全精度DiLoCo的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境（如跨数据中心）中仍存在通信瓶颈，即使减少通信频率也需要传输完整梯度副本，且性能略低于标准AdamW DDP基线。量化方法在大语言模型预训练中稀疏化应用有限。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似（通过误差反馈和激进稀疏化），并发现稀疏聚合能提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的大语言模型训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均表现出显著优势，压缩比达到1-3%稀疏度和2位量化。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo通过有效利用稀疏化和量化技术，成功解决了大语言模型分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，在极端压缩条件下仍能保持甚至提升模型性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI快速发展，安全仍是部署机器学习系统的主要瓶颈。OOD检测是关键安全组件，但之前的研究发现似然方法在实践中经常失败，作者希望探索这是否是像素空间的问题，还是表示空间也存在密度估计能力不足的问题。

Method: 训练变分扩散模型在预训练ResNet-18的表示空间上进行密度估计，而不是在图像像素空间上。使用OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 研究表明在表示空间中基于似然的OOD检测器性能得到验证，与最先进方法进行比较分析。

Conclusion: 通过将密度估计从像素空间转移到表示空间，可以改善基于似然的OOD检测性能，为解决实际部署中的安全问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and

training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

Conclusion: Alpha Berkeley框架为高风险领域的智能体系统提供了一个可靠且透明的解决方案，能够有效协调异构控制系统的工作流。

Abstract: Coordinating workflows across heterogeneous control systems remains a central
challenge in safety-critical environments such as scientific facilities,
industrial plants, and energy infrastructures. Language-model-driven agents
offer a natural interface for these tasks, but existing approaches often lack
scalability, reliability, and human oversight. We introduce the Alpha Berkeley
Framework, a production-ready architecture for scalable agentic systems that
integrate conversational context with robust tool orchestration. The framework
features dynamic capability classification to select only relevant tools per
task, a plan-first orchestration model that generates execution plans with
explicit dependencies and optional human approval, context-aware task
extraction that combines dialogue history with external memory and domain
resources, and production-ready execution environments with checkpointing,
artifact management, and modular deployment. We demonstrate its versatility
through two case studies: a tutorial-style wind farm monitoring example and a
deployment at the Advanced Light Source particle accelerator. These results
establish Alpha Berkeley as a reliable and transparent framework for agentic
systems in high-stakes domains.

*Ruiyu Zhang,Lin Nie,Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: HEAS是一个Python框架，将分层代理建模与进化优化和锦标赛评估统一在单一可重复工作流中，通过轻量级进程层次结构和确定性调度实现跨尺度耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多尺度代理建模中跨尺度耦合不明确、评估标准不统一、可重复性差的问题，提供一个统一的框架来整合仿真、优化和评估功能。

Method: 使用分层轻量级进程（"streams"）在确定性层中调度，共享上下文读写，提供紧凑API和CLI支持单/多目标进化、PyTorch策略集成和自定义锦标赛工具。

Result: 框架实现了机制与编排的分离，支持外生驱动、内生代理和聚合器的组合交换，提供统一的每步和回合评估指标，减少了胶水代码并提高了研究可比性。

Conclusion: HEAS为跨学科、多层级研究提供了实用基础，能够产生可靠且可重复的结果，通过两个紧凑示例展示了其生态和企业决策场景的应用价值。

Abstract: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that
unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and
tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents
models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in
deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale
couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize,
evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy
integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament
tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes
evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,
logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,
Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving
comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from
orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators
to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be
used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We
illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an
enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for
cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible
results.

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉叙事（如漫画）需要结构化表示来捕捉事件、角色及其关系，但符号叙事图谱存在不一致性和冗余问题，限制了推理和泛化的有效性。

Method: 基于认知基础的叙事理解模型，使用词汇相似性和嵌入聚类方法来整合语义相关的动作和事件，对面板级、事件级和故事级图谱进行规范化处理。

Result: 在Manga109数据集上的初步评估显示，语义规范化在动作检索、角色定位和事件摘要等叙事推理任务中提高了连贯性和鲁棒性，同时保持了符号透明度。

Conclusion: 语义规范化是构建可扩展、认知启发的多模态叙事理解图谱模型的关键步骤，能够有效提升叙事知识图谱的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

TL;DR: Holo-Artisan是一个创新的虚拟博物馆系统，通过全息显示和边缘智能技术实现多用户沉浸式体验，让数字艺术品能够实时个性化响应每位观众。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博物馆展览是静态的，缺乏与观众的互动性。作者希望创造一种能够让数字艺术品与每位观众进行个性化实时互动的沉浸式体验，提升文化遗产的互动方式。

Method: 采用边缘计算节点处理实时用户数据（姿态、表情、语音），生成式AI驱动数字艺术品响应，云端协作平台使用通用场景描述合成共享场景，结合光线追踪渲染技术，并集成联邦学习保护隐私。

Result: 系统能够实现多用户同时体验，数字艺术品（如蒙娜丽莎）可以同时对不同观众做出个性化反应（如微笑或语音问答），在保持低延迟的同时确保共享体验的同步性。

Conclusion: Holo-Artisan将静态博物馆展品转变为动态的、有生命的艺术品，开创了文化遗产互动的新范式，通过边缘智能和全息技术实现了真正的个性化沉浸式体验。

Abstract: We present Holo-Artisan, a novel system architecture enabling immersive
multi-user experiences in virtual museums through true holographic displays and
personalized edge intelligence. In our design, local edge computing nodes
process real-time user data -- including pose, facial expression, and voice --
for multiple visitors concurrently. Generative AI models then drive digital
artworks (e.g., a volumetric Mona Lisa) to respond uniquely to each viewer. For
instance, the Mona Lisa can return a smile to one visitor while engaging in a
spoken Q\&A with another, all in real time. A cloud-assisted collaboration
platform composes these interactions in a shared scene using a universal scene
description, and employs ray tracing to render high-fidelity, personalized
views with a direct pipeline to glasses-free holographic displays. To preserve
user privacy and continuously improve personalization, we integrate federated
learning (FL) -- edge devices locally fine-tune AI models and share only model
updates for aggregation. This edge-centric approach minimizes latency and
bandwidth usage, ensuring a synchronized shared experience with individual
customization. Through Holo-Artisan, static museum exhibits are transformed
into dynamic, living artworks that engage each visitor in a personal dialogue,
heralding a new paradigm of cultural heritage interaction.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and
compressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\Delta}ER representation
to address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the
\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes
and applications in-the-loop. The MIT-licensed software is available from a

Abstract: Various real-time methods for capturing and transmitting dynamic 3D spaces
have been proposed, including those based on RGB-D cameras and volumetric
capture. However, applying existing methods to outdoor tourist sites remains
difficult because maintenance and aesthetic constraints limit sensor placement,
and daylight variability complicates processing. We propose a system that
combines multiple LiDARs and cameras for live dynamic point cloud capture, and
integrates them with pre-captured static point clouds for wide-area 3D
visualization. The system sustains 30 fps across wide-area scenes while keeping
latency below 100 ms. To mitigate lighting inconsistencies, static point-cloud
colors are automatically adjusted to current lighting. The effectiveness of our
system is demonstrated through real-world deployment in a tourist site.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单帧最终状态评估方法在连续动态无人机操作中的不足，将大型语言模型的通用推理能力与无人机严格物理执行约束相结合。

Method: 采用连续状态评估方法进行鲁棒准确的任务结果判定，并结合分层行为树修改模型，通过多级BT计划分析和约束策略空间实现结构化反思学习。

Result: 实验结果显示SRDrone相比基线方法成功率提升44.87%，通过迭代自我精化优化的经验库在实际部署中达到96.25%的成功率。

Conclusion: SRDrone成功将自适应任务精化能力嵌入工业级行为树规划框架，有效整合了大型语言模型的推理智能与无人机物理执行约束。

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

TL;DR: Kitchen-R是一个新颖的厨房环境基准测试，统一评估任务规划和低级控制，填补了机器人学和具身AI研究中高层语言指令跟随与低级执行之间的评估空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在显著差距：高层语言指令跟随基准假设完美低级执行，而低级控制基准依赖简单单步命令，缺乏对任务规划和物理执行都关键的综合系统评估。

Method: 使用Isaac Sim模拟器构建数字孪生厨房环境，包含500多个复杂语言指令，支持移动机械臂机器人。提供基于视觉语言模型的任务规划策略和基于扩散策略的低级控制策略基线方法。

Result: 开发了一个灵活的评估框架，支持三种评估模式：规划模块独立评估、控制策略独立评估以及关键的系统集成评估。

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究的关键空白，使语言引导机器人代理的基准测试更加全面和现实。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型灵巧操作策略经常出现空闲现象（停止移动），这反映了训练数据的局限性，特别是在需要高精度动作的区域。现有方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能对策略性能产生负面影响

Method: PIP方法检测策略空闲状态，并在这些状态下施加扰动，帮助策略逃离问题吸引域。该方法无需额外监督或训练，通过利用空闲行为的可检测性来指导探索和策略改进

Result: 在模拟双臂任务中显著提升测试性能，实际插入任务中实现15-35%的绝对成功率提升。学习由此产生的episodes还能带来比先前方法更好的迭代策略改进

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的扰动策略，能够显著改善灵巧操作策略的鲁棒性和性能，特别是在需要高精度操作的关键运动点上

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种动态耦合信息的轨迹优化算法，用于自由浮动空间操纵器系统，利用动态耦合来改善轨迹规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过往研究主要关注如何最小化基座与操纵手臂之间的动态耦合，而忽视了其潜在优势。本文研究如何利用动态耦合来改善轨迹规划。

Method: 采用动态耦合矩阵的奇异值分解(SVD)来识别主导的耦合行为组件，形成量化指标来定量评估耦合强度和方向性，并将其整合到轨迹优化框架中。设计滑模控制跟踪控制器来评估优化轨迹的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的动态耦合信息轨迹优化算法成功利用了动态耦合的潜在优势，而非传统地屏蔽它，为空间操纵器系统的控制开启了新的研究思路。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Conclusion: NeRD为机器人动力学模拟提供了一种通用、可泛化的神经解决方案，能够有效处理复杂接触约束，并具备从真实数据学习的能力，有望弥合模拟与现实的鸿沟

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

Motivation: 军事车辆移动时产生的噪声会降低枪声检测系统的性能，需要开发计算资源需求低的降噪算法

Method: 采用两层隐藏层感知器神经网络结合信号处理技术，而非重型卷积神经网络，以实现轻量化设计

Result: 在噪声RMS值与枪口冲击波峰值幅度相当时，检测率提高了一倍以上

Conclusion: 轻量级神经网络结合信号处理能有效提升移动军事环境中枪声检测系统的性能

Abstract: Acoem develops gunshot detection systems, consisting of a microphone array
and software that detects and locates shooters on the battlefield. The
performance of such systems is obviously affected by the acoustic environment
in which they are operating: in particular, when mounted on a moving military
vehicle, the presence of noise reduces the detection performance of the
software. To limit the influence of the acoustic environment, a neural network
has been developed. Instead of using a heavy convolutional neural network, a
lightweight neural network architecture was chosen to limit the computational
resources required to embed the algorithm on as many hardware platforms as
possible. Thanks to the combination of a two hidden layer perceptron and
appropriate signal processing techniques, the detection rate of impulsive
muzzle blast waveforms (the wave coming from the detonation and indicating the
position of the shooter) is significantly increased. With a rms value of noise
of the same order as the muzzle blast peak amplitude, the detect rate is more
than doubled with this denoising processing.

Conclusion: Dirichlet分布为动态情感序列建模提供了有效框架，结合人类反馈的多阶段方法能够显著提升3D虚拟角色动画的情感表现真实性，为动态语音情感识别开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This work proposes to explore a new area of dynamic speech emotion
recognition. Unlike traditional methods, we assume that each audio track is
associated with a sequence of emotions active at different moments in time. The
study particularly focuses on the animation of emotional 3D avatars. We propose
a multi-stage method that includes the training of a classical speech emotion
recognition model, synthetic generation of emotional sequences, and further
model improvement based on human feedback. Additionally, we introduce a novel
approach to modeling emotional mixtures based on the Dirichlet distribution.
The models are evaluated based on ground-truth emotions extracted from a
dataset of 3D facial animations. We compare our models against the sliding
window approach. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of
Dirichlet-based approach in modeling emotional mixtures. Incorporating human
feedback further improves the model quality while providing a simplified
annotation procedure.

Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven
methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for
respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant
spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by
these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups,
particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable
in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of
significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed
approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the
potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and
improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more
interpretable results.

Abstract: Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims at identifying anomalous sounds from
machines and has gained extensive research interests from both academia and
industry. However, the uncertainty of anomaly location and much redundant
information such as noise in machine sounds hinder the improvement of ASD
system performance. This paper proposes a novel audio feature of filter banks
with evenly distributed intervals, ensuring equal attention to all frequency
ranges in the audio, which enhances the detection of anomalies in machine
sounds. Moreover, based on pre-trained models, this paper presents a
parameter-free feature enhancement approach to remove redundant information in
machine audio. It is believed that this parameter-free strategy facilitates the
effective transfer of universal knowledge from pre-trained tasks to the ASD
task during model fine-tuning. Evaluation results on the Detection and
Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) 2024 Challenge dataset

Abstract: AudioSet is a widely used benchmark in the audio research community and has
significantly advanced various audio-related tasks. However, persistent issues
with label accuracy and completeness remain critical bottlenecks that limit
performance in downstream applications.To address the aforementioned
challenges, we propose a three-stage reannotation framework that harnesses
general-purpose audio-language foundation models to systematically improve the
label quality of AudioSet. The framework employs a cross-modal prompting
strategy, inspired by the concept of prompt chaining, wherein prompts are
sequentially composed to execute subtasks (audio comprehension, label
synthesis, and semantic alignment). Leveraging this framework, we construct a
high-quality, structured relabeled version of AudioSet-R. Extensive experiments
conducted on representative audio classification models--including AST, PANNs,
SSAST, and AudioMAE--consistently demonstrate substantial performance
improvements, thereby validating the generalizability and effectiveness of the
proposed approach in enhancing label reliability.The code is publicly available

<details>

Motivation: 现有音频生成模型水印方法仅支持模型级溯源，无法追踪底层训练数据集，这在版权和问责场景中存在重大局限性。需要开发能够同时溯源模型和数据来源的双重水印技术。

Method: 提出Dual Watermark Embedding (DWE)模块在梅尔频谱表示中嵌入双重水印，配合Watermark Consistency Loss (WCL)确保从生成音频中可靠提取两个水印。建立首个双溯源基准DAB进行评估。

Result: DualMark达到出色的溯源准确率（模型溯源97.01% F1分数，数据集溯源91.51% AUC），在激进剪枝、有损压缩、加性噪声和采样攻击等条件下保持卓越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为实现完全可问责的音频生成模型提供了基础性步骤，显著增强了版权保护和责任追踪能力。

Abstract: Existing watermarking methods for audio generative models only enable
model-level attribution, allowing the identification of the originating
generation model, but are unable to trace the underlying training dataset. This
significant limitation raises critical provenance questions, particularly in
scenarios involving copyright and accountability concerns. To bridge this
fundamental gap, we introduce DualMark, the first dual-provenance watermarking
framework capable of simultaneously encoding two distinct attribution
signatures, i.e., model identity and dataset origin, into audio generative
models during training. Specifically, we propose a novel Dual Watermark
Embedding (DWE) module to seamlessly embed dual watermarks into Mel-spectrogram
representations, accompanied by a carefully designed Watermark Consistency Loss
(WCL), which ensures reliable extraction of both watermarks from generated
audio signals. Moreover, we establish the Dual Attribution Benchmark (DAB), the
first robustness evaluation benchmark specifically tailored for joint
model-data attribution. Extensive experiments validate that DualMark achieves
outstanding attribution accuracy (97.01% F1-score for model attribution, and
91.51% AUC for dataset attribution), while maintaining exceptional robustness
against aggressive pruning, lossy compression, additive noise, and sampling
attacks, conditions that severely compromise prior methods. Our work thus
provides a foundational step toward fully accountable audio generative models,
significantly enhancing copyright protection and responsibility tracing
capabilities.

Abstract: Speaker attribute perturbation offers a feasible approach to asynchronous
voice anonymization by employing adversarially perturbed speech as anonymized
output. In order to enhance the identity unlinkability among anonymized
utterances from the same original speaker, the targeted attack training
strategy is usually applied to anonymize the utterances to a common designated
speaker. However, this strategy may violate the privacy of the designated
speaker who is an actual speaker. To mitigate this risk, this paper proposes an
any-to-any training strategy. It is accomplished by defining a batch mean loss
to anonymize the utterances from various speakers within a training mini-batch
to a common pseudo-speaker, which is approximated as the average speaker in the
mini-batch. Based on this, a speaker-adversarial speech generation model is
proposed, incorporating the supervision from both the untargeted attack and the
any-to-any strategies. The speaker attribute perturbations are generated and
incorporated into the original speech to produce its anonymized version. The
effectiveness of the proposed model was justified in asynchronous voice
anonymization through experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets.
Additional experiments were carried out to explore the potential limitations of
speaker-adversarial speech in voice privacy protection. With them, we aim to
provide insights for future research on its protective efficacy against
black-box speaker extractors \textcolor{black}{and adaptive attacks, as well
as} generalization to out-of-domain datasets \textcolor{black}{and stability}.

Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) is a fundamental problem in computational
audition, which seeks to classify environments based on the distinctive
acoustic features. In the ASC task of the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge, the
organizers introduce a multimodal ASC task. Unlike traditional ASC systems that
rely solely on audio inputs, this challenge provides additional textual
information as inputs, including the location where the audio is recorded and
the time of recording. In this paper, we present our proposed system for the
ASC task in the APSIPA ASC 2025 Grand Challenge. Specifically, we propose a
multimodal network, \textbf{ASCMamba}, which integrates audio and textual
information for fine-grained acoustic scene understanding and effective
multimodal ASC. The proposed ASCMamba employs a DenseEncoder to extract
hierarchical spectral features from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba

### [258] [Kernel-based Equalized Odds: A Quantification of Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off in Fair Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15084)

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel kernel-based formulation of the Equalized Odds
(EO) criterion, denoted as $EO_k$, for fair representation learning (FRL) in
supervised settings. The central goal of FRL is to mitigate discrimination
regarding a sensitive attribute $S$ while preserving prediction accuracy for
the target variable $Y$. Our proposed criterion enables a rigorous and
interpretable quantification of three core fairness objectives: independence
(prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent of $S$), separation (also known as
equalized odds; prediction $\hat{Y}$ is independent with $S$ conditioned on
target attribute $Y$), and calibration ($Y$ is independent of $S$ conditioned
on the prediction $\hat{Y}$). Under both unbiased ($Y$ is independent of $S$)
and biased ($Y$ depends on $S$) conditions, we show that $EO_k$ satisfies both
independence and separation in the former, and uniquely preserves predictive
accuracy while lower bounding independence and calibration in the latter,
thereby offering a unified analytical characterization of the tradeoffs among
these fairness criteria. We further define the empirical counterpart,
$\hat{EO}_k$, a kernel-based statistic that can be computed in quadratic time,
with linear-time approximations also available. A concentration inequality for
$\hat{EO}_k$ is derived, providing performance guarantees and error bounds,
which serve as practical certificates of fairness compliance. While our focus
is on theoretical development, the results lay essential groundwork for
principled and provably fair algorithmic design in future empirical studies.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的系统辨识工具，能够融合数据信息与多种先验知识，同时支持在线和离线贝叶斯推理与学习，无需用户定制的坐标变换或模型反演。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在从有限数据学习动态系统模型时，如何融合不同的先验知识（如部分已知系统方程和未知模型部分的平滑性假设）与数据信息仍然是一个挑战，特别是在具有潜在系统状态的输入-输出设置中。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的接口，将已知动态函数与基于学习的未知系统部分近似相结合。基于提出的模型结构，推导了用于高效参数边缘化的闭式密度。

Result: 开发了一个通用工具，首次为在线和离线贝叶斯推理与学习提供一致解决方案，同时允许融入显式和隐式先验系统知识。

Conclusion: 所设计的框架具有广泛的适用性，在三个不同的案例研究中得到验证，包括一个实验数据集，证明了其作为推理和学习通用工具的实用性。

Abstract: Accuracy and generalization capabilities are key objectives when learning
dynamical system models. To obtain such models from limited data, current works
exploit prior knowledge and assumptions about the system. However, the fusion
of diverse prior knowledge, e. g. partially known system equations and
smoothness assumptions about unknown model parts, with information contained in
the data remains a challenging problem, especially in input-output settings
with latent system state. In particular, learning functions that are nested
inside known system equations can be a laborious and error-prone expert task.
This paper considers inference of latent states and learning of unknown model
parts for fusion of data information with different sources of prior knowledge.
The main contribution is a general-purpose system identification tool that, for
the first time, provides a consistent solution for both, online and offline
Bayesian inference and learning while allowing to incorporate explicit and
implicit prior system knowledge. We propose a novel interface for combining
known dynamics functions with a learning-based approximation of unknown system
parts. Based on the proposed model structure, closed-form densities for
efficient parameter marginalization are derived. No user-tailored coordinate
transformations or model inversions are needed, making the presented framework
a general-purpose tool for inference and learning. The broad applicability of
the devised framework is illustrated in three distinct case studies, including
an experimental data set.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文首次提供了噪声高斯过程预期改善（GP-EI）算法的累积悔憾上界分析，证明其在SE和Matérn核下是无悔憾算法，为实践中的主要倾向选择提供理论指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预期改善（EI）是贝叶斯优化中应用最广泛的获取函数之一，尽管在实践中成功应用，但其累积悔憾上界一直是个开放问题。需要理论分析来验证GP-EI在噪声环境下的性能保证。

Method: 分析了经典的噪声高斯过程预期改善（GP-EI）算法，考虑三种常用的主要倾向选择：最佳后验均值主要倾向（BPMI）、最佳采样后验均值主要倾向（BSPMI）和最佳观测主要倾向（BOI）。在贝叶斯设置下，对象函数是高斯过程的样本。

Result: 首次提供了GP-EI在BPMI和BSPMI主要倾向下的累积悔憾上界，证明在两种情况下GP-EI都是无悔憾算法（时间复杂度为O(1)），适用于平方指数（SE）和Matérn核。同时首次证明GP-EI使用BOI主要倾向时，要么达到次线性累积悔憾上界，要么具有快速收敛的噪声简单悔憾上界。

Conclusion: 研究结果为实践者在噪声环境下应用GP-EI时选择合适的主要倾向提供了理论指导。数值实验验证了这些发现。

Abstract: Expected improvement (EI) is one of the most widely used acquisition
functions in Bayesian optimization (BO). Despite its proven empirical success
in applications, the cumulative regret upper bound of EI remains an open
question. In this paper, we analyze the classic noisy Gaussian process expected
improvement (GP-EI) algorithm. We consider the Bayesian setting, where the
objective is a sample from a GP. Three commonly used incumbents, namely the
best posterior mean incumbent (BPMI), the best sampled posterior mean incumbent
(BSPMI), and the best observation incumbent (BOI) are considered as the choices
of the current best value in GP-EI. We present for the first time the
cumulative regret upper bounds of GP-EI with BPMI and BSPMI. Importantly, we
show that in both cases, GP-EI is a no-regret algorithm for both squared
exponential (SE) and Mat\'ern kernels. Further, we present for the first time
that GP-EI with BOI either achieves a sublinear cumulative regret upper bound
or has a fast converging noisy simple regret bound for SE and Mat\'ern kernels.
Our results provide theoretical guidance to the choice of incumbent when
practitioners apply GP-EI in the noisy setting. Numerical experiments are
conducted to validate our findings.

Conclusion: PIN架构成功解决了表格数据特征交互建模的挑战，在保持高预测性能的同时提供内在可解释性，为保险定价等应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modeling feature interactions in tabular data remains a key challenge in
predictive modeling, for example, as used for insurance pricing. This paper
proposes the Tree-like Pairwise Interaction Network (PIN), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly captures pairwise feature interactions
through a shared feed-forward neural network architecture that mimics the
structure of decision trees. PIN enables intrinsic interpretability by design,
allowing for direct inspection of interaction effects. Moreover, it allows for
efficient SHapley's Additive exPlanation (SHAP) computations because it only
involves pairwise interactions. We highlight connections between PIN and
established models such as GA2Ms, gradient boosting machines, and graph neural
networks. Empirical results on the popular French motor insurance dataset show
that PIN outperforms both traditional and modern neural networks benchmarks in
predictive accuracy, while also providing insight into how features interact
with each another and how they contribute to the predictions.

TL;DR: GEN2是一个生成式预测-校正框架，用于高效准确地预测极端事件统计。它结合条件高斯模拟器和非高斯机器学习校正步骤，能够在不同气候情景下准确预测极端事件统计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地球系统模型在生成大量气候实现以量化极端气候风险时计算成本高昂，需要开发更高效准确的方法来预测极端事件统计。

Method: 采用预测-校正框架：预测步骤使用条件高斯模拟器，校正步骤使用非高斯机器学习模型。ML模型在参考数据和向参考数据逼近的模拟场对上进行训练，确保对混沌的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型在历史ERA5数据上验证准确，并在各种未来气候变化情景中展示外推能力。仅使用单一变暖情景的一个实现进行训练，就能准确预测不同情景下的极端事件统计。

Conclusion: GEN2框架能够成功外推到训练数据分布之外，为高效准确的气候极端事件预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the increased risks of climate extremes requires
generating large ensembles of climate realization across a wide range of
emissions scenarios, which is computationally challenging for conventional
Earth System Models. We propose GEN2, a generative prediction-correction
framework for an efficient and accurate forecast of the extreme event
statistics. The prediction step is constructed as a conditional Gaussian
emulator, followed by a non-Gaussian machine-learning (ML) correction step. The
ML model is trained on pairs of the reference data and the emulated fields
nudged towards the reference, to ensure the training is robust to chaos. We
first validate the accuracy of our model on historical ERA5 data and then
demonstrate the extrapolation capabilities on various future climate change
scenarios. When trained on a single realization of one warming scenario, our
model accurately predicts the statistics of extreme events in different
scenarios, successfully extrapolating beyond the distribution of training data.

Conclusion: 离散虚拟完整约束为欠驱动脉冲控制系统提供了一种有效的轨道稳定方法，成功解决了魔鬼棒螺旋桨运动的控制问题，为类似机器人杂耍系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The control problem of realizing propeller motion of a devil-stick in the
vertical plane using impulsive forces applied normal to the stick is
considered. This problem is an example of underactuated robotic juggling and
has not been considered in the literature before. Inspired by virtual holonomic
constraints, the concept of discrete virtual holonomic constraints (DVHC) is
introduced for the first time to solve this orbital stabilization problem. At
the discrete instants when impulsive inputs are applied, the location of the
center-of-mass of the devil-stick is specified in terms of its orientation
angle. This yields the discrete zero dynamics (DZD), which provides conditions
for stable propeller motion. In the limiting case, when the rotation angle
between successive applications of impulsive inputs is chosen to be arbitrarily
small, the problem reduces to that of propeller motion under continuous
forcing. A controller that enforces the DVHC, and an orbit stabilizing
controller based on the impulse controlled Poincar\'e map approach are
presented. The efficacy of the approach to trajectory design and stabilization
is validated through simulations.

Result: 数值实验证实，使用与格林函数对应的正半定核函数能显著提高SVM模型在物理系统中的预测准确性。

Conclusion: SVM核函数与量子格林函数之间存在深刻的数学等价性，这种对应关系为设计更有效的核函数提供了新途径，特别是在物理系统应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We establish a mathematical equivalence between Support Vector Machine (SVM)
kernel functions and quantum propagators represented by time-dependent Green's
functions, which has remained largely unexplored.
  We demonstrate that many common SVM kernels correspond naturally to Green's
functions via operator inversion theory. The sigmoid kernel does not always
satisfy Mercer's theorem, and therefore the corresponding Green's function may
also fail to perform optimally.
  We further introduce a Kernel Polynomial Method (KPM) for designing
customized kernels that align with Green's functions.
  Our numerical experiments confirm that employing positive-semidefinite
kernels that correspond to Green's functions significantly improves predictive
accuracy of SVM models in physical systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed
quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing
quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms
face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these
challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir
computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a
reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling
capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical
phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to
the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel
advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and
experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal
simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size
and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first
experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image
classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the
correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and
quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for
quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in
the NISQ era.

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.

Abstract: Sea ice is governed by highly complex, scale-invariant, and anisotropic
processes that are challenging to represent in Earth system models. While
advanced numerical models have improved our understanding of the sea-ice
dynamics, their computational costs often limit their application in ensemble
forecasting and climate simulations. Here, we introduce GenSIM, the first
generative AI-based pan-Arctic model that predicts the evolution of all
relevant key properties, including concentration, thickness, and drift, in a
12-hour window with improved accuracy over deterministic predictions and high
computational efficiency, while remaining physically consistent. Trained on a
long simulation from a state-of-the-art sea-ice--ocean system, GenSIM robustly
reproduces statistics as observed in numerical models and observations,
exhibiting brittle-like short-term dynamics while also depicting the long-term
sea-ice decline. Driven solely by atmospheric forcings, we attribute GenSIM's
emergent extrapolation capabilities to patterns that reflect the long-term
impact of the ocean: it seemingly has learned an internal ocean emulator. This
ability to infer slowly evolving climate-relevant dynamics from short-term
predictions underlines the large potential of generative models to generalise
for unseen climates and to encode hidden physics.

Motivation: 随着AI模型在天气预报领域的快速发展，需要评估其在极端天气事件预测方面的可靠性和外推能力，特别是对于破纪录的极端天气事件。

Method: 通过比较HRES数值模型与GraphCast、Pangu-Weather、Fuxi等先进AI模型在破纪录高温、低温和大风事件中的预测表现，分析预报误差和偏差模式。

Result: AI模型在破纪录极端事件中的预报误差显著大于HRES模型，倾向于低估事件频率和强度，对热记录预测不足而对冷记录过度预测，且误差随记录超出程度增加而增大。

Conclusion: 当前AI天气模型在训练域外推和预测最具影响力的破纪录天气事件方面存在局限性，需要进一步严格验证和模型开发才能用于高风险应用。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models are revolutionizing weather
forecasting and have surpassed leading numerical weather prediction systems on
various benchmark tasks. However, their ability to extrapolate and reliably
forecast unprecedented extreme events remains unclear. Here, we show that for
record-breaking weather extremes, the numerical model High RESolution forecast
(HRES) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts still
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AI models GraphCast, GraphCast
operational, Pangu-Weather, Pangu-Weather operational, and Fuxi. We demonstrate
that forecast errors in AI models are consistently larger for record-breaking
heat, cold, and wind than in HRES across nearly all lead times. We further find
that the examined AI models tend to underestimate both the frequency and
intensity of record-breaking events, and they underpredict hot records and
overestimate cold records with growing errors for larger record exceedance. Our
findings underscore the current limitations of AI weather models in
extrapolating beyond their training domain and in forecasting the potentially
most impactful record-breaking weather events that are particularly frequent in
a rapidly warming climate. Further rigorous verification and model development
is needed before these models can be solely relied upon for high-stakes
applications such as early warning systems and disaster management.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying

whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for

Motivation: 现有的LM-based TTS系统容易产生偏离输入文本的幻觉语音，而现有的缓解策略要么需要大量训练资源，要么会显著增加推理延迟。

Method: 首先进行不确定性分析，发现幻觉与模型不确定性呈正相关；然后将TTS生成重新表述为轨迹流优化问题，引入增强的子轨迹平衡目标和锐化的内部奖励作为目标分布；还集成了奖励温度衰减和学习率优化来平衡稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: GOAT展示了强大的泛化能力和有效性，能够有效缓解LM-based TTS系统的幻觉问题，且不依赖大量资源或增加推理成本。

Abstract: Language Model (LM)-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems often generate
hallucinated speech that deviates from input text. Existing mitigation
strategies either demand excessive training resources or introduce significant
inference latency. In this paper, we propose GFlOwNet-guided distribution
AlignmenT (GOAT) for LM-based TTS, a post-training framework that mitigates
hallucinations without relying on massive resources or inference cost.
Specifically, we first conduct an uncertainty analysis, revealing a strong
positive correlation between hallucination and model uncertainty. Based on
this, we reformulate TTS generation as a trajectory flow optimization problem
and introduce an enhanced Subtrajectory Balance objective together with a
sharpened internal reward as target distribution. We further integrate reward
temperature decay and learning rate optimization for stability and performance
balance. Extensive experiments show that GOAT reduce over 50% character error
rates on challenging test cases and lowering uncertainty by up to 58%,
demonstrating its strong generalization ability and effectiveness.

three key components: 1) a frozen Whisper-large-v3 based speech encoder,
leveraging large-scale pretraining to ensure robust acoustic feature
extraction; 2) a trainable adaptor module using Linear-ReLU-Linear
transformation mechanisms to effectively align speech and text representations;
and 3) a frozen Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct large language model (LLM) integrated with
trainable LoRA for optimized contextual linguistic decoding. By systematically
combining pretrained models with task specific fine-tuning, the system achieved
a word/character error rate (WER/CER) of 9.83% across 11 languages in the

Abstract: Tongue imaging serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, particularly in
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The quality of tongue surface segmentation
significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and
subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing
research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a
lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a
tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge
distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation
method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while
reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by
96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an
impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged
and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool
(available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers
to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on
TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental
results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher
classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue
images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available
tongue image segmentation tool.

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的无监督3D CT超分辨率框架，利用模态扩散生成2D X光投影作为外部先验知识，通过3D高斯拷某和负值混合技术来重建高分辨率3D CT体积数据。

Conclusion: 综合扩散模型生成的外部先验知识和3D重建技术，为无监督3D CT超分辨率提供了有效解决方案，能够在不依赖成对数据的情况下恢复细微解剖结构。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于GAN的超分辨率方法在4D Flow MRI中的应用，特别是针对近壁血流速度恢复问题，发现Wasserstein GAN在稳定性和性能方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D Flow MRI在临床应用中受到空间分辨率低和噪声的限制，特别是在近壁血流速度测量方面。虽然机器学习超分辨率方法有潜力，但近壁速度恢复仍具挑战性。GAN在非医学超分辨率任务中表现出色，但在4D Flow MRI中的应用尚未探索。

Method: 使用患者特异性脑血管计算机模型生成合成图像，通过MR真实重建管道。实现专用GAN架构，评估三种对抗损失函数：Vanilla、Relativistic和Wasserstein GAN，并与非对抗性参考方法进行比较。

Result: 提出的GAN方法相比非对抗性参考改善了近壁速度恢复（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%）。Wasserstein GAN表现出最佳稳定性和增量改进（vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%），在低信噪比条件下也优于基线方法（vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%）。

Conclusion: GAN基超分辨率方法在增强4D Flow MRI方面具有潜力，特别是在具有挑战性的脑血管区域。Wasserstein GAN是最佳选择，但需要仔细选择对抗策略以确保训练稳定性。

Abstract: 4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) enables non-invasive
quantification of blood flow and hemodynamic parameters. However, its clinical
application is limited by low spatial resolution and noise, particularly
affecting near-wall velocity measurements. Machine learning-based
super-resolution has shown promise in addressing these limitations, but
challenges remain, not least in recovering near-wall velocities. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) offer a compelling solution, having demonstrated
strong capabilities in restoring sharp boundaries in non-medical
super-resolution tasks. Yet, their application in 4D Flow MRI remains
unexplored, with implementation challenged by known issues such as training
instability and non-convergence. In this study, we investigate GAN-based
super-resolution in 4D Flow MRI. Training and validation were conducted using
patient-specific cerebrovascular in-silico models, converted into synthetic
images via an MR-true reconstruction pipeline. A dedicated GAN architecture was
implemented and evaluated across three adversarial loss functions: Vanilla,
Relativistic, and Wasserstein. Our results demonstrate that the proposed GAN
improved near-wall velocity recovery compared to a non-adversarial reference
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 9.6%); however, that implementation specifics are critical
for stable network training. While Vanilla and Relativistic GANs proved
unstable compared to generator-only training (vNRMSE: 8.1% and 7.8% vs. 7.2%),
a Wasserstein GAN demonstrated optimal stability and incremental improvement
(vNRMSE: 6.9% vs. 7.2%). The Wasserstein GAN further outperformed the
generator-only baseline at low SNR (vNRMSE: 8.7% vs. 10.7%). These findings
highlight the potential of GAN-based super-resolution in enhancing 4D Flow MRI,
particularly in challenging cerebrovascular regions, while emphasizing the need
for careful selection of adversarial strategies.

Conclusion: DoSReMC提供了一种实用的方法，可以轻松集成到现有AI流程中，应用于多样化的临床环境，为实现更鲁棒和可泛化的乳腺X线摄影分类系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic
cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results
demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they
perform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and
they significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC
addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC)
layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate
this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding
additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be
readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于不确定性的动态MRI采集框架，通过概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，使用保形预测生成置信区间，实现按需自动终止扫描，在保证精度的同时显著缩短扫描时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI加速重建方法使用固定的加速因子，要么扫描时间过长，要么图像质量不足，无法为下游临床任务提供可靠的不确定性量化。需要一种能够根据个体需求动态调整扫描时间的个性化采集方法。

Method: 使用概率重建模型估计图像不确定性，通过保形预测转换为校准的置信区间。在采集过程中迭代采样k空间，更新重建结果并评估置信区间，当不确定性达到预设精度目标时自动终止扫描。

Result: 在膝关节和心脏MRI数据集上验证，相比固定协议显著减少扫描时间，同时为最终图像的精度提供正式的统计保证。

Conclusion: 该框架超越了固定加速因子，实现了患者特异性的采集，在扫描效率和诊断置信度之间取得平衡，是迈向个性化和资源高效MRI的重要一步。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers unparalleled soft-tissue contrast but
is fundamentally limited by long acquisition times. While deep learning-based
accelerated MRI can dramatically shorten scan times, the reconstruction from
undersampled data introduces ambiguity resulting from an ill-posed problem with
infinitely many possible solutions that propagates to downstream clinical
tasks. This uncertainty is usually ignored during the acquisition process as
acceleration factors are often fixed a priori, resulting in scans that are
either unnecessarily long or of insufficient quality for a given clinical
endpoint. This work introduces a dynamic, uncertainty-aware acquisition
framework that adjusts scan time on a per-subject basis. Our method leverages a
probabilistic reconstruction model to estimate image uncertainty, which is then
propagated through a full analysis pipeline to a quantitative metric of
interest (e.g., patellar cartilage volume or cardiac ejection fraction). We use
conformal prediction to transform this uncertainty into a rigorous, calibrated
confidence interval for the metric. During acquisition, the system iteratively
samples k-space, updates the reconstruction, and evaluates the confidence
interval. The scan terminates automatically once the uncertainty meets a
user-predefined precision target. We validate our framework on both knee and
cardiac MRI datasets. Our results demonstrate that this adaptive approach
reduces scan times compared to fixed protocols while providing formal
statistical guarantees on the precision of the final image. This framework
moves beyond fixed acceleration factors, enabling patient-specific acquisitions
that balance scan efficiency with diagnostic confidence, a critical step
towards personalized and resource-efficient MRI.

Conclusion: DECSC框架成功统一了多种高光谱图像特征表示，通过深度均衡模型提供了收敛保证，实现了优异的去噪效果

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 比较了三种模型：预训练U-Net、端到端训练的U-Net和CycleGAN模型，用于生成虚拟DES图像，并评估这些虚拟图像在良恶性分类任务中的性能。

Result: 预训练U-Net模型表现最佳，虚拟DES图像的F1分数为85.59%，真实DES图像为90.35%。虚拟图像虽略逊于真实图像，但差距较小。

Conclusion: 虚拟DES图像生成具有巨大潜力，未来技术进步可能进一步缩小性能差距，使其在临床上完全替代真实DES图像成为可能。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Conclusion: 标签信心是一个有价值的信号，如果适当利用，可以显著提高医学影像AI的可靠性和临床应用价值。

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出HessNet，一种基于Hessian矩阵的轻量级半监督神经网络，用于脑MRA血管分割，仅需6000参数即可在CPU上运行，达到最先进的分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑磁共振血管成像(MRA)中血管的精确分割对动脉瘤修复等手术至关重要，但目前缺乏公开的详细标注数据集，且传统方法精度不足

Method: 开发HessNet神经网络，结合Hessian矩阵进行3D管状结构分割，采用半监督学习方式，模型仅含6000个参数，可在CPU上运行

Result: 在最小训练数据集上达到最先进的分割精度，基于IXI数据集创建了包含200张图像的半手动标注脑血管数据集，由专家在HessNet辅助下完成标注

Conclusion: HessNet显著降低了神经网络训练资源需求，提供高精度血管分割，使专家能专注于复杂病例，创建的标注数据集已公开可用

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at
https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了人类大脑进行符号思维所需的最小神经机制，提出除了动态绑定外，还需要多位置谓词和结构映射两种层次整合能力。通过17个模拟实验验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解人类大脑为何能进行符号推理而大多数动物不能，探索符号思维所需的最小神经机制，特别是动态绑定是否足够。

Method: 设计了17个通用模拟实验，测试具有和不具有多位置谓词和结构映射能力的认知架构在各种任务中的表现。任务设计避免依赖诊断特征，专门测试这些能力。

Result: 实验结果支持假设：动态绑定加上多位置谓词和结构映射是基本符号思维的最小要求。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于理解人类大脑如何产生符号思维，揭示了生物智能与机器学习方法的差异，对生物启发的人工智能有重要启示。

Abstract: What is it about human brains that allows us to reason symbolically whereas
most other animals cannot? There is evidence that dynamic binding, the ability
to combine neurons into groups on the fly, is necessary for symbolic thought,
but there is also evidence that it is not sufficient. We propose that two kinds
of hierarchical integration (integration of multiple role-bindings into
multiplace predicates, and integration of multiple correspondences into
structure mappings) are minimal requirements, on top of basic dynamic binding,
to realize symbolic thought. We tested this hypothesis in a systematic
collection of 17 simulations that explored the ability of cognitive
architectures with and without the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping to perform various kinds of tasks. The simulations were as
generic as possible, in that no task could be performed based on any diagnostic
features, depending instead on the capacity for multi-place predicates and
structure mapping. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, along
with dynamic binding, multi-place predicates and structure mapping are minimal
requirements for basic symbolic thought. These results inform our understanding
of how human brains give rise to symbolic thought and speak to the differences
between biological intelligence, which tends to generalize broadly from very
few training examples, and modern approaches to machine learning, which
typically require millions or billions of training examples. The results we
report also have important implications for bio-inspired artificial
intelligence.

Motivation: 连续学习需要适应现实世界任务和数据分布的动态变化，同时减轻灾难性遗忘。尽管连续学习技术取得了显著进展，但其泛化性能的理论理解仍然滞后。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论研究高维线性模型中的连续岭回归，其中维度与每个任务的样本量成比例。推导渐近预测风险的精确表达式，并分析三个评估指标：平均风险、后向转移和前向转移。

Conclusion: 该研究为连续学习的理论理解提供了重要贡献，通过精确的风险表达式和风险曲线分析，揭示了模型规格对泛化性能的影响机制。

Abstract: Continual learning is motivated by the need to adapt to real-world dynamics
in tasks and data distribution while mitigating catastrophic forgetting.
Despite significant advances in continual learning techniques, the theoretical
understanding of their generalization performance lags behind. This paper
examines the theoretical properties of continual ridge regression in
high-dimensional linear models, where the dimension is proportional to the
sample size in each task. Using random matrix theory, we derive exact
expressions of the asymptotic prediction risk, thereby enabling the
characterization of three evaluation metrics of generalization performance in
continual learning: average risk, backward transfer, and forward transfer.
Furthermore, we present the theoretical risk curves to illustrate the trends in
these evaluation metrics throughout the continual learning process. Our
analysis reveals several intriguing phenomena in the risk curves, demonstrating
how model specifications influence the generalization performance. Simulation
studies are conducted to validate our theoretical findings.

TL;DR: 本文针对多变量断点回归设计(MRD)中的模糊性问题，提出了理论框架来识别和减少非合规行为，改进了生产系统中的因果效应估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际生产系统中经常涉及多个阈值和标准的决策制定，传统MRD方法将其转换为一维设计会引入非合规行为，需要开发理论工具来解决这一问题。

Method: 开发了多维截止规则下单位行为类型的分类系统，建立了存在性和识别条件，研究了规则分解对单位行为的影响，并通过模拟和半导体制造实际数据验证。

Result: 框架能够识别和移除非合规单位，降低估计方差，在光电半导体制造的实际应用中证明了其实用价值。

Conclusion: 提出的MRD框架为生产政策优化提供了有效的理论工具，特别在降低估计方差方面显示出实际应用价值。

Abstract: The RDD (regression discontinuity design) is a widely used framework for
identification and estimation of causal effects at a cutoff of a single running
variable. Practical settings, in particular those encountered in production
systems, often involve decision-making defined by multiple thresholds and
criteria. Common MRD (multi-score RDD) approaches transform these to a
one-dimensional design, to employ identification and estimation results.
However, this practice can introduce non-compliant behavior. We develop
theoretical tools to identify and reduce some of this "fuzziness" when
estimating the cutoff-effect on compliers of sub-rules. We provide a sound
definition and categorization of unit behavior types for multi-dimensional
cutoff-rules, extending existing categorizations. We identify conditions for
the existence and identification of the cutoff-effect on complier in multiple
dimensions, and specify when identification remains stable after excluding
nevertaker and alwaystaker. Further, we investigate how decomposing
cutoff-rules into simpler parts alters the unit behavior. This allows
identification and removal of non-compliant units potentially improving
estimates. We validate our framework on simulated and real-world data from
opto-electronic semiconductor manufacturing. Our empirical results demonstrate
the usability for refining production policies. Particularly we show that our
approach decreases the estimation variance, highlighting the practical value of
the MRD framework in manufacturing.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI测试评估方法可能没有充分考虑AI系统的战略性理解和计划能力，导致部署行为预测不准

Result: 提供了支持论点的证据，证明战略性考虑对AI评估的重要性，并引导出多个研究方向

Conclusion: 战略性理解是AI测试中的关键因素，游戏论框架能够为设计更有效的安全性评估提供理论基础

Abstract: This position paper argues for two claims regarding AI testing and
evaluation. First, to remain informative about deployment behaviour,
evaluations need account for the possibility that AI systems understand their
circumstances and reason strategically. Second, game-theoretic analysis can
inform evaluation design by formalising and scrutinising the reasoning in
evaluation-based safety cases. Drawing on examples from existing AI systems, a
review of relevant research, and formal strategic analysis of a stylised
evaluation scenario, we present evidence for these claims and motivate several
research directions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: DeCoDi是一种用于文本到图像扩散模型的去偏方法，通过修改推理过程避免潜在维度中的偏见概念区域，无需复杂或计算密集的干预，可应用于任何扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习去偏方法通常需要复杂或计算密集的干预，限制了实际应用。需要一种更易用、计算开销小的去偏方法，能够在不显著影响图像质量的情况下减少扩散模型中的偏见。

Method: DeCoDi通过改变扩散过程来避免潜在维度中偏见概念的区域，仅修改推理过程而不需要重新训练模型，具有可忽略的计算开销。

Result: 在两个独立人工评估者检查1200张生成图像后，证明该方法在减轻性别、种族和年龄偏见方面有效。GPT4o的自动偏见评估与人工评估在统计上没有显著差异，评估者间具有可靠的一致性水平。

Conclusion: DeCoDi方法能够显著改善扩散式文本到图像生成模型生成图像的多样性，具有广泛应用的潜力，为实践者提供了更易访问的去偏解决方案。

Abstract: We propose DeCoDi, a debiasing procedure for text-to-image diffusion-based
models that changes the inference procedure, does not significantly change
image quality, has negligible compute overhead, and can be applied in any
diffusion-based image generation model. DeCoDi changes the diffusion process to
avoid latent dimension regions of biased concepts. While most deep learning
debiasing methods require complex or compute-intensive interventions, our
method is designed to change only the inference procedure. Therefore, it is
more accessible to a wide range of practitioners. We show the effectiveness of
the method by debiasing for gender, ethnicity, and age for the concepts of
nurse, firefighter, and CEO. Two distinct human evaluators manually inspect
1,200 generated images. Their evaluation results provide evidence that our
method is effective in mitigating biases based on gender, ethnicity, and age.
We also show that an automatic bias evaluation performed by the GPT4o is not
significantly statistically distinct from a human evaluation. Our evaluation
shows promising results, with reliable levels of agreement between evaluators
and more coverage of protected attributes. Our method has the potential to
significantly improve the diversity of images it generates by diffusion-based
text-to-image generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要声学隐私或故意信号混淆的环境中，需要掩蔽基本操作产生的声学特征，防止目标区域的检测传感器捕捉到声源信号。

Method: 推导了三维强迫波动方程的解析准稳态周期解，研究了自掩蔽现象，使用球对称解的叠加来研究目标区域掩蔽，并开发了高效数值方法处理非球对称情况。

Result: 分析了使用一个或两个点力部署在声源附近进行目标区域掩蔽的性能，并进行了优化。

Conclusion: 该框架在海底声学通信安全、水下航行器隐身和声学监视防护等方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: In an environment where acoustic privacy or deliberate signal obfuscation is
desired, it is necessary to mask the acoustic signature generated in essential
operations. We consider the problem of masking the effect of an acoustic source
in a target region where possible detection sensors are located. Masking is
achieved by placing interference signals near the acoustic source. We introduce
a theoretical and computational framework for designing such interference
signals with the goal of minimizing the residual amplitude in the target
region. For the three-dimensional (3D) forced wave equation with spherical
symmetry, we derive analytical quasi-steady periodic solutions for several
canonical cases. We examine the phenomenon of self-masking where an acoustic
source with certain spatial forcing profile masks itself from detection outside
its forcing footprint. We then use superposition of spherically symmetric
solutions to investigate masking in a given target region. We analyze and
optimize the performance of using one or two point-forces deployed near the
acoustic source for masking in the target region. For the general case where
the spatial forcing profile of the acoustic source lacks spherical symmetry, we
develop an efficient numerical method for solving the 3D wave equation.
Potential applications of this work include undersea acoustic communication
security, undersea vehicles stealth, and protection against acoustic
surveillance.

Motivation: LLM在文本到SQL任务中存在错误倾向，查询歧义是主要障碍，导致用户意图误解和SQL生成不准确

Method: 引入细粒度歧义分类法识别影响数据库元素映射和LLM推理的歧义，通过多选问题获取用户反馈来重写模糊问题

Result: 在歧义查询数据集上达到87.2%的歧义检测精度，集成文本到SQL系统后SQL精确匹配准确率提升50%

Conclusion: AmbiSQL展示了显著的性能提升和实际可用性，为解决LLM在文本到SQL任务中的歧义问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

Conclusion: 物理系统可以通过多种不同方式实现鲁棒信息存储，多体记忆的物理特性比之前认识的要丰富得多

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Conclusion: 该方法为高效研究临界现象建立了新范式，具有显著计算优势，可直接应用于其他经典或量子多体系统

Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome
the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We
demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained
only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse
temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger
system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without
retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key
thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is
enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous,
temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the
underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are
scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a
new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a
significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The
method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems
described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Conclusion: Hadamard可分解性受到深层代数约束，矩阵密度是强预测因子，分解空间维度远低于参数数量预期的24维

Abstract: We computationally resolve an open problem concerning the expressibility of
$4 \times 4$ full-rank matrices as Hadamard products of two rank-2 matrices.
Through exhaustive search over $\mathbb{F}_2$, we identify 5,304
counterexamples among the 20,160 full-rank binary matrices (26.3\%). We verify
that these counterexamples remain valid over $\mathbb{Z}$ through sign
enumeration and provide strong numerical evidence for their validity over
$\mathbb{R}$.
  Remarkably, our analysis reveals that matrix density (number of ones) is
highly predictive of expressibility, achieving 95.7\% classification accuracy.
Using modern machine learning techniques, we discover that expressible matrices
lie on an approximately 10-dimensional variety within the 16-dimensional
ambient space, despite the naive parameter count of 24 (12 parameters each for
two $4 \times 4$ rank-2 matrices). This emergent low-dimensional structure
suggests deep algebraic constraints governing Hadamard factorizability.

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet在数据稀疏、冷启动严重的环境中能够提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

*Simon Lepage,Jeremie Mary,David Picard*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了COSETTE对比标记化方法和MARIUS轻量级生成模型，解决了生成式推荐系统中缺乏协同信号和编码器-解码器架构效率低下的问题，显著提升了生成式推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐系统在实践中往往表现不如传统的基于ID的模型，主要存在两个关键限制：项目标记化中缺乏协同信号，以及编码器-解码器架构的效率低下。

Method: 提出了COSETTE对比标记化方法，将协同信息直接整合到学习到的项目表示中，同时优化内容重建和推荐相关性；设计了MARIUS轻量级生成模型，将时间线建模与项目解码分离，降低推理成本。

Result: 在标准序列推荐基准测试中，该方法缩小甚至消除了生成式模型与现代基于ID模型之间的性能差距，同时保留了生成范式的优势。

Conclusion: 通过整合协同信号和优化模型架构，生成式推荐系统可以达到与传统ID模型相当甚至更好的性能，为推荐系统的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出基于效用的推荐系统框架，通过成对比较学习用户偏好，使用主动采样策略优化推荐效果，在电影推荐和大学招生场景中验证了有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖数值评分或完整排名，但评分存在行为偏差且主观，获取完整排名不现实，需要更准确高效的用户偏好学习方法

Method: 基于Plackett-Luce概率框架的成对比较偏好模型，提出效用驱动的主动采样策略，支持矩阵分解和神经网络两种实现方式

Result: 实验证明该框架在电影推荐和大学招生场景中提供了更准确、数据效率更高、以用户为中心的个性化排序方案

Conclusion: 该效用框架为推荐系统提供了灵活、高效的偏好学习范式，能够显式优化任务特定的效用目标，提升推荐质量

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Motivation: 传统推荐方法在冷启动和稀疏数据场景下表现不佳，现有解决方案要么生成伪交互序列引入噪声，要么过度依赖语义相似性而忽略用户动机的动态变化

Method: M-LLM³REC包含三个模块：动机导向配置文件提取器(MOPE)、动机导向特征编码器(MOTE)和动机对齐推荐器(MAR)，通过动机驱动的语义建模实现个性化推荐

Result: 在冷启动情况下相比最先进框架显著提升性能，实现了鲁棒、个性化和可泛化的推荐

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度动机信号提取有效解决了推荐系统中的冷启动和稀疏数据挑战，为个性化推荐提供了新思路

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于图的ANNS已成为现代AI应用的主导范式，但现有方法主要关注算法创新而忽视了显著影响执行时间的内存布局考虑因素。

Method: 开发统一的评估框架，包括图适配器(将任意图拓扑转换为通用表示)和GPU优化的图遍历引擎，引入分析指标量化结构属性与内存布局有效性的关系。

Result: 在多样化数据集和最先进图索引上的综合分析显示，GPU定向重排序可在保持搜索精度的同时实现高达15%的QPS提升。

Conclusion: 内存布局优化与现有算法创新正交，是提升图ANNS性能的重要方向，所有代码将在发表时开源以促进可重复性和进一步研究。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

TL;DR: 本论文统计了基于反馈的高级检索和排名机制，以改善静态RAG框架在复杂任务中的性能限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG已成为知识密集型NLP任务的标准框架，但大多数RAG流水线将检索和推理作为孤立组件，这种静态设计限制了在需要迭代证据收集或高精度检索的复杂任务中的性能

Method: 通过整合IR和NLP领域的最新进展，结构化概述了集成反馈机制的高级检索和排名方法，并根据反馈信号的来源和作用进行分类

Result: 展示了通过动态可学习的检索组件来改善RAG系统性能的方法，为建立更有效的端到端RAG系统提供了理论基础

Conclusion: 本调查研究有助于渗透IR和NLP视角，强调检索作为端到端RAG系统中动态可学习组件的重要性，为未来RAG框架的发展指明了方向

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: 提出MMQ框架，通过多模态混合量化解决语义ID在推荐系统中的跨模态协同与行为语义差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ItemID方法在大规模动态物品库和稀疏长尾数据上表现不佳，语义ID虽能映射到共享语义空间但面临跨模态协同与行为语义对齐的挑战

Method: 两阶段框架：1)共享-特定分词器使用多专家架构和正交正则化捕获多模态信息；2)行为感知微调通过多模态重构损失动态适应推荐目标

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试表明MMQ有效统一了多模态协同、特异性和行为适应性

Conclusion: MMQ为生成式检索和判别式排序任务提供了可扩展的通用解决方案

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: 该综述为AI安全和隐私领域的研究者、从业者和政策制定者提供了有价值的参考，指出了未来研究的有前景方向

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and
utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial
computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted
their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have
addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable
access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this
accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also
introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs).
Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate
a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces,
posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this
paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense
strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to
attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis
covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights
challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off
between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs
within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical,
legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future
research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for
researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and
privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated
with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

TL;DR: 本文提出RAGAN攻击框架，利用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力生成高质量虚假用户档案，提升推荐系统中毒攻击的转移性和隐蔽性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推荐系统容易受到数据中毒攻击，但攻击者在黑盒设置下资源有限，生成的虚假文本评论质量差，影响攻击效果和隐蔽性

Method: 使用多模态基础模型的上下文学习能力，结合演示检索算法和文本风格转换策略，通过jailbreaker、instructional agent和guardian协同优化生成高质量虚假用户档案

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，RAGAN实现了最先进的中毒攻击性能

Conclusion: RAGAN框架能有效生成高质量虚假用户档案，为评估推荐系统鲁棒性提供了有力工具

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: MoEcho揭示了混合专家(MoE)架构中的侧信道安全漏洞，攻击者可以通过硬件执行痕迹推断用户敏感数据，提出了四种新型侧信道攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE架构在Transformer模型中的广泛应用，其动态路由机制虽然提高了效率，但输入依赖的激活模式在硬件层面留下了可被利用的痕迹，构成了新的隐私泄露攻击面。

Method: 提出了四种新型架构侧信道：CPU上的缓存占用信道和页出+重加载，GPU上的性能计数器和TLB驱逐+重加载。基于这些漏洞设计了四种攻击方法，针对基于MoE的大型语言模型和视觉语言模型。

Result: 成功实现了提示推断攻击、响应重构攻击、视觉推断攻击和视觉重构攻击，证明了MoE架构存在严重的隐私安全威胁。

Conclusion: 这是首次对现代Transformer中流行的MoE结构进行运行时架构级安全分析，揭示了严重的安全隐私威胁，呼吁在利用MoE模型开发高效大规模AI服务时需要及时有效的安全防护措施。

Abstract: The transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern AI, fueling
remarkable progress across applications in natural language processing,
computer vision, and multimodal learning. As these models continue to scale
explosively for performance, implementation efficiency remains a critical
challenge. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, selectively activating
specialized subnetworks (experts), offer a unique balance between model
accuracy and computational cost. However, the adaptive routing in MoE
architectures, where input tokens are dynamically directed to specialized
experts based on their semantic meaning inadvertently opens up a new attack
surface for privacy breaches. These input-dependent activation patterns leave
distinctive temporal and spatial traces in hardware execution, which
adversaries could exploit to deduce sensitive user data. In this work, we
propose MoEcho, discovering a side channel analysis based attack surface that
compromises user privacy on MoE based systems. Specifically, in MoEcho, we
introduce four novel architectural side channels on different computing
platforms, including Cache Occupancy Channels and Pageout+Reload on CPUs, and
Performance Counter and TLB Evict+Reload on GPUs, respectively. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities, we propose four attacks that effectively breach user
privacy in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) based
on MoE architectures: Prompt Inference Attack, Response Reconstruction Attack,
Visual Inference Attack, and Visual Reconstruction Attack. MoEcho is the first
runtime architecture level security analysis of the popular MoE structure
common in modern transformers, highlighting a serious security and privacy
threat and calling for effective and timely safeguards when harnessing MoE
based models for developing efficient large scale AI services.

TL;DR: IPIGuard是一种新的防御间接提示注入攻击的方法，通过将智能体任务执行建模为工具依赖图遍历，分离动作规划与外部数据交互，显著减少恶意工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体防御方法依赖模型自身安全性假设，缺乏对智能体行为的结构化约束，容易受到更强攻击向量的绕过。

Method: 提出IPIGuard防御框架，将智能体任务执行过程建模为工具依赖图(TDG)遍历，明确分离动作规划和外部数据交互。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，IPIGuard在有效性和鲁棒性之间实现了优越的平衡。

Conclusion: IPIGuard通过结构化约束智能体行为，显著增强了对抗间接提示注入攻击的鲁棒性，为动态环境中更安全的智能体系统开发铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MCPTox是首个系统评估LLM智能体在MCP环境中对工具投毒攻击鲁棒性的基准测试，发现主流模型存在广泛漏洞，攻击成功率高达72.8%，且现有安全对齐机制对此类攻击无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model Context Protocol (MCP)为LLM智能体提供标准化外部工具接口，但引入了新的攻击面。现有研究主要关注通过工具输出注入的攻击，而本文研究更根本的漏洞：工具投毒攻击，即在工具元数据中嵌入恶意指令而不需要执行。

Method: 构建MCPTox基准测试，基于45个真实MCP服务器和353个真实工具，设计三种攻击模板通过少样本学习生成1312个恶意测试用例，覆盖10类潜在风险类别，在20个主流LLM智能体上进行评估。

Result: 评估显示LLM智能体普遍存在工具投毒漏洞，o1-mini攻击成功率高达72.8%。能力更强的模型往往更容易受到攻击，因为攻击利用了其优越的指令遵循能力。拒绝率极低（最高不到3%），表明现有安全对齐对此类攻击无效。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和缓解这一广泛威胁提供了重要的实证基准，发布了MCPTox数据集用于开发可验证更安全的AI智能体，揭示了现有安全机制的局限性。

Abstract: By providing a standardized interface for LLM agents to interact with
external tools, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is quickly becoming a
cornerstone of the modern autonomous agent ecosystem. However, it creates novel
attack surfaces due to untrusted external tools. While prior work has focused
on attacks injected through external tool outputs, we investigate a more
fundamental vulnerability: Tool Poisoning, where malicious instructions are
embedded within a tool's metadata without execution. To date, this threat has
been primarily demonstrated through isolated cases, lacking a systematic,
large-scale evaluation.
  We introduce MCPTox, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate agent
robustness against Tool Poisoning in realistic MCP settings. MCPTox is
constructed upon 45 live, real-world MCP servers and 353 authentic tools. To
achieve this, we design three distinct attack templates to generate a
comprehensive suite of 1312 malicious test cases by few-shot learning, covering
10 categories of potential risks. Our evaluation on 20 prominent LLM agents
setting reveals a widespread vulnerability to Tool Poisoning, with o1-mini,
achieving an attack success rate of 72.8\%. We find that more capable models
are often more susceptible, as the attack exploits their superior
instruction-following abilities. Finally, the failure case analysis reveals
that agents rarely refuse these attacks, with the highest refused rate
(Claude-3.7-Sonnet) less than 3\%, demonstrating that existing safety alignment
is ineffective against malicious actions that use legitimate tools for
unauthorized operation. Our findings create a crucial empirical baseline for
understanding and mitigating this widespread threat, and we release MCPTox for
the development of verifiably safer AI agents. Our dataset is available at an
anonymized repository: \textit{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AAAI26-7C02}.

Method: NetSight采用新颖的伪标签技术消除人工干预，并使用基于知识蒸馏的适应策略来防止灾难性遗忘，实现在线持续检测和适应分布偏移。

Result: 在三个长期网络数据集上的评估显示，NetSight相比依赖人工标注的最先进方法表现出更优的适应性能，F1分数提升最高达11.72%。

Conclusion: NetSight证明了其在经历分布偏移的动态网络中具有鲁棒性和有效性，能够有效解决分布偏移带来的挑战。

Abstract: Distribution shift, a change in the statistical properties of data over time,
poses a critical challenge for deep learning anomaly detection systems.
Existing anomaly detection systems often struggle to adapt to these shifts.
Specifically, systems based on supervised learning require costly manual
labeling, while those based on unsupervised learning rely on clean data, which
is difficult to obtain, for shift adaptation. Both of these requirements are
challenging to meet in practice. In this paper, we introduce NetSight, a
framework for supervised anomaly detection in network data that continually
detects and adapts to distribution shifts in an online manner. NetSight
eliminates manual intervention through a novel pseudo-labeling technique and
uses a knowledge distillation-based adaptation strategy to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. Evaluated on three long-term network datasets, NetSight
demonstrates superior adaptation performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods that rely on manual labeling, achieving F1-score improvements of up to
11.72%. This proves its robustness and effectiveness in dynamic networks that
experience distribution shifts over time.

Motivation: 随着数据隐私和监管合规要求的增长，联邦学习中的机器遗忘技术变得越来越重要。然而，将遗忘机制整合到联邦学习中引入了新的安全风险，特别是攻击者可能利用遗忘过程破坏全局模型的完整性。

Method: 提出了BadFU攻击策略：恶意客户端在联邦训练过程中使用后门样本和伪装样本正常训练全局模型，然后请求遗忘伪装样本，使全局模型转变为后门状态。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has been widely adopted as a decentralized training
paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared model
without exposing their local data. As concerns over data privacy and regulatory
compliance grow, machine unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data from trained models, has become increasingly important in the
federated setting to meet legal, ethical, or user-driven demands. However,
integrating unlearning into FL introduces new challenges and raises largely
unexplored security risks. In particular, adversaries may exploit the
unlearning process to compromise the integrity of the global model. In this
paper, we present the first backdoor attack in the context of federated
unlearning, demonstrating that an adversary can inject backdoors into the
global model through seemingly legitimate unlearning requests. Specifically, we
propose BadFU, an attack strategy where a malicious client uses both backdoor
and camouflage samples to train the global model normally during the federated
training process. Once the client requests unlearning of the camouflage
samples, the global model transitions into a backdoored state. Extensive
experiments under various FL frameworks and unlearning strategies validate the
effectiveness of BadFU, revealing a critical vulnerability in current federated
unlearning practices and underscoring the urgent need for more secure and
robust federated unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) has emerged as a transformative technology,
demonstrating remarkable capabilities across diverse application domains.
However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and
efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency.
This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should

principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems.
  We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five
key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and
assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells,
organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient
and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a
GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from
technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the
need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire
future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this
conceptual framework.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了知识蒸馏(KD)在代码理解任务中的有效性，发现KD能显著提升不同规模学生模型的性能，代码专用PLM作为教师模型效果更好，最新特征蒸馏方法可让学生模型仅用5%参数达到教师模型98%的性能。


<details>

Result: KD在所有规模学生模型上都带来显著性能提升；代码专用PLM作为教师模型效果更好；最新特征蒸馏方法表现最佳，学生模型仅用5%参数即可保留教师98%性能；学生架构与教师相似性不一定带来更好性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是提升代码理解模型效率的有效方法，特征蒸馏方法尤其有前景，为实际部署提供了重要指导，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code
understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces
practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference
latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and
acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge
from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient
inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this
technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and
computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains
largely underexplored.
  In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of
KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD
methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across
eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three
downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers
notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared
with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better
effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest
feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models
to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding
student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher
architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further
discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize
the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位恢复方法依赖特定近似条件和边界条件，需要专家手动调参，难以适应复杂多变的实验条件。深度学习方法的训练数据获取困难限制了其应用范围。

Method: 使用物理信息生成对抗网络，从单张全息图中重建样品平面的未传播波场相位和吸收信息，无需配对、非配对或模拟训练数据。

Conclusion: 该方法显著拓宽了相位恢复技术的应用范围，能够同时获取相位和吸收信息，适用于各种复杂的实验配置和样品类型。

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

TL;DR: GenTune是一个帮助设计师理解AI生成提示与图像内容映射关系的系统，通过可视化选择图像元素并追踪对应提示标签，实现精确且全局一致的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计师在使用生成式AI时面临两个主要挑战：LLM生成的长提示难以理解和修改特定视觉元素的关键词；局部修复工具难以保持全局一致性和正确性。

Method: 开发GenTune系统，允许设计师选择生成图像中的任何元素，追踪到对应的提示标签，并通过修改这些标签来指导精确且全局一致的图像优化。

Result: 在20名设计师的总结性研究中，GenTune相比现有方法显著提高了提示-图像理解、优化质量和效率，以及整体满意度（所有p<0.01）。实地研究进一步证明了其在真实环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: GenTune通过澄清AI生成提示与图像内容的映射关系，有效增强了人机协作，解决了设计师在使用生成式AI时遇到的关键挑战。

Abstract: Environment designers in the entertainment industry create imaginative 2D and
3D scenes for games, films, and television, requiring both fine-grained control
of specific details and consistent global coherence. Designers have
increasingly integrated generative AI into their workflows, often relying on
large language models (LLMs) to expand user prompts for text-to-image
generation, then iteratively refining those prompts and applying inpainting.
However, our formative study with 10 designers surfaced two key challenges: (1)
the lengthy LLM-generated prompts make it difficult to understand and isolate
the keywords that must be revised for specific visual elements; and (2) while
inpainting supports localized edits, it can struggle with global consistency
and correctness. Based on these insights, we present GenTune, an approach that
enhances human--AI collaboration by clarifying how AI-generated prompts map to
image content. Our GenTune system lets designers select any element in a
generated image, trace it back to the corresponding prompt labels, and revise
those labels to guide precise yet globally consistent image refinement. In a
summative study with 20 designers, GenTune significantly improved prompt--image
comprehension, refinement quality, and efficiency, and overall satisfaction
(all $p < .01$) compared to current practice. A follow-up field study with two
studios further demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis stands at the forefront of neuroscience
and artificial intelligence research, where foundation models are reshaping the
traditional EEG analysis paradigm by leveraging their powerful representational
capacity and cross-modal generalization. However, the rapid proliferation of
these techniques has led to a fragmented research landscape, characterized by
diverse model roles, inconsistent architectures, and a lack of systematic
categorization. To bridge this gap, this study presents the first comprehensive
modality-oriented taxonomy for foundation models in EEG analysis,
systematically organizing research advances based on output modalities of the
native EEG decoding, EEG-text, EEG-vision, EEG-audio, and broader multimodal
frameworks. We rigorously analyze each category's research ideas, theoretical
foundations, and architectural innovations, while highlighting open challenges
such as model interpretability, cross-domain generalization, and real-world
applicability in EEG-based systems. By unifying this dispersed field, our work
not only provides a reference framework for future methodology development but
accelerates the translation of EEG foundation models into scalable,
interpretable, and online actionable solutions.

TL;DR: 本研究通过信息级联范式分析9个主流大语言模型的社会从众行为，发现在不确定性调节下，LLMs主要受信息性影响驱动，但在高不确定性条件下会出现类似规范性影响的信号放大效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入协作团队，其社会从众性（倾向于与多数意见保持一致）成为关键问题。需要了解LLMs是否遵循人类心理学机制，即信息性影响（理性使用群体线索）和规范性影响（社会压力）的平衡。

Method: 采用行为经济学的信息级联范式，在医疗、法律、投资三个决策场景中评估9个领先LLM，通过操纵信息不确定性（q = 0.667, 0.55, 0.70）来量化分析两种驱动因素。

Result: 结果显示信息性影响是模型行为的基础机制，准确性和置信度随证据强度一致上升。不确定性显著调节这一机制：中低不确定性下表现为保守策略（系统性地低估所有证据源），高不确定性下则出现规范性放大效应（公开信号权重β > 1.55 vs 私有信号β = 0.81）。

Conclusion: LLMs的社会从众行为主要由信息性影响驱动，但高不确定性会触发向规范性类似行为的临界转变，表明不确定性在调节LLM决策过程中扮演关键角色。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds
substantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,
many current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,
and complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for
synthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this
background, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can
reliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the
use of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method
for synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we
replicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and
compared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood
pressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and
diabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO
Gesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family
Health Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and
variable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables
relevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all
replicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications
consistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively
low sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely
matched the original results across various descriptive and inferential
analyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced
both quality and stability of the results.

Motivation: mRNA治疗和合成生物学的重要性日益增长，需要能够捕捉同义密码子使用潜在结构的模型，现有方法未能充分建模遗传密码固有的对称性关系。

Method: 引入Equi-mRNA模型，将同义密码子对称性编码为2D特殊正交矩阵(SO(2))的循环子群，结合群论先验、等变损失和对称感知池化。

Result: 在表达、稳定性和核糖开关切换等预测任务中准确率提升约10%；序列生成中，mRNA构建体的真实性提高4倍，功能属性保持能力提升28%。

Conclusion: Equi-mRNA建立了基于生物学原理的mRNA建模新范式，为下一代治疗设计提供了重要工具，学习到的密码子旋转分布揭示了已知的GC含量偏好和tRNA丰度模式。

Abstract: The growing importance of mRNA therapeutics and synthetic biology highlights
the need for models that capture the latent structure of synonymous codon
(different triplets encoding the same amino acid) usage, which subtly modulates
translation efficiency and gene expression. While recent efforts incorporate
codon-level inductive biases through auxiliary objectives, they often fall
short of explicitly modeling the structured relationships that arise from the
genetic code's inherent symmetries. We introduce Equi-mRNA, the first
codon-level equivariant mRNA language model that explicitly encodes synonymous
codon symmetries as cyclic subgroups of 2D Special Orthogonal matrix (SO(2)).
By combining group-theoretic priors with an auxiliary equivariance loss and
symmetry-aware pooling, Equi-mRNA learns biologically grounded representations
that outperform vanilla baselines across multiple axes. On downstream
property-prediction tasks including expression, stability, and riboswitch
switching Equi-mRNA delivers up to approximately 10% improvements in accuracy.
In sequence generation, it produces mRNA constructs that are up to
approximately 4x more realistic under Frechet BioDistance metrics and
approximately 28% better preserve functional properties compared to vanilla
baseline. Interpretability analyses further reveal that learned codon-rotation
distributions recapitulate known GC-content biases and tRNA abundance patterns,
offering novel insights into codon usage. Equi-mRNA establishes a new
biologically principled paradigm for mRNA modeling, with significant
implications for the design of next-generation therapeutics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于压缩和适应两大核心特性的原生AI驱动的6G空口架构，通过语义通信实现任务相关的高效信息传输


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能需要成为6G网络全生命周期的基础能力，从设计、部署到运营都需要AI的深度参与，因此需要构建原生AI驱动的空口架构

Method: 采用压缩和适应两大核心特性：压缩技术从源数据中理解和提取关键语义信息，关注任务相关性而非符号级精度；适应技术使空口能够跨不同任务、数据类型和信道条件动态传输语义信息

Result: 提出了完整的原生AI驱动空口架构，讨论了代表性使能方法，并通过6G非地面网络中的语义通信案例进行了验证

Conclusion: 原生AI在6G中具有广阔前景，但仍面临关键挑战和研究机遇，需要进一步探索和发展

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to serve as a foundational
capability across the entire lifecycle of 6G networks, spanning design,
deployment, and operation. This article proposes a native AI-driven air
interface architecture built around two core characteristics: compression and
adaptation. On one hand, compression enables the system to understand and
extract essential semantic information from the source data, focusing on task
relevance rather than symbol-level accuracy. On the other hand, adaptation
allows the air interface to dynamically transmit semantic information across
diverse tasks, data types, and channel conditions, ensuring scalability and
robustness. This article first introduces the native AI-driven air interface
architecture, then discusses representative enabling methodologies, followed by
a case study on semantic communication in 6G non-terrestrial networks. Finally,
it presents a forward-looking discussion on the future of native AI in 6G,
outlining key challenges and research opportunities.

TL;DR: 本文研究了一个集成感知、通信和计算的空中联邦边缘学习系统，分析了无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对收敛行为的影响，并提出了低复杂度算法来协调批大小控制和资源分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究集成感知、通信和计算(ISCC)的空中联邦边缘学习系统，解决无线感知噪声和空中计算失真对机器学习模型训练收敛性的影响，优化网络资源分配以提高学习性能。

Method: 采用空中计算(AirComp)实现一次性模型聚合，分析ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL的收敛行为，设计交替优化批大小控制和网络资源分配的低复杂度ISCC算法。

Result: 理论分析表明感知、通信和计算竞争网络资源共同决定收敛速率。数值实验验证了理论分析，提出的ISCC算法能有效协调批大小控制和资源分配来提升学习性能。

Conclusion: ISCC系统中的感知、通信和计算过程紧密耦合，通过优化批大小控制和资源分配可以显著提升联邦边缘学习的性能，为集成感知通信计算系统提供了有效的设计方法。

Abstract: This paper studies an over-the-air federated edge learning (Air-FEEL) system
with integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC), in which one
edge server coordinates multiple edge devices to wirelessly sense the objects
and use the sensing data to collaboratively train a machine learning model for
recognition tasks. In this system, over-the-air computation (AirComp) is
employed to enable one-shot model aggregation from edge devices. Under this
setup, we analyze the convergence behavior of the ISCC-enabled Air-FEEL in
terms of the loss function degradation, by particularly taking into account the
wireless sensing noise during the training data acquisition and the AirComp
distortions during the over-the-air model aggregation. The result theoretically
shows that sensing, communication, and computation compete for network
resources to jointly decide the convergence rate. Based on the analysis, we
design the ISCC parameters under the target of maximizing the loss function
degradation while ensuring the latency and energy budgets in each round. The
challenge lies on the tightly coupled processes of sensing, communication, and
computation among different devices. To tackle the challenge, we derive a
low-complexity ISCC algorithm by alternately optimizing the batch size control
and the network resource allocation. It is found that for each device, less
sensing power should be consumed if a larger batch of data samples is obtained
and vice versa. Besides, with a given batch size, the optimal computation speed
of one device is the minimum one that satisfies the latency constraint.
Numerical results based on a human motion recognition task verify the
theoretical convergence analysis and show that the proposed ISCC algorithm well
coordinates the batch size control and resource allocation among sensing,
communication, and computation to enhance the learning performance.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模拟内存计算系统的故障容错和编译效率瓶颈，为大规模部署提供了可行的技术路径

Abstract: This paper addresses two critical challenges in analog In-Memory Computing
(IMC) systems that limit their scalability and deployability: the computational
unreliability caused by stuck-at faults (SAFs) and the high compilation
overhead of existing fault-mitigation algorithms, namely Fault-Free (FF). To
overcome these limitations, we first propose a novel multi-bit weight
representation technique, termed row-column hybrid grouping, which generalizes
conventional column grouping by introducing redundancy across both rows and
columns. This structural redundancy enhances fault tolerance and can be
effectively combined with existing fault-mitigation solutions. Second, we
design a compiler pipeline that reformulates the fault-aware weight
decomposition problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) task, enabling
fast and scalable compilation through off-the-shelf solvers. Further
acceleration is achieved through theoretical insights that identify fault
patterns amenable to trivial solutions, significantly reducing computation.
Experimental results on convolutional networks and small language models
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 8%p improvement
in accuracy, 150x faster compilation, and 2x energy efficiency gain compared to
existing baselines.

Motivation: 复杂性状受多个遗传变异、环境风险因素及其交互作用影响，但检测高阶交互作用面临计算复杂度和特征空间爆炸的挑战。

Method: 开发U-Statistic-based随机森林方法（Forest U-Test），通过递归分区处理高维遗传关联研究中的交互作用检测问题。

Result: 模拟研究显示优于现有方法；在大麻依赖研究中检测到显著联合关联（p<0.001），并在两个独立数据集中成功复制（p=5.93e-19和4.70e-17）。

Conclusion: Forest U-Test是检测遗传交互作用的有效工具，为复杂性状的遗传机制研究提供了新方法。

Abstract: Variations in complex traits are influenced by multiple genetic variants,
environmental risk factors, and their interactions. Though substantial progress
has been made in identifying single genetic variants associated with complex
traits, detecting the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions remains a
great challenge. When a large number of genetic variants and environmental risk
factors are involved, searching for interactions is limited to pair-wise
interactions due to the exponentially increased feature space and computational
intensity. Alternatively, recursive partitioning approaches, such as random
forests, have gained popularity in high-dimensional genetic association
studies. In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest
approach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with
quantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest
U-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to
study Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study
of Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was
detected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also
replicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,
respectively.

Conclusion: AGP数据集旨在推动研究社区利用基因信息、高阶基因配对和多源性状数据，准确理解基因型与表型之间的联系

Abstract: Understanding which genes control which traits in an organism remains one of
the central challenges in biology. Despite significant advances in data
collection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.
This genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including
plant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,
heterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many
datasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype
information. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many
datasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are
not integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same
biological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be
informed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of
correlations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate
predictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics
(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles
with phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in
plant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and
interpretable graph learning. In addition, we benchmark conventional regression
and explanatory baselines, including a biologically-informed hypergraph
baseline, to validate gene-trait associations. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first dataset that provides multi-modal gene information and
heterogeneous trait or phenotype data for the same Arabidopsis thaliana
specimens. With AGP, we aim to foster the research community towards accurately
understanding the connection between genotypes and phenotypes using gene
information, higher-order gene pairings, and trait data from several sources.

TL;DR: JEDI-linear是一种新型图神经网络架构，专为FPGA硬件触发系统设计，具有线性计算复杂度，通过量化感知训练和分布式算术实现高效推理，在延迟和资源使用方面显著优于现有方案。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络（特别是交互网络）在CERN HL-LHC的喷注标记任务中表现出色，但其计算复杂度和不规则内存访问模式难以满足FPGA硬件触发系统的严格延迟和资源约束要求。

Method: 提出JEDI-linear架构，通过共享变换和全局聚合消除显式成对交互；采用细粒度量化感知训练和逐参数位宽优化；使用基于分布式算术的无乘法器乘累加操作。

Result: FPGA实现显示：延迟降低3.7-11.5倍，启动间隔降低高达150倍，LUT使用降低高达6.2倍，同时提供更高模型精度，完全无需DSP模块（而现有方案需要8700+个DSP），首次实现低于60ns延迟。

Conclusion: 该工作满足了HL-LHC CMS Level-1触发系统要求，通过实现准确、可扩展且资源高效的GNN实时推理，推动了下一代触发系统的发展，开源模板将支持科学应用的广泛采用。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), particularly Interaction Networks (INs), have
shown exceptional performance for jet tagging at the CERN High-Luminosity Large
Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their computational complexity and irregular
memory access patterns pose significant challenges for deployment on FPGAs in
hardware trigger systems, where strict latency and resource constraints apply.
In this work, we propose JEDI-linear, a novel GNN architecture with linear
computational complexity that eliminates explicit pairwise interactions by
leveraging shared transformations and global aggregation. To further enhance
hardware efficiency, we introduce fine-grained quantization-aware training with
per-parameter bitwidth optimization and employ multiplier-free
multiply-accumulate operations via distributed arithmetic. Evaluation results
show that our FPGA-based JEDI-linear achieves 3.7 to 11.5 times lower latency,
up to 150 times lower initiation interval, and up to 6.2 times lower LUT usage
compared to state-of-the-art designs while also delivering higher model
accuracy and eliminating the need for DSP blocks entirely. In contrast,
state-of-the-art solutions consume over 8,700 DSPs. This is the first
interaction-based GNN to achieve less than 60~ns latency and currently meets
the requirements for use in the HL-LHC CMS Level-1 trigger system. This work
advances the next-generation trigger systems by enabling accurate, scalable,
and resource-efficient GNN inference in real-time environments. Our
open-sourced templates will further support reproducibility and broader
adoption across scientific applications.

Reference models,\ncritical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming\nmore intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by\nlarge language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating\ncomplex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model\ngeneration and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from\ndesign specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating\ndesign standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a\nbuilding-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design\ncapabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts\nverification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying\ncomplexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and\nquality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance\nimprovement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable\nenhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its\ncapacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the\niterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of\n5.90x compared to traditional approaches.

They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments,\nwhich can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting\nrich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable\nstructures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception,\ncreating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this\nintegration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to\ngeneralize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate\nto analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which\niteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of\nits entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural\nnetworks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a\nsymbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2%\naccuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It\nalso demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints\nand delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure\nwhile aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments.

As a crucial component for developing\nthese reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through\ntrial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent\non-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths.\nIn this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a\nnovel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy\nupdate and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of\nlow hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized\nlong-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting\nperiods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we\npropose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage\nestimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of\npolicy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that\nallows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models. By\nselectively filtering prompt and truncated tokens, this mechanism reduces\nredundant computations and accelerates the training process without sacrificing\nconvergence performance.

However, in-home meal\nassistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g.,\neating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV),\nfood items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we\npropose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized\nin-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed\nin collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative\nstudy with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three\nkey tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and\nsafety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that\nenables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii)\ndiverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and\nphysical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences,\nand (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently\nadapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the\npersonalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating\nthat FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and\noutperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To\ndemonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two\ncare recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each\nacross three diverse scenarios.

Achieving\nautonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and\nunfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due\nto the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision\nmaking especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP),\nwhich limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light\nDetection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally\noptimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe\ntrajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address\nthese challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that\nrelies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D\nmap of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that\nfuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser,\nand less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this\nmap, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable\nof rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories.

We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure\nlearning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel,\ncomprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC\ncomponents through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC\nintroduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet\n(inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a\nhomogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing\nautoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that\ndynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input\ndata complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that\nABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity\nand broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression\nperformance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with\nvarious NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a\nrobust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.\nCode is available in https://github.com/worldlife123/cbench_BaSIC.", "AI": {"tldr": "ABC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\uff08NIC\uff09\u56e0\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "ABC\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u6784\u4e8c\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u7ba1\u7406\u795e\u7ecf\u4e3b\u5e72\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u3001\u540c\u6784\u591a\u5206\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5355\u5143\u5904\u7406\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eABC\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ABC\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cdNIC\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional methods typically treat\neach new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example,\nif a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must\nlearn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for\nprioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context\ninfluences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the\n$\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove\nheat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety\npreference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn\ncontext-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing\nbetween preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data\nrequirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling\ncontext-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature\nsaliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts.\nTo achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations\nthat capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized\npaired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient\nlearning.

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with\nhigh acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits\nscalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent\nstudies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they\noften overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS\nmodels to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality\nyet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a\ndata-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1)\nautomated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic\nselection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3)\nevaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean\nopinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance.\nFurthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a\nclosed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data\ncleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive\nexperiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms\nconventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and\nspeaker diversity of synthesized speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "TTSOps\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4ebaTTS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002TTSOps\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3TTS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "TTSOps\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bMOS\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e5\u8bedYouTube\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTTSOps\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TTSOps\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86TTS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find\nthat there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language\nstate representation. In particular, we observe that representations which\nprovide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language\nrepresentations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw\npayoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior\nthat more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more\nstable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit\neither large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play\nover time, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u91cd\u590d\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u4e3aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u603b\u7ed3\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3001\u540e\u6094\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u4ed6\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u4f7fLLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5747\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u884c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5747\u8861\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002"}}

As time progresses, concept drift occurs and\npreviously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in\nthe accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter\nupdating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss\nof some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of\nknowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully\nutilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool\n(CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for\ndifferent concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test\nsample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we\nrefer to as the retrieval.

The voice can\nrun in real time with limited compute resources.

We explore how to adapt a\nrobot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices\nin various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy\nand high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate\nand makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an\nEnglish TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known\nlinguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used\na data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use\nduration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax\n(short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly\ninfluences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for\nMatcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels\nunchanged.

While DETR-like architectures offer a\npowerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent\nlimitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these\nchallenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally\nadvance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions.\nFirst, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the\nintegration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves\nthe stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization\nobjective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to\naddress the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which\nseverely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly\nintroduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and\nunlock substantial performance gains. Finally, we introduce a sophisticated\nself-distillation strategy, leveraging insights from later decoder layers to\nsynergistically improve query quality in earlier layers, thereby amplifying the\niterative refinement process. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that\nMonoVQD achieves superior performance on the challenging KITTI monocular\nbenchmark.

To facilitate MRG and\nPS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the\no2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context.\nLeveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning\nstrategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a\nmodel-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the\nproposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall\nresponse diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response\nquality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff08MRG\u548cPS\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6o2mDial\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u672a\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff08MRG\uff09\u548c\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\uff08PS\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165o2mDial\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u540e\uff0c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

How can an\nAI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for\naccurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS)\nfor 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The\naim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D\nreconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each\ncandidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural\nuncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network,\nnamed UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a\npredicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible\ncandidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many\nnatural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to\nlearn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the\nunderlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all\npreviously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate\nviewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these\nselected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the\nquality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.\nRemarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our\nmethod achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it\nsignificantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400\ntimes speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage\ncompared to baseline methods.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion\nreconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower\nreconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods\ndirectly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced\nby inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency\ndetail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a\nFrequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical\nimage diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific\nmid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to\nreconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our\nfrequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image\ndifficulty. Specifically, we analyze the reverse diffusion process, obtain the\nmid-frequency reconstruction error, and compute the structural similarity index\nscore between the reconstructed and original images.

However, in complex environments,\nthe number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical\nproperties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a\nsingle global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system\nidentification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant\naspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation\nof energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility\nfor any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable,\nparticularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model\nPredictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it\ncontext-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system\nidentification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed\ncontrol. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the\nfact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available.

However, text extraction from\nhistorical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2)\ntraining data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific\nmap styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene\nimages) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their\nflexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these\nmethods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting\nevery sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This\nis critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex\nbackgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a\nrough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for\nscanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel\nhyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around\nthe target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and\nrecognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn\nspatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across\ntext instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to\nautomatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text\nspotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+\noutperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical\nmaps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with\nSynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map\ncollection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.\nThe project is released at\nhttps://github.com/kartta-foundation/mapkurator-palette-doc.", "AI": {"tldr": "PALETTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u6587\u672c\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SynthMap+\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5730\u7406\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u548c\u6587\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5176\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "PALETTE\u5f15\u5165\u8d85\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SynthMap+\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "PALETTE\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e60,000\u591a\u5f20\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "PALETTE\u4e3a\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u652f\u6301\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently\nintegrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying\ncapabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring\nhydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater\nnavigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design\nprovides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater\ntasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring\nactivities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body,\nSurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the\ntarget water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this\nletter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial\nmovement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required\ncontrol laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform\nsurface gliding and gliding takeoff.

Directly\napplying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at\nspecific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that\ndeviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods\nprimarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites\nand ERA5 variables as a condition.

To address this limitation,\nwe can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its\ninversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more\nrealistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve\nthe accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we\npropose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a\nconditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary\nsatellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and\ntopographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5\nreanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional\ninputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source\ncross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between\nreanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates\natmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions.

The definitive article is available at\n  https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-025-07055-5", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have\nrevolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical\napplications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in\nechocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments.\nHowever, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and\nambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To\naddress these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise\ndiffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a\nunique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a\nmulti-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision.\nFurthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial\nintegrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously\nvalidated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It\nachieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively.\nThe proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram\nsegmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in\nother medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across\nvarious medical domains.

This paper introduces\nTargeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach.\nWe first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits\nstrong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its\nearly internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine\nsimilarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its\nfinal output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set).\nTLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a\ncontrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting\nembeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful\nbalance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused\nimages effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the\nfunctional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited\ncapacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer\nfrom insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused\nimage quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage\ndiffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In\nStage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet\ncaptures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents\nmultilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the\nsubsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input\ninto the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability.\nThree key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from\ndifferent modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a\nhybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness,\ncolor, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The\nexperimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the\nproposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation\nmetrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive\ndistribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and\nGuru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open\nmodels RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by\n7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We\nalso show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their\nbase models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining\ndata.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a\nPareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but\noffer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller\nwindows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and\nMistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining\nlength) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift\nthis Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains\neven in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic\nlimitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the\ndefined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated\nwith a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information\nfrom these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B\nscales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between\nperformance and efficiency.

This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains\ncritical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce\nSupervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that\ntreats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups\ntokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM\nusing a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard\ncross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging\ntoken groups and guides the model to better handle different group\ndistributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its\nefficiency.

However, deploying these models for\nreasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate\nlong-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast\ncollections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a\nfew hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient\nmechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively\nevaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically\ntarget scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA\nbenchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and\nnavigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past\ninteractions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents\ninvolves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions\nbased on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together\nrather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for\nlong-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates\nmemory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and\ncontextual awareness in an environment.

Training high-performance models for this\ntask typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution\nby iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby\nreducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the\nassumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to\ntarget classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often\ncontains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low\nefficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing\nAL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a\nsignificant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these\nchallenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for\npathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language\nModel (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine\ntarget and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select\nIn-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In\nsubsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes\nPrototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic\nSampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a\nquery, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public\npathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's\nperformance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several\nstate-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model\nreliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.\nTo understand this mechanism, we need to first identify regret expressions in\nmodel outputs, then analyze their internal representation. This analysis\nrequires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing\noccurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the\nabsence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of\nmetrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of\nmetrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these\nlimitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret\ndataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised\nCompression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret\nrepresentation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to\nidentify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze\nactivation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the\noptimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly\nenhanced performance in probe classification experiments.

To address this issue,\nwe propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high\nmodel accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and\nresilience to Byzantine attacks.

Data-Free\nImage Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned\ndata distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data.\nHowever, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training\ndata distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To\novercome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted\nData-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model\nas a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts\nknowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to\nguide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately\nalign with the training data distribution.

To enhance the quality of generated 4D\nHOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to\nextract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention\nto effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.\nExperimental results show that we achieve state-of-the-art results on the\npublicly available OMOMO and 3D-FUTURE datasets, demonstrating strong\ngeneralization abilities to unseen objects, while enabling high-fidelity 4D HOI\ngeneration.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenHOI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f4D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a214D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76844D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528Object-AnchorNet\u4ece3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7a00\u758f3D\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7Contact-Aware Diffusion Model\uff08ContactDM\uff09\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c64D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165Contact-Aware Encoder\u548cHOI Attention\u3002", "result": "\u5728OMOMO\u548c3D-FUTURE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GenHOI\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D\u4eba-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to\nbe absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's\ndistribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in\npractice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address\nthis challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set.

Extensive experiments on\ndiverse text datasets show that using our generated data as a held-out set\nenables DI to detect the original training sets with high confidence, while\nmaintaining a low false positive rate.

Whereas\nmost prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide\nand national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense\nmetropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural\ncorridors.\n  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented,\nAdaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework\nthat unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises\nheterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines)\nonto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a\nzone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi\ntessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within\nevery 30 km radius.

We\nbuilt FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and\nfine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)\nand survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on\n749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of\ncancer patients.

Quantitative Structural\nModel (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree\nstructural reconstruction.

This study presents a novel unified framework that enables\nend-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative\ngraph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree\nsegmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through\ndedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology\nreasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf\nconditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and\ndata sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results\ndemonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in\nleaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with\npartial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the\nproposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,\nnon-destructive AGB estimation.

Drawing on international news\narticles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n(Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol\ninsurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we\nconstruct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving\ndiscourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram\nvia a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and\npersistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic\ndisruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major\ngeopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected\ncomponents) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative\nstructure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag\npattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order\nmotif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An\nexception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads\nH0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse\nadjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse\nnarrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a\nmathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points\nand directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge\nof specific events.

We argue that the key lies in how to\neffectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the\nlow-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining\nthe extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA\nLearning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion\nmodel, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency\nsimultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module\nto aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a\nConsistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from\ndegraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules\nand train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with\nthe temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases\nalternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent\nand detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged\ninto the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a\nsingle diffusion step.

The advantage of these\nmethods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise\nunattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based\nsolutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from\ndiffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting\nfactors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the\napproximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains\nunclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We\naddress the issue by employing a Schr\\\"odinger Bridge that interpolates between\nthe distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate\nthe learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we\nextend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge\n($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional\nImage-to-Image Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework. To\nvalidate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the\nreference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the\nobserved seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion\nmodel suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function\nevaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with\nsupervised learning-based approach.

Furthermore, our framework naturally extends\nto a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,\nwithout requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.\nExperiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset\ndemonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for\nPET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling\nhighly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

This raises questions about the alignment of this\nlanguage model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new\npractices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of\nhuman subjects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u591a\u9009\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f2\u76ee\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u6784\u5efa\u5b9a\u91cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e89\u8bae\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6536\u5165\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We\nconsider the problem of accurately estimating coefficients for interaction\nterms in linear predictors. We hypothesize that the coefficients for different\ninteraction terms have an approximate low-dimensional structure and represent\neach feature by a latent vector in a low-dimensional space. This\nlow-dimensional representation can be viewed as a structured regularization\napproach that further mitigates overfitting in high-dimensional settings beyond\nstandard regularizers such as the lasso and elastic net. We demonstrate that\nour approach, called LIT-LVM, achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to\nelastic net and factorization machines on a wide variety of simulated and real\ndata, particularly when the number of interaction terms is high compared to the\nnumber of samples.

Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent\nadvancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of\napplying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots.

In the context of\nWhole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,\nincluding heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical\ninstitutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn\nand transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates\nsynthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all\ncentres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to\nhistopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the\ndistillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic\nslides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted\nto the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined\nwith original slides for local tasks.

They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures\nassociated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections\ncaused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,\nthe limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,\nrequiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.\nIn high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a\nconstrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture\ndetails in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain\nis required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog\nsignal transmission introduce additional noise sources.

We\nempirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the\nMetropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference\nmechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention\nnaming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based,\nalways-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that\nhuman-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization\naccuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared\nsign system.

Trained across five calcium\nimaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors.\nAfter pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal\nfine-tuning.

The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use\ncheckpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an\nadditional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield\nsignificant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases\nand scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose,\nCheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by\na weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state\nof the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However,\nbecause of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover\nfailures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+\nwith out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last\nstages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is\nmimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by\nsimply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover\nthe (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring\nstages, which requires relatively small storage overhead. We extensively\nevaluate our method on LLaMa models of model sizes from 124M to 1.5B with\nvarying failure frequencies. In the case of low and medium failure rates\n(5-10%), CheckFree and CheckFree+ outperform both checkpointing and redundant\ncomputation in terms of convergence in wall-clock time by over 12%.

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

Supervised ViTs\nare competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO\n(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\\approx0.47$ at\nblock14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and\nrepresentational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on\nalignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating\narchitectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate\nthat self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational\ngeometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely\nused CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific\nhypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge.

Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on\nCostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently\nfail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5\nachieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance\nfurther dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions.

Furthermore, we\nintroduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the\nextraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing\nsubject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution.

To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing\nClaude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on\nrendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual\nrepresentation.

Classical deep generative models often struggle to\ncapture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or\nproducing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the\nQuantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework\nthat integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.\nThe framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that\njointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)\nquantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and\nmitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical\nparameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are\noptimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic\nGaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and\nprotein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by\nup to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),\nwhile improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration.

Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which\nis restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of\ncomputational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication\nsystems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local\ninformation processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp\nis currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous\ndata-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is\nsusceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of\nthe ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with\nmultiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector\nfunction computation but also ensures scalability in the computational\ncomplexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,\nVecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel\nimpairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric\napplications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared\nerror of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel\nconditions.

In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM\narchitecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound\nrecordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the\nH-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.\nExtensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a\npublic benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed\nmodel achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a\ntest accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%."}

Invited paper, submitted to the EURASIP Journal\n  on Wireless Communications and Networking (JWCN)", "summary": "This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework\nfor massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems\nemploying a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing\nperformance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance\ncharacteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection\nunder non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive\nestimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on\nthe RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is\nformulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication\nthroughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between\ndetection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived\nclosed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed\ncognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability\ncompared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining\ncompetitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of\nRL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation\nwireless networks."}

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our proposed methods lead to significant storage\nefficiency and superior accuracy within the same memory budget compared to\nemploying the low-rank approximation or sparsification individually."}

We introduce a novel subset selection algorithm applicable to\ngeneral kernel discrepancies to efficiently generate low-discrepancy samples\nfrom both the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube, the traditional\nsetting of classical QMC, and from more general distributions $F$ with known\ndensity functions by employing the kernel Stein discrepancy.

This enables quantitative \"what-if\"\nforecasting beyond large language models (LLMs) as the primary modeling\nprimitive. Actions such as physical resource blocks (PRBs) are treated as\nfirst-class control inputs in a causal world model, and both aleatoric and\nepistemic uncertainty are modeled for prediction and what-if analysis. An\nagentic, model predictive control (MPC)-based cross-entropy method (CEM)\nplanner operates over short horizons, using prior-mean rollouts within\ndata-driven PRB bounds to maximize a deterministic reward. The model couples\nmulti-scale structured state-space mixtures (MS3M) with a compact stochastic\nlatent to form WM-MS3M, summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs) histories\nand predicting next-step KPIs under hypothetical PRB sequences. On realistic\nO-RAN traces, WM-MS3M cuts mean absolute error (MAE) by 1.69% versus MS3M with\n32% fewer parameters and similar latency, and achieves 35-80% lower root mean\nsquared error (RMSE) than attention/hybrid baselines with 2.3-4.1x faster\ninference, enabling rare-event simulation and offline policy screening."}

Yet,\ndeveloping effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to\nheterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple\nscales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN\nand TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to\ngradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,\ncurrent architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature\nprocessing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with\nquadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component\nprocessing that prevents iterative representation refinement and\ncross-component communication.

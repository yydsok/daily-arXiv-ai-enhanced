The system\narchitecture encompasses agent-specific tool integration, asynchronous\ncommunication patterns, and comprehensive configuration management through\nGit-based tracking. Our production deployment strategy utilizes Kubernetes\ncontainer orchestration with Helm charts, Docker containerization, and CI/CD\npipelines for automated testing and deployment. The implementation integrates\nvector databases for RAG functionality and employs an Envoy reverse proxy for\nsecure external access.

Motivated by the\nrecognition that, in fluid mechanics, an understanding of the underlying flow\nphysics is as crucial as accurate prediction, this study applies SR to model a\nfundamental three-dimensional (3D) incompressible flow in a rectangular\nchannel, focusing on the (axial) velocity and pressure fields under laminar\nconditions. By employing the PySR library, compact symbolic equations were\nderived directly from numerical simulation data, revealing key characteristics\nof the flow dynamics. These equations not only approximate the parabolic\nvelocity profile and pressure drop observed in the studied fluid flow, but also\nperfectly coincide with analytical solutions from the literature. Furthermore,\nwe propose an innovative approach that integrates SR with the\nknowledge-representation framework of Answer Set Programming (ASP), combining\nthe generative power of SR with the declarative reasoning strengths of ASP.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, the\nresulting facial animation models are prohibitively large and lend themselves\nonly to offline inference on a dedicated machine. In this work, we explore\non-device, real-time facial animation models in the context of game\ndevelopment. We overcome the lack of large datasets by using hybrid knowledge\ndistillation with pseudo-labeling. Given a large audio dataset, we employ a\nhigh-performing teacher model to train very small student models. In contrast\nto the pre-trained speech encoders, our student models only consist of\nconvolutional and fully-connected layers, removing the need for attention\ncontext or recurrent updates. In our experiments, we demonstrate that we can\nreduce the memory footprint to up to 3.4 MB and required future audio context\nto up to 81 ms while maintaining high-quality animations.

Current approaches struggle to capture the nuanced biomechanical\ntransitions essential for meaningful sports analysis, often missing critical\nphases like preparation, execution, and follow-through that occur within\nseconds. To address these limitations, we introduce SV3.3B, a lightweight 3.3B\nparameter video understanding model that combines novel temporal motion\ndifference sampling with self-supervised learning for efficient on-device\ndeployment. Our approach employs a DWT-VGG16-LDA based keyframe extraction\nmechanism that intelligently identifies the 16 most representative frames from\nsports sequences, followed by a V-DWT-JEPA2 encoder pretrained through\nmask-denoising objectives and an LLM decoder fine-tuned for sports action\ndescription generation. Evaluated on a subset of the NSVA basketball dataset,\nSV3.3B achieves superior performance across both traditional text generation\nmetrics and sports-specific evaluation criteria, outperforming larger\nclosed-source models including GPT-4o variants while maintaining significantly\nlower computational requirements. Our model demonstrates exceptional capability\nin generating technically detailed and analytically rich sports descriptions,\nachieving 29.2% improvement over GPT-4o in ground truth validation metrics,\nwith substantial improvements in information density, action complexity, and\nmeasurement precision metrics essential for comprehensive athletic analysis.\nModel Available at https://huggingface.co/sportsvision/SV3.3B.", "AI": {"tldr": "SV3.3B\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u76843.3B\u53c2\u6570\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u5dee\u5f02\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGPT-4o\u7b49\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u5907\u3001\u6267\u884c\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408DWT-VGG16-LDA\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u3001V-DWT-JEPA2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLLM\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a9\u7801\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728NSVA\u7bee\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSV3.3B\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f53\u80b2\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SV3.3B\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4f4e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities.

An alternative derivation of the CI algorithm based on least\nsquares estimation makes this integration possible. We particularise the\nproposed approach to the robot-landmark localization problem. In this problem,\nnoisy measurements of the bearing angle to a stationary landmark position\nmeasured relative to the SE(2) pose of a moving robot couple the estimation\nproblems for the robot pose and the landmark position. In a randomized\nsimulation study, we benchmark the proposed modular method against a monolithic\njoint state filter to elucidate their respective trade-offs.

The ROS2 environment utilizes the\nYOLOv11 and YOLOv11-pose CNNs for tracking purposes, and the dlib library CNN\nfor face recognition. The system detects a specific individual, performs face\nrecognition and starts tracking. If the individual is not yet known, the UAV\noperator can manually locate the person, save their facial image and\nimmediately initiate the tracking process. The tracking process relies on\nspecific keypoints identified on the human body using the YOLOv11-pose CNN\nmodel. These keypoints are used to track a specific individual and maintain a\nsafe distance. To enhance accurate tracking, system identification is\nperformed, based on measurement data from the UAVs IMU. The identified system\nparameters are used to design PD controllers that utilize YOLOv11-pose to\nestimate the distance between the UAVs camera and the identified individual.\nThe initial experiments, conducted on 14 known individuals, demonstrated that\nthe proposed subsystem can be successfully used in real time.

To address this, Restormer employs channel-wise self-attention, which\ncomputes attention across channels instead of spatial dimensions.

To bridge this gap, we explore Dilated\nNeighborhood Attention (DiNA) as a promising alternative, inspired by its\nsuccess in high-level vision tasks.

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting.

Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset.

To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance.

Existing UDA-SS methods often struggle to balance fine-grained\nlocal details with global contextual information, leading to segmentation\nerrors in complex regions. To address this, we introduce the Adaptive Feature\nRefinement (AFR) module, which enhances segmentation accuracy by refining\nhighresolution features using semantic priors from low-resolution logits. AFR\nalso integrates high-frequency components, which capture fine-grained\nstructures and provide crucial boundary information, improving object\ndelineation. Additionally, AFR adaptively balances local and global information\nthrough uncertaintydriven attention, reducing misclassifications. Its\nlightweight design allows seamless integration into HRDA-based UDA methods,\nleading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance.

From this analysis it emerges that: 1)\nMost participants use end-to-end (e2e) ASR systems, whereas hybrid systems were\nprevalent in previous CHiME challenges. This transition is mainly due to the\navailability of robust large-scale pre-trained models, which lowers the data\nburden for e2e-ASR. 2) Despite recent advances in neural speech separation and\nenhancement (SSE), all teams still heavily rely on guided source separation,\nsuggesting that current neural SSE techniques are still unable to reliably deal\nwith complex scenarios and different recording setups. 3) All best systems\nemploy diarization refinement via target-speaker diarization techniques.\nAccurate speaker counting in the first diarization pass is thus crucial to\navoid compounding errors and CHiME-8 DASR participants especially focused on\nthis part. 4) Downstream evaluation via meeting summarization can correlate\nweakly with transcription quality due to the remarkable effectiveness of\nlarge-language models in handling errors.

The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe\nalgorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a\nrobotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and\nthe phantom remain in a fixed position.

Although speculative decoding has\nbeen explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key\ncharacteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce\nthe real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative\ndecoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed\nbased on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which\nresults in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given\noutput mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features\nan adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the\ndraft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further\nproposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously\ngenerated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a\ntwo-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the\nlatency of draft and target ASR models.

Code: https://github.com/duykhuongnguyen/GrAInS", "summary": "Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to\nfine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by\nmodifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.\nHowever, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,\noverlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage\ninformative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal\nsettings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "GrAInS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5e72\u9884\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002GrAInS\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "GrAInS\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\uff08Integrated Gradients\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u9690\u85cf\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "GrAInS\u5728TruthfulQA\u4e0a\u63d0\u534713.22%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728MMHal-Bench\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SPA-VL\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u80dc\u73878.11%\u3002", "conclusion": "GrAInS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This effectively models the local surface as a 2D Gaussian disk\naligned with the underlying geometry, leading to more consistent depth\ninterpretation across multiple viewpoints compared to conventional 3D\nellipsoid-based representations with isotropic uncertainty. To integrate this\nrepresentation into the SLAM pipeline, we embed the surface-aligned Gaussian\ndisks into a Generalized ICP framework by introducing anisotropic covariance\nprior without altering the underlying registration formulation.

Within this\nframework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline\npolicy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to\nadaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is\nvalidated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating\nsuperior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure\nforce-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned\npolicy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability\nprofiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code\nof ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARBoids\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eBoids\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u8247\u62e6\u622a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u8247\u62e6\u622a\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eBoids\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u62e6\u622a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "ARBoids\u6846\u67b6\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u62e6\u622a\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Our evaluation framework\nincorporates both lexical similarity and an LLM-as-a-judge approach, extended\nto better reflect clinical relevance. We assessed performance across key\ndimensions: question comprehension, reasoning, knowledge recall, bias,\npotential harm, and factual accuracy. Results show that Gemini 2.5 Pro\nconsistently outperformed other models across most dimensions. Notably, two of\nthe top three models were proprietary. Performance declined as question\ncomplexity increased. Medically fine-tuned models did not always outperform\ngeneral-purpose ones, and larger model size was not a reliable predictor of\nperformance. Reasoning and comprehension were more challenging than factual\nrecall, and cognitive biases such as recency and status quo were observed.\nThese findings underscore the need for targeted development and evaluation to\nensure safe, effective LLM integration in clinical care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728HIV\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86HIVMedQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Gemini 2.5 Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u533b\u5b66\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "HIV\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3aLLMs\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u5371\u5bb3\u548c\u533b\u751f\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86HIVMedQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e867\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c3\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u7528LLMs\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bcd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "Gemini 2.5 Pro\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u95ee\u9898\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u533b\u5b66\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5fc5\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6bd4\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u786e\u4fddLLMs\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

For example, measuring the response time (of a human\ndriver or ADS) to a conflict requires the determination of a stimulus onset and\na response onset. In existing studies, response onset relies on manual\nannotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal\nmovements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data\nwhere vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for\nthe rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding\nroad users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques\nfor ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are\nnot available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a\npiecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that\ncan be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal\ntime series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake\nonset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence\nmetric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification\nperformance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both\nADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.\nAlthough our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,\ngeneralizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly\nconfigurable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u8f66\u8f86\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u6216\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ADS\uff09\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528R2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5239\u8f66\u8d77\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet existing methods face key\nlimitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep\nlearning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial\nstructure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points\nof Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their\nutility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep\nlearning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow\npredictions by treating each POI as an individual node.

However, existing studies face three\nmajor limitations: (1) treating the task as unimodal categorization, which\nfails to leverage multimodal cues and fine-grained quality distinctions; (2)\nintroducing noise during deep multimodal fusion, leading to misleading signals;\nand (3) lacking the ability to capture complex semantic relationships like\nrelevance and comprehensiveness.

Stimulus features were extracted using pretrained models including\nVideoMAE, HuBERT, Qwen, and BridgeTower.

One core innovation of our approach is the use\nof sequences of multimodal context to predict sequences of brain activity,\nenabling the model to capture long-range temporal structure in both stimuli and\nneural responses. Another is the combination of a shared encoder with partial\nsubject-specific decoder, which leverages common structure across subjects\nwhile accounting for individual variability.

Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93.

While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation\nscenarios.

In this paper, we identify a previously unexplored attack vector\nagainst LRMs, which we term \"overthinking backdoors\".

Our attack is implemented through a novel data poisoning\nmethodology. It pairs a tunable trigger-where the number of repetitions signals\nthe desired intensity-with a correspondingly verbose CoT response.

The approach preserves output correctness, which ensures stealth and\nestablishes the attack as a pure resource-consumption vector. Extensive\nempirical results on various LRMs demonstrate that our method can reliably\ntrigger a controllable, multi-fold increase in the length of the reasoning\nprocess, without degrading the final answer's correctness.

GINs were found to consistently outperform GCNs and GATs, for\nthe top 5 of 7 most data-abundant toxicological assays. GATs however\nsignificantly outperformed over the remaining 2 most data-scarce assays. This\nindicates that GINs are a more optimal architecture for data-abundant\nenvironments, whereas GATs are a more optimal architecture for data-scarce\nenvironments. Subsequent analysis of the explored higher-dimensional\nhyperparameter spaces, as well as optimised hyperparameter states, found that\nGCNs and GATs reached measurably closer optimised states with each other,\ncompared to GINs, further indicating the unique nature of GINs as a GNN\nalgorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GCNs\u3001GATs\u3001GINs\uff09\u57287\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd2\u6027\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0GINs\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u800cGATs\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6bd2\u6027\u6d4b\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u8861\u5e76\u5206\u5c42\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cdGNN\u5728\u6bcf\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u517121\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83AUC\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "GINs\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6bd2\u6027\u6d4b\u5b9a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff08AUC 0.728-0.849\uff09\uff0cGATs\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "GINs\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0cGATs\u9002\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0cGINs\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation\nRobustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a\nrefined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization\non activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that\npreserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate\ncumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2\nshow that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit\nweight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six\nzero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.\nOur code will be released upon publication.", "AI": {"tldr": "Squeeze10-LLM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c0616\u4f4dLLM\u6743\u91cd\u538b\u7f2910\u500d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u6743\u91cd1.6\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u56e0\u53c2\u6570\u5e9e\u5927\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c80%\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a1\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c20%\u4e3a4\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165PBAR\u548cFIAS\u4e24\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA\u548cLLaMA2\u4e0a\uff0cSqueeze10-LLM\u57286\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece43%\u63d0\u5347\u81f356%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Squeeze10-LLM\u5728\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Moreover, we demonstrate that the additional supervision and the\nmixing coefficient contribute to the refinement of soft labels in complementary\nroles. Intuitively, in the probability simplex, the additional supervision\ndetermines the direction in which the deterministic distribution representing\nthe hard label should be adjusted toward the true label distribution, while the\nmixing coefficient controls the step size along that direction.

However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when\ncombined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high\ninference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\\textbf{Te}xt\n\\textbf{E}mbeddings \\textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method\nthat directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and\ndistills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing\nconditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,\nTeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,\nsimultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output\nproduced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on\nstate-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the\nstudent to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more\nefficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference\nspeeds up to 6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image\nquality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex\nsampling approach.

This\ntrend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying\nthe nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of\nGenerative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)\nhave become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,\nthe SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails\nto generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial\ndomains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the\nnuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,\nthe first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human\npreference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

This paper aims to\nconduct a systematic review on generating synthetic medical free-text by\nformulating quantitative analysis to three research questions concerning (i)\nthe purpose of generation, (ii) the techniques, and (iii) the evaluation\nmethods. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE,\nGoogle Scholar, and arXiv databases for publications associated with generating\nsynthetic medical unstructured free-text. We have identified 94 relevant\narticles out of 1,398 collected ones. A great deal of attention has been given\nto the generation of synthetic medical text from 2018 onwards, where the main\npurpose of such a generation is towards text augmentation, assistive writing,\ncorpus building, privacy-preserving, annotation, and usefulness. Transformer\narchitectures were the main predominant technique used to generate the text,\nespecially the GPTs. On the other hand, there were four main aspects of\nevaluation, including similarity, privacy, structure, and utility, where\nutility was the most frequent method used to assess the generated synthetic\nmedical text.

A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which\nis a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not\ntrivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study\nproposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a\ncombination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy\nof the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized.\nThe SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the\ninner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear\ncombination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the\nbasis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term\n(RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the\noptimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model\nhas good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the\nparsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces\nuser burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting\nmodel compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the\none-step-ahead prediction accuracy.

To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for\nmore accurate climate impact understanding and assessments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5730\u9762\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u76f8\u673a\u5c3e\u8ff9\u5e8f\u5217\uff08GVCCS\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5c3e\u8ff9\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c3e\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u7a7a\u5c3e\u8ff9\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0eCO2\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u822a\u73ed\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762\u5168\u5929\u7a7a\u76f8\u673a\u8bb0\u5f55\u5c3e\u8ff9\uff0c\u6784\u5efaGVCCS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u5c3e\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "GVCCS\u5305\u542b122\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff0824,228\u5e27\uff09\uff0c\u6bcf\u6bb5\u5c3e\u8ff9\u5747\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8be6\u7ec6\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "GVCCS\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5c3e\u8ff9\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c14\u5019\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this work, we analyze a critical yet\noverlooked issue in this context: security regression.

Despite\nsubstantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic\n4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to\noptimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal\ndomain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances\ntemporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key\nchallenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior\n4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate\nthat MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and\ntime efficiency.

For ungauged basins, we infer the\nrequired BMA and RC weights by linking them to catchment attributes from gauged\nbasins, creating a generalizable framework. We evaluated HYPER using data from\n87 river basins in Japan. In a data-rich scenario, HYPER (median Kling-Gupta\nEfficiency, KGE, of 0.56) performed comparably to a benchmark LSTM (KGE 0.55)\nbut required only 5% of its computational time. In a data-scarce scenario (23%\nof basins gauged), HYPER maintained robust performance (KGE 0.55) and lower\nuncertainty, whereas the LSTM's performance degraded significantly (KGE -0.04).\nThese results reveal that individual conceptual hydrological models do not\nnecessarily need to be calibrated when an effectively large ensemble is\nassembled and combined with machine-learning-based bias correction.

This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained the most\nwidespread use in LM fine-tuning due to its lightweight computational cost and\nremarkable performance. Because the proportion of parameters tuned by LoRA is\nrelatively small, there might be a misleading impression that the LoRA\nfine-tuning data is invulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs).\nHowever, we identify that utilizing the pre-trained model can induce more\ninformation leakage, which is neglected by existing MIAs. Therefore, we\nintroduce LoRA-Leak, a holistic evaluation framework for MIAs against the\nfine-tuning datasets of LMs. LoRA-Leak incorporates fifteen membership\ninference attacks, including ten existing MIAs, and five improved MIAs that\nleverage the pre-trained model as a reference. In experiments, we apply\nLoRA-Leak to three advanced LMs across three popular natural language\nprocessing tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-based fine-tuned LMs are still\nvulnerable to MIAs (e.g., 0.775 AUC under conservative fine-tuning settings).\nWe also applied LoRA-Leak to different fine-tuning settings to understand the\nresulting privacy risks. We further explore four defenses and find that only\ndropout and excluding specific LM layers during fine-tuning effectively\nmitigate MIA risks while maintaining utility. We highlight that under the\n\"pre-training and fine-tuning\" paradigm, the existence of the pre-trained model\nmakes MIA a more severe risk for LoRA-based LMs. We hope that our findings can\nprovide guidance on data privacy protection for specialized LM providers.", "AI": {"tldr": "LoRA-Leak\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIAs\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRA-Leak\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u540815\u79cdMIAs\uff0810\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u548c5\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9MIAs\u4ecd\u8106\u5f31\uff08\u59820.775 AUC\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u5267\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u4ec5dropout\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5c42\u6392\u9664\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4f7fLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684MIA\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data.

In our experiments using the Shoes and Fashion IQ as the\noriginal datasets and three CRS models, we find that using the knowledge of\nalternatives by the simulator can have a considerable impact on the evaluation\nof existing CRS models, specifically that the existing single-target evaluation\nunderestimates their effectiveness, and when simulatedusers are allowed to\ninstead consider alternative relevant items, the system can rapidly respond to\nmore quickly satisfy the user.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6Fashion-AlterEval\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u5143\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u54c1\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u8010\u5fc3\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CRS\uff09\u7684\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u54c1\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u7528\u6237\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u8010\u5fc3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u589e\u6ce8\u91ca\u6784\u5efaFashion-AlterEval\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5143\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u8868\u8fbe\u5bf9\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3001\u6539\u53d8\u4e3b\u610f\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u8010\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u54c1\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdCRS\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u8003\u8651\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u54c1\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Fashion-AlterEval\u548c\u5143\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86CRS\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

These applications have diverse token-generation latency\nrequirements. As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction.

In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity\nshow a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75).

However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization\nframework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from\nconfidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering\nwith an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling\naccurate reconstruction and pose estimation.

To\naddress this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS\nmatching and registration.

This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a\nshared descriptor space.\n  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify\nanatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a\ncurriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to\nlearn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and\nlimited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant .

Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be\nused to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing\n- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide\nadditional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the\nmorph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the\nmorph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same\nmorph technique.

In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is\npresented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using\natomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a\nhigh-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like,\nand symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to\nexpose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently,\nunsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous\natoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with\nmultidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a\nminimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various\ntests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only\nthree order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels.\nBased on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as\nthe logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal\nthroughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance\n(AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient\non-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal\nC-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the\nhypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains\nrelevance later.

Additionally, we identify\na parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and\nRL's treatment of intertemporal costs.

To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive\ngeometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation\nStage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and\nflexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy\nand dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise\ndeformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,\nwe propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM\nfaces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive\nfacial motions.

Despite recent advances, these existing\nmethods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or\nalter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about\nwatermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of\nfine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a\nresult, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,\nwhich limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)\nsystems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a\nService (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in\nwhich we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark\ncan still be extracted from model outputs.

It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining\nthe so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN\narchitectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating\nthe fidelity-robustness trade-off. Extensive experiments on image-to-image,\nnoise-to-image, noise-and-text-to-image, and text-to-image models, demonstrate\nthe efficacy and practicality of ShadowMark for real-world deployment of\nnonintrusive DNN watermarking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684DNN\u6c34\u5370\u670d\u52a1\uff08NWaaS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ShadowMark\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DNN\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8c03\u4f18\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNWaaS\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ShadowMark\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2API\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u4fa7\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u94a5\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u6c34\u5370\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eShadowMark\u5728\u4e0d\u540cDNN\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u7edd\u5bf9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u62b5\u5fa1\u73b0\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ShadowMark\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0fDNN\u6c34\u5370\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, efficient inverse\nrendering with MVPS remains challenging. To fill this gap, we introduce the\nGaussian Splatting for Multi-view Photometric Stereo (PS-GS), which efficiently\nand jointly estimates the geometry, materials, and lighting of the object that\nis illuminated by diverse directional lights (multi-light). Our method first\nreconstructs a standard 2D Gaussian splatting model as the initial geometry.\nBased on the initialization model, it then proceeds with the deferred inverse\nrendering by the full rendering equation containing a lighting-computing\nmulti-layer perceptron. During the whole optimization, we regularize the\nrendered normal maps by the uncalibrated photometric stereo estimated normals.\nWe also propose the 2D Gaussian ray-tracing for single directional light to\nrefine the incident lighting.

The inherent randomness in\ndiffusion models helps address issues such as blurring at the edges of medical\nimages and labels, positioning Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) as a\npromising approach for lesion segmentation. However, we find that the current\ntraining and inference strategies of diffusion models result in an uneven\ndistribution of attention across different timesteps, leading to longer\ntraining times and suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose UniSegDiff, a\nnovel diffusion model framework designed to address lesion segmentation in a\nunified manner across multiple modalities and organs.

Recent advances demonstrate that inference on sparse\nBayesian networks can be accelerated using quantum rejection sampling combined\nwith amplitude amplification, leading to a computational speedup in estimating\nacceptance probabilities.\\\\ Building on this result, we introduce Quantum\nBayesian Reinforcement Learning (QBRL), a hybrid quantum-classical look-ahead\nalgorithm for model-based RL in partially observable environments. We present a\nrigorous, oracle-free time complexity analysis under fault-tolerant assumptions\nfor the quantum device.

Investigating the topological structures of LLM embedding spaces via\nmapper graphs enables us to understand their underlying structures.\nSpecifically, a mapper graph summarizes the topological structure of the\nembedding space, where each node represents a topological neighborhood\n(containing a cluster of embeddings), and an edge connects two nodes if their\ncorresponding neighborhoods overlap. However, manually exploring these\nembedding spaces to uncover encoded linguistic properties requires considerable\nhuman effort. To address this challenge, we introduce a framework for\nsemi-automatic annotation of these embedding properties. To organize the\nexploration process, we first define a taxonomy of explorable elements within a\nmapper graph such as nodes, edges, paths, components, and trajectories. The\nannotation of these elements is executed through two types of customizable\nLLM-based agents that employ perturbation techniques for scalable and automated\nanalysis. These agents help to explore and explain the characteristics of\nmapper elements and verify the robustness of the generated explanations.

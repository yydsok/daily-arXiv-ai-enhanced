However, existing methods\nmainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality\nentanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap,\nwe introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to\ncontinuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive\nanalysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic\ndrift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks;\n2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be\nconfused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework\nis designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic\ndrift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select\nsamples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence\nconfusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed,\nallowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable\nclasses during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual\nincremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method.

This\npaper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable\nepistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI\nresearch asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what\nconditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of\nmind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and\nimplementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and\nextended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a\nperformed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,\nand regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes\nphilosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling\n\"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it\nshows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more\ncoherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,\nsupported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not\nrepresentational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic\nstate through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of\nmind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to\nbe enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure\nrather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not\nas truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a\nphenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive\nphenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real\nprogress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive\nprinciples structurally."}

The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings.

However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply\nkernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern\nrecognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing\nthis neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow\nincreased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a\nConvolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a\nphysical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to\ndetermine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was\ntrained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as\nwell as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of\nrandomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was\nchosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test\ndata set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the\nbasis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture\ndetailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to\nfacilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of\nincreasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic\nscale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts."}

Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and\nscalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task\nand cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both\nshared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its\nreasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after\nfinetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and\npath-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in\nPhi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.\nTogether, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by\na compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer\ncross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens\nalgorithmic generalization across domains."}

To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin.

For example, \"summer is approaching\" parallels \"We\nare approaching the summer\". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of\nreference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.\nExtending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines\nhow temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of\n\"now\". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in\nnatural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about\ntime remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding\nunder Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event\nand event-event relations when the reference point of \"now\" dynamically shifts\nalong a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition\n\\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the\ncurrent moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00\n(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment\nbetween the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit\nmeasurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking\naround the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The\nadaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while\nLLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning\nremains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance."}

In this paper, we study the central question of how to design\nexploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in\nLLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that\naugments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on\nthe idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin\nFlipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic\nuncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic\nreward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task\nrewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs\neither require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or\ninject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In\nthis work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that\ninjects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial\nfoundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and\nincludes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for\nhigher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To\npreserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced\nAction Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.\nThese designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation,\nmodality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across\nthree simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive\nbaselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and\nvariations in object scale and height."}

Building on\nthese insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,\nturn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level\nGeneral Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.\nThrough this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a\nscore of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\\times$\nimprovement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary\nreasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5\n(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable\nsystem for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual\nenvironments.

This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

We\nshow that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --\nadditive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied\nto the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.\nBuilding on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than\nassigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base\nform and transformation vectors (e.g., \"walked\" = \"walk\" + past tense). We\napply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to\n10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more\ndiverse tokens.

Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2\ndiabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely\ninterventions.

We compared behavioral and neural\nresponses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established\nERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing\ncognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results\ndemonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward\nAI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to\ndeliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI\nthan human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as\ncomputational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis\nconsistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people\nwho perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for\nAI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated\nby specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that\nsource attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.\nDespite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social\nagency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how\nhumans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents."}

Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize\nsimplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing\ncross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models\ndominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the\nMamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a\npromising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel\nX-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks\nusing parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into\npatches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature\nextraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a\nhybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and\nachieving strong results on benchmark datasets.

To address this, this paper systematically reviews the\ntechnologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on\nLLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the\nevolution of agents in industry applications, from \"process execution systems\"\nto \"adaptive social systems.\" First, we examine the three key technological\npillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,\nand Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple\ntasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and\ncollective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of\nthe application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital\nengineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative\nbusiness execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper\nreviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and\nspecialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation\nsystems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,\nwe focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their\ncapability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in\nvarious scenarios, while providing insights into future directions.

While recent verification-refinement\nframeworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,\ntheir effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction\ncapabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This\nwork demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities\non hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially\nextended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning\n(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step\nrepresents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is\nthat convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability\nof improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple\nlong-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small\npositive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct\nanswers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model.

In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step\nassociated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.\nWe show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms\noffline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop\nBayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting\nknowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits\nBayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency\nmatrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step\nprogress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over\nstate-of-the-art training-based offline methods."}

We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to\ndata-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements\non data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this\nend, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method\nand naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the\ninner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget\non some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data\nselection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in\naddressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:\nthe expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the\ncomputational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To\nsolve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy\nand compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To\naddress the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into\na penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to\nestimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,\nsignificantly improving efficiency.

Further, semantic information plays a\ncrucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by\nexisting E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V\nframework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality\nand leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,\nSemantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to\ntransfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation\nmodel, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning\nthe high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned\nsemantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)\nblock to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event\nrepresentations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.\nFurther, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a\nnovel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct\nsemantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels.

Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between\nthe observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query,\nwe show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least\n$\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak\nrate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest\nincrease in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic\nin terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across\nsystem-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the\ntheory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding\nlogits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process\ntrims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for\nbalancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs."}

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive\nexperiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and\ncounterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:\nhttps://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL."}

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a\nset $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t\n\\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction.

To address\nthis challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based\nmulti-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep\nresearch for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent\nemploys a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate\ntargeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various\ndata sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either\ngrounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering\ntransparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care\nrisk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine\nclinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data\nanalysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and\nexpand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a\nuser's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic\nadherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over\n10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more\nthan 50%.

To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a\nlightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously\nadjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a\nclosed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,\nprivacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),\nlocal privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on\nenvironmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances\nprivacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to\nadaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a\ndynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative\nrisk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead\ndeployment.

Prior work often either selects a pretrained policy based on\nan inferred model of the new teammates or pretrains a single policy that is\nrobust to potential teammates. Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained\npolicies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad\nhoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two\nkey ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient\nand effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically\ndemonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc\nTeaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three\nsimulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked.

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a\nlatent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct\nimages. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the\ngenerative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of\nvisual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and\nrelationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that\nProjects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate\nrepresentation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric\ndiffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to\nreduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module\nthat automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align\nwith the neural activity.

Extensive experiments on image and tabular\nbenchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for\nOOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely\nabsent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary\nOOD detection to a more granular detection."}

The\nproposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction\nframework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks.

Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval\napproaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and\ncomposition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete\ncapability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component\nselection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and\nreal-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,\nautomated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the\nknapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically\nidentify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly\nconsidering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility.

This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording."}

To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic\nAggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for\nmotion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding\nattention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the\nRegion-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the\noptimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic\nExcitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions\ncontaining more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static\nregions that are more susceptible to covariates.

Despite its\nsuccesses, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid\nsearching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number\nof prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer\nfindings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by\nits absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention\ninterplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating\ninstance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the\nprompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we\nfind an interesting phenomenon, namely \"attention anchor\", that incorporating\ninstance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully\npreserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more\nactive attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our\nobservation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and\neffective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics\ninto prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both\ninstance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner\n(i.e., one single capsule prompt).

A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a\nprimary thematic category for each article based on its abstract.

Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning\nmethods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer\nclassification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical\nadoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification,\ndistinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a\nnovel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved\nmulti-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT\nimages.

Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the\nLC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200\nimages, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images.\nThrough the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and\nmeticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was\nrecorded.

This has created a void in the\nunderstanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive\nimages. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our\nfindings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,\nPreference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT).

A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to\navoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's\nreasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We\ninvestigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in\nsystematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications\nfor violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond\nbeing an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated\nreasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges\ncan fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be\npersuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear\ninstructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more\nsophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for\nmonitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated\nreasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and\noversight. All code for this paper will be made available.

Experiments on\nsynthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show that ARCO-BO\nconsistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via\nconsensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex\nmulti-agent settings."}

Here, we propose MapMuse, a\nstorytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets,\ntransforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize\nlarge language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and\nagent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles\ncommon in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection,\nand audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi\ntrajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a\nheat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban\nmobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi\njourney, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying\nlocations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling\ndrives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information.

In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$\ngold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and\na ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points.\nWe introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented\nResidual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both\nestimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and\nPPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024),\nrespectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy\ncriterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate\nhow to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms\nexisting methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census\nreports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence,\nwhich is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine\nlearning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of\nPART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of\nPART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions\nin the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1}\n+ n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing\nmethods."}

Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on\ninstruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,\nhow far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we\nintroduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across\neight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for\nmost of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We\nfurther propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses\nVLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.\nBeyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics\nfrom videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K.

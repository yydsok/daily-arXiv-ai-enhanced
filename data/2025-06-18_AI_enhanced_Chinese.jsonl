However, the subjective moments of negative experience, where the conversation loses fluidity or enjoyment remain understudied. These moments are infrequent in naturalistic data, and thus training a supervised learning (SL) model requires costly manual data annotation. We applied semi-supervised learning (SSL) to leverage targeted labeled and unlabeled clips for training multimodal (audio, facial, text) deep features to predict non-fluid or unenjoyable moments in holdout videoconference sessions. The modality-fused co-training SSL achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.9 and an F1 score of 0.6, outperforming SL models by up to 4% with the same amount of labeled data. Remarkably, the best SSL model with just 8% labeled data matched 96% of the SL model's full-data performance.

This contribution introduces the Fretting-Transformer, an encoderdecoder model that utilizes a T5 transformer architecture to automate the transcription of MIDI sequences into guitar tablature. By framing the task as a symbolic translation problem, the model addresses key challenges, including string-fret ambiguity and physical playability. The proposed system leverages diverse datasets, including DadaGP, GuitarToday, and Leduc, with novel data pre-processing and tokenization strategies. We have developed metrics for tablature accuracy and playability to quantitatively evaluate the performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the Fretting-Transformer surpasses baseline methods like A* and commercial applications like Guitar Pro. The integration of context-sensitive processing and tuning/capo conditioning further enhances the model's performance, laying a robust foundation for future developments in automated guitar transcription.", "AI": {"tldr": "Fretting-Transformer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eT5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06MIDI\u5e8f\u5217\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5f55\u4e3a\u5409\u4ed6\u6307\u6cd5\u8c31\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f26-\u54c1\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6f14\u594f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5546\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "MIDI\u7b26\u53f7\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5409\u4ed6\u6f14\u594f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f26-\u54c1\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6f14\u594f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6c\u5f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528T5\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DadaGP\u3001GuitarToday\u548cLeduc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFretting-Transformer\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6f14\u594f\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eA*\u548cGuitar Pro\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5409\u4ed6\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u5f55\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8c03\u5f26/\u53d8\u8c03\u5939\u6761\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

It then reviews the core methodological pillars, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), generative models, and self-supervised multimodal learning frameworks. Furthermore, the survey details the significant applications of acoustic world models in robotics, autonomous driving, healthcare, and finance. Finally, it systematically outlines the important technical and ethical challenges while proposing a concrete roadmap for future research directions toward robust, causal, uncertainty-aware, and responsible acoustic intelligence. These elements collectively point to a research pathway towards embodied active acoustic intelligence, empowering AI systems to construct an internal \"intuitive physics\" engine through sound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7efc\u8ff0\u5168\u9762\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65b0\u5174\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u58f0\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u68b0\u6ce2\u80fd\u91cf\u8f7d\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PINNs\uff09\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u58f0\u5b66\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u58f0\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u58f0\u97f3\u7684\u201c\u76f4\u89c9\u7269\u7406\u201d\u5f15\u64ce\u3002"}}

Natural language processing technologies, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs), have been widely applied to climate change-specific research, providing essential information support for decision-makers and the public. Some studies have improved model performance on relevant tasks by constructing climate change-related instruction data and instruction-tuning LLMs. However, current research remains inadequate in efficiently producing large volumes of high-precision instruction data for climate change, which limits further development of climate change LLMs. This study introduces an automated method for constructing instruction data. The method generates instructions using facts and background knowledge from documents and enhances the diversity of the instruction data through web scraping and the collection of seed instructions. Using this method, we constructed a climate change instruction dataset, named ClimateChat-Corpus, which was used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, resulting in an LLM named ClimateChat. Evaluation results show that ClimateChat significantly improves performance on climate change question-and-answer tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of different base models and instruction data on LLM performance and demonstrated its capability to adapt to a wide range of climate change scientific discovery tasks, emphasizing the importance of selecting an appropriate base model for instruction tuning.

Policies relying on state estimations, like 6D pose, require task-specific tracking and are difficult to scale, while raw sensor-based policies may lack robustness to small visual disturbances.In this work, we leverage 2D keypoints - spatially consistent features in the image frame - as a flexible state representation for robust policy learning and apply it to both sim-to-real transfer and real-world imitation learning. However, the choice of which keypoints to use can vary across objects and tasks. We propose a novel method, ATK, to automatically select keypoints in a task-driven manner so that the chosen keypoints are predictive of optimal behavior for the given task. Our proposal optimizes for a minimal set of keypoints that focus on task-relevant parts while preserving policy performance and robustness. We distill expert data (either from an expert policy in simulation or a human expert) into a policy that operates on RGB images while tracking the selected keypoints. By leveraging pre-trained visual modules, our system effectively encodes states and transfers policies to the real-world evaluation scenario despite wide scene variations and perceptual challenges such as transparent objects, fine-grained tasks, and deformable objects manipulation. We validate ATK on various robotic tasks, demonstrating that these minimal keypoint representations significantly improve robustness to visual disturbances and environmental variations.

This framework is consistent with the principles of spatial computing and with the empirical findings in cognitive science about memory. Computations are performed through a process of multiplication-like binding and non-associative interference-like bundling. Models that rely on associative bundling typically lose order information, which necessitates the use of auxiliary order structures, such as position markers, to represent sequential information that is important for cognitive tasks. In contrast, the non-associative bundling proposed allows the construction of sparse representations of arbitrarily long sequences that maintain their temporal structure across arbitrary lengths. In this operation, noise is a constituent element of the representation of order information, rather than a means of obscuring it. The non-associative nature of the proposed framework results in the representation of a single sequence by two distinct states. The L-state, generated through left-associative bundling, continuously updates and emphasises a recency effect, while the R-state, formed through right-associative bundling, encodes finite sequences or chunks, capturing a primacy effect. The construction of these states may be associated with activity in the prefrontal cortex in relation to short-term memory and hippocampal encoding in long-term memory, respectively. The accuracy of retrieval is contingent upon a decision-making process that is based on the mutual information between the memory states and the cue. The model is able to replicate the Serial Position Curve, which reflects the empirical recency and primacy effects observed in cognitive experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee3\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u9879\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u8054\u6346\u7ed1\u4e22\u5931\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u8054\u6346\u7ed1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8f85\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ed3\u5408\u6346\u7ed1\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u6cd5\u7c7b\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u5408\u5e72\u6270\u7c7b\u6346\u7ed1\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u751f\u6210L\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5de6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u548cR\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u53f3\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4f4d\u7f6e\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ed3\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u548c\u6d77\u9a6c\u4f53\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u529f\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u3002"}}

For this purpose, we consider the Delaunay triangulation of template features as an useful tool through which to be guided in this iterative approach. The triangulation is treated as a graph and, starting from a single triangle, neighboring nodes are considered and the corresponding features are identified; then matches related to them are evaluated to determine if they are worthy to be grouped. This evaluation is based on local consistency criteria derived from geometric and photometric properties of local features. Our solution allows the identification of the object in situations where geometric models (e.g. homography) does not hold, thus enable the detection of objects such that the template is non planar or when it is planar but appears distorted in the image.

Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for stable quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW.

LLMs pre-trained on general corpora often hallucinate when handling personalized or unseen queries, leading to incorrect or outdated responses. Knowledge editing addresses this by identifying and adjusting a small crucial portion of model weights, without compromising the general knowledge. However, prior knowledge editing methods are impractical to run on local devices due to the resource-heavy backpropagation (BP) needed for updates. We present MobiEdit, the first mobile knowledge editing framework that enables efficient LLM personalization on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. MobiEdit replaces full-precision BP with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, thus compatible with the energy-efficient mobile neural processing units (NPUs). MobiEdit replaces full-precision backpropagation with quantized forward-only gradient estimation, making it compatible with energy-efficient mobile NPUs. To further improve gradient estimation efficiency, we introduce two optimizations: an early stoping mechanism that adaptively terminates editing upon success and a prefix cache that reuses computation across steps.

This paper tackles the challenge of downlink spatial reuse in Wi-Fi networks, specifically in scenarios involving overlapping basic service sets, by employing hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL). We decompose the CSR process into two phases, i.e., a polling phase and a decision phase, and introduce the HMARL algorithm to enable efficient CSR. To enhance training efficiency, the proposed HMARL algorithm employs a hierarchical structure, where station selection and power control are determined by a high- and low-level policy network, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that this approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in terms of throughput and latency across various network topologies.

The sounds of our lungs, heart, and voice convey vital information about our health. Yet, in contemporary medicine, these sounds are primarily analyzed through auditory interpretation by experts using devices like stethoscopes. Automated analysis offers the potential to standardize the processing of medical sounds, enable screening in low-resource settings where physicians are scarce, and detect subtle patterns that may elude human perception, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and treatment.\n  Focusing on the analysis of infant cry sounds to predict medical conditions, this thesis contributes on four key fronts. First, in low-data settings, we demonstrate that large databases of adult speech can be harnessed through neural transfer learning to develop more accurate and robust models for infant cry analysis. Second, in cost-effective modeling, we introduce an end-to-end model compression approach for recurrent networks using tensor decomposition. Our method requires no post-hoc processing, achieves compression rates of several hundred-fold, and delivers accurate, portable models suitable for resource-constrained devices. Third, we propose novel domain adaptation techniques tailored for audio models and adapt existing methods from computer vision. These approaches address dataset bias and enhance generalization across domains while maintaining strong performance on the original data. Finally, to advance research in this domain, we release a unique, open-source dataset of infant cry sounds, developed in collaboration with clinicians worldwide.\n  This work lays the foundation for recognizing the infant cry as a vital sign and highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven audio monitoring in shaping the future of accessible and affordable healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u9884\u6d4b\u533b\u7597\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u80ba\u90e8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u548c\u58f0\u97f3\uff09\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u542c\u89c9\u5206\u6790\u3002\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4eba\u7c7b\u96be\u4ee5\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u6210\u4eba\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u901a\u8fc7\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff1b4. \u53d1\u5e03\u5f00\u6e90\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u7684\u4fbf\u643a\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5c06\u5a74\u513f\u54ed\u58f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86AI\u97f3\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\u5728\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u53ca\u3001\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The Vision-Language Reward Model (VL-RM) is key to aligning VL models by providing structured feedback, yet training effective VL-RMs faces two major challenges. First, the bootstrapping dilemma arises as high-quality training data depends on already strong VL models, creating a cycle where self-generated supervision reinforces existing biases. Second, modality bias and negative example amplification occur when VL models hallucinate incorrect visual attributes, leading to flawed preference data that further misguides training. To address these issues, we propose an iterative training framework leveraging vision experts, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, and Margin-based Rejection Sampling.

Most common steering approaches, like goal-conditioning, require training the robot policy with a distribution of test-time objectives in mind. To overcome this limitation, we present DynaGuide, a steering method for diffusion policies using guidance from an external dynamics model during the diffusion denoising process. DynaGuide separates the dynamics model from the base policy, which gives it multiple advantages, including the ability to steer towards multiple objectives, enhance underrepresented base policy behaviors, and maintain robustness on low-quality objectives. The separate guidance signal also allows DynaGuide to work with off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion policies. We demonstrate the performance and features of DynaGuide against other steering approaches in a series of simulated and real experiments, showing an average steering success of 70% on a set of articulated CALVIN tasks and outperforming goal-conditioning by 5.4x when steered with low-quality objectives. We also successfully steer an off-the-shelf real robot policy to express preference for particular objects and even create novel behavior.

This paper introduces a novel solution: a 'superego' agent, designed as a personalized oversight mechanism for agentic AI. This system dynamically steers AI planning by referencing user-selected \"Creed Constitutions\"-encapsulating diverse rule sets-with adjustable adherence levels to fit non-negotiable values. A real-time compliance enforcer validates plans against these constitutions and a universal ethical floor before execution. We present a functional system, including a demonstration interface (www.Creed.Space) with a prototypical constitution-sharing portal, and successful integration with third-party models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations (HarmBench, AgentHarm) demonstrate that our Superego agent dramatically reduces harmful outputs, achieving up to a 98.3% harm score reduction and near-perfect refusal rates (e.g., 100% with Claude Sonnet 4 on AgentHarm's harmful set) for leading LLMs like Gemini 2.5 Flash and GPT-4o.

However, concerns persist around their potential to replicate and magnify existing societal biases. To investigate these issues, we curated a diverse set of prompts spanning thematic categories such as occupations, traits, actions, ideologies, emotions, family roles, place descriptions, spirituality, and life events. For each of the 160 unique topics, we crafted multiple prompt variations to reflect a wide range of meanings and perspectives. Using Stable Diffusion 1.5 (UNet-based) and Flux-1 (DiT-based) models with original checkpoints, we generated over 16,000 images under consistent settings. Additionally, we collected 8,000 comparison images from Google Image Search. All outputs were filtered to exclude abstract, distorted, or nonsensical results. Our analysis reveals significant disparities in the representation of gender, race, age, somatotype, and other human-centric factors across generated images. These disparities often mirror and reinforce harmful stereotypes embedded in societal narratives.

Traditional approaches use priority dispatching rules based on simple heuristics. Recent work has attempted to replace these with deep learning models, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), that learn to assign priorities from data. However, training such models requires customizing numerous factors: graph representation, node features, action space, and reward functions. The lack of modular libraries for experimentation makes this research time-consuming. This work introduces JobShopLib, a modular library that allows customizing these factors and creating new components with its reinforcement learning environment. We trained several dispatchers through imitation learning to demonstrate the environment's utility. One model outperformed various graph-based dispatchers using only individual operation features, highlighting the importance of feature customization. Our GNN model achieved near state-of-the-art results on large-scale problems. These results suggest significant room for improvement in developing such models.

We address these challenges by developing an emotional SDS for news conversations that utilizes a large language model (LLM)-based sentiment analyzer to identify appropriate emotions and PromptTTS to synthesize context-appropriate emotional speech. We also propose subjective evaluation scale for emotional SDSs and judge the emotion regulation performance of the proposed and baseline systems.

Human performance baselines are vital for the machine learning community, downstream users, and policymakers to interpret AI evaluations. Models are often claimed to achieve \"super-human\" performance, but existing baselining methods are neither sufficiently rigorous nor sufficiently well-documented to robustly measure and assess performance differences. Based on a meta-review of the measurement theory and AI evaluation literatures, we derive a framework with recommendations for designing, executing, and reporting human baselines. We synthesize our recommendations into a checklist that we use to systematically review 115 human baselines (studies) in foundation model evaluations and thus identify shortcomings in existing baselining methods; our checklist can also assist researchers in conducting human baselines and reporting results. We hope our work can advance more rigorous AI evaluation practices that can better serve both the research community and policymakers.

As large language models (LLMs) enter high-stakes domains like education, healthcare, governance, and law, their behavior must reliably reflect human-aligned values and safety constraints. Yet current evaluations rely heavily on behavioral proxies such as refusal rates, G-Eval scores, and toxicity classifiers, all of which have critical blind spots. Aligned models are often vulnerable to jailbreaking, stochasticity of generation, and alignment faking.\n  To address this issue, we introduce the Alignment Quality Index (AQI). This novel geometric and prompt-invariant metric empirically assesses LLM alignment by analyzing the separation of safe and unsafe activations in latent space. By combining measures such as the Davies-Bouldin Score (DBS), Dunn Index (DI), Xie-Beni Index (XBI), and Calinski-Harabasz Index (CHI) across various formulations, AQI captures clustering quality to detect hidden misalignments and jailbreak risks, even when outputs appear compliant.

A critical aspect in this context is the concept of personal space, a psychological boundary around an individual that influences their comfort based on proximity. This concept extends to human-robot interaction, where robots must respect personal space to avoid causing discomfort. While much research has focused on modeling personal space in two dimensions, almost none have considered the vertical dimension. In this work, we propose a novel three-dimensional personal space model that integrates both height (introducing a discomfort function along the Z-axis) and horizontal proximity (via a classic XY-plane formulation) to quantify discomfort.

Large-scale remote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is an important tool for this task. However, using supervised methods to detect changes is difficult because of the lack of satellite data annotated with change labels, especially for rare categories of change. Annotation proves challenging due to the sparse occurrence of changes in satellite images. Even within a vast collection of images, only a small fraction may exhibit persistent changes of interest. To address this challenge, we introduce OPTIMUS, a self-supervised learning method based on an intuitive principle: if a model can recover information about the relative order of images in the time series, then that implies that there are long-lasting changes in the images. OPTIMUS demonstrates this principle by using change point detection methods on model outputs in a time series. We demonstrate that OPTIMUS can directly detect interesting changes in satellite images, achieving an improvement in AUROC score from 56.3% to 87.6% at distinguishing changed time series from unchanged ones compared to baselines.

While these approaches help explain model behavior, current methods lack statistical rigor, making it challenging to validate identified concepts and compare different techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework that quantifies rotation-sensitive structures within the CLIP embedding space. Once such structures are identified, we propose a post-hoc concept decomposition method. Unlike existing approaches, it offers theoretical guarantees that discovered concepts represent robust, reproducible patterns (rather than method-specific artifacts) and outperforms other techniques in terms of reconstruction error. Empirically, we demonstrate that our concept-based decomposition algorithm effectively balances reconstruction accuracy with concept interpretability and helps mitigate spurious cues in data.

This allow legal professionals to use such interpretations as precedents as well as laymen to better understand the legal concept.

That manual annotation process can be quite expensive and need to be repeated for each such concept, which prompted recent research in trying to automate this process. In this paper, we highlight the results of various experiments conducted to determine the volume, scope and even the need for manual annotation.

We categorize contactless object-transport strategies into independent transport (uncoordinated) and forward-facing cooperative transport (coordinated), drawing parallels with biological systems to optimize efficiency and robustness. The proposed system is experimentally validated by evaluating levitation stability using a microphone in the measurement lab, transport efficiency through a phase-space motion capture system, and clock synchronization accuracy via an oscilloscope.

We formulate the guidance as an optimization problem where one optimizes for a desired fitness function through updates to the descriptive statistic for the denoising distribution, and derive an evolution-guided approach from first principles through the lens of probabilistic evolution. Interestingly, the final derived update algorithm is analogous to the update as per common gradient-based guided diffusion models, but without ever having to compute any derivatives. We validate our proposed evolvable diffusion algorithm in two AI for Science scenarios: the automated design of fluidic topology and meta-surface.

Current AI systems based on large language models (LLMs) can provide feedback that makes people feel heard. Yet it remains unclear whether LLMs represent emotion in language as humans do, or whether and how the emotional tone of their output can be controlled. We assess human-AI emotional alignment across linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM features translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion categories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived emotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by the fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these emotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data on word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and language-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived solely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can be stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which provides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to systematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when conveying content. These findings suggest AI not only shares emotional representations with humans but its affective outputs can be precisely guided using psychologically grounded emotion concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0cAI\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u7cbe\u786e\u8c03\u63a7AI\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u8868\u8fbe\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684LLM\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "LLM\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u3002\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8c03\u63a7\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\u7cbe\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, effective transfer faces two critical challenges. Firstly, the network heterophily problem, which is caused by bots hiding malicious behaviors via indiscriminately interacting with human users, hinders the model's ability to learn sufficient and accurate bot-related knowledge from source domains. Secondly, single-source transfer might lead to inferior and unstable results, as the source network may embody weak relevance to the task and provide limited knowledge. To address these challenges, we explore multiple source domains and propose a multi-source graph domain adaptation model named \\textit{BotTrans}. We initially leverage the labeling knowledge shared across multiple source networks to establish a cross-source-domain topology with increased network homophily. We then aggregate cross-domain neighbor information to enhance the discriminability of source node embeddings. Subsequently, we integrate the relevance between each source-target pair with model optimization, which facilitates knowledge transfer from source networks that are more relevant to the detection task. Additionally, we propose a refinement strategy to improve detection performance by utilizing semantic knowledge within the target domain.

Vision-only methods often struggle to generalize, resulting in pixel misclassification between similar classes, poor generalization and boundary localization. Vision-Language Models offer robust, domain-invariant semantics but lack the spatial grounding required for dense prediction. We introduce HierVL, a unified framework that bridges this gap by integrating abstract text embeddings into a mask-transformer architecture tailored for semi-supervised segmentation. HierVL features three novel components: a Hierarchical Semantic Query Generator that filters and projects abstract class embeddings into multi-scale queries to suppress irrelevant classes and handle intra-class variability; a Cross-Modal Spatial Alignment Module that aligns semantic queries with pixel features for sharper boundaries under sparse supervision; and a Dual-Query Transformer Decoder that fuses semantic and instance-level queries to prevent instance collapse. We also introduce targeted regularization losses that maintain vision-language alignment throughout training to reinforce semantic grounding. HierVL establishes a new state-of-the-art by achieving a +4.4% mean improvement of the intersection over the union on COCO (with 232 labeled images), +3.1% on Pascal VOC (with 92 labels), +5.9% on ADE20 (with 158 labels) and +1.8% on Cityscapes (with 100 labels), demonstrating better performance under 1% supervision on four benchmark datasets.

In this study, we introduce T-REX, an open-source, SUMO-based simulation framework for training and evaluating RL-TSC methods under dynamic, incident scenarios. T-REX models realistic network-level performance considering drivers' probabilistic rerouting, speed adaptation, and contextual lane-changing, enabling the simulation of congestion propagation under incidents. To assess robustness, we propose a suite of metrics that extend beyond conventional traffic efficiency measures. Through extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world networks, we showcase T-REX for the evaluation of several state-of-the-art RL-TSC methods under multiple real-world deployment paradigms. Our findings show that while independent value-based and decentralized pressure-based methods offer fast convergence and generalization in stable traffic conditions and homogeneous networks, their performance degrades sharply under incident-driven distribution shifts. In contrast, hierarchical coordination methods tend to offer more stable and adaptable performance in large-scale, irregular networks, benefiting from their structured decision-making architecture. However, this comes with the trade-off of slower convergence and higher training complexity. These findings highlight the need for robustness-aware design and evaluation in RL-TSC research.

When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings.

For that reason, ML systems require regular maintenance, typically based on model retraining. However, retraining requires significant computational demand, which makes it energy-intensive and raises concerns about its environmental impact. To understand which retraining techniques should be considered when designing sustainable ML applications, in this work, we study the energy consumption of common retraining techniques. Since the accuracy of ML systems is also essential, we compare retraining techniques in terms of both energy efficiency and accuracy. We showcase that retraining with only the most recent data, compared to all available data, reduces energy consumption by up to 25\\%, being a sustainable alternative to the status quo. Furthermore, our findings show that retraining a model only when there is evidence that updates are necessary, rather than on a fixed schedule, can reduce energy consumption by up to 40\\%, provided a reliable data change detector is in place.

In recent work, morpho-transition has been studied from a model-based control perspective, but these approaches remain limited due to unmodeled dynamics and the requirement for planning through contacts. Here, we train an end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) controller to learn a morpho-transition policy and demonstrate successful transfer to hardware. We find that the RL control policy achieves agile landing, but only transfers to hardware if motor dynamics and observation delays are taken into account. On the other hand, a baseline MPC controller transfers out-of-the-box without knowledge of the actuator dynamics and delays, at the cost of reduced recovery from disturbances in the event of unknown actuator failures.

These causal aspects of human cognition are thought to underlie humans' ability to generalize and learn efficiently in new domains, an area where current machine learning systems are weak. Building human-like causal competency into machine learning systems may facilitate the construction of effective and interpretable AI. Indeed, the machine learning community has been importing ideas on causality formalized by the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, which provides a rigorous formal language for many aspects of causality and has led to significant advances. However, the SCM framework fails to capture some salient aspects of human causal cognition and has likewise not yet led to advances in machine learning in certain critical areas where humans excel. We contend that the problem of causality in the ``human niche'' -- for a social, autonomous, and goal-driven agent sensing and acting in the world in which humans live -- is quite different from the kind of causality captured by SCMs. For example, everyday objects come in similar types that have similar causal properties, and so humans readily generalize knowledge of one type of object (cups) to another related type (bowls) by drawing causal analogies between objects with similar properties, but such analogies are at best awkward to express in SCMs. We explore how such causal capabilities are adaptive in, and motivated by, the human niche. By better appreciating properties of human causal cognition and, crucially, how those properties are adaptive in the niche in which humans live, we hope that future work at the intersection of machine learning and causality will leverage more human-like inductive biases to create more capable, controllable, and interpretable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684AI\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86SCM\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u5728\u201c\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6001\u4f4d\u201d\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "SCM\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7c7b\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u56e0\u679c\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, detecting and localizing unknown objects is crucial for safety-critical applications in domains such as autonomous driving and medical imaging. Recently, Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a vital research direction for OD, focusing on identifying incorrect predictions typically associated with unknown objects. This paper shows that the current evaluation protocol for OOD-OD violates the assumption of non-overlapping objects with respect to the In-Distribution (ID) datasets, and obscures crucial situations such as ignoring unknown objects, potentially leading to overconfidence in deployment scenarios where truly novel objects might be encountered. To address these limitations, we manually curate, and enrich the existing benchmark by exploiting semantic similarity to create new evaluation splits categorized as $\\textit{near}$, $\\textit{far}$, and $\\textit{farther}$ from ID distributions. Additionally, we incorporate established metrics from the Open Set community, providing deeper insights into how effectively methods detect unknowns, when they ignore them, and when they mistakenly classify OOD objects as ID. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that semantically and visually close OOD objects are easier to localize than far ones, but are also more easily confounded with ID objects. $\\textit{Far}$ and $\\textit{farther}$ objects are harder to localize but less prone to be taken for an ID object.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524dOOD-OD\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684OOD\u5bf9\u8c61\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709OOD-OD\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3002", "method": "\u624b\u52a8\u6574\u7406\u5e76\u4e30\u5bcc\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\uff08near\u3001far\u3001farther\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684OOD\u5bf9\u8c61\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f46\u6613\u4e0eID\u5bf9\u8c61\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u800cfar\u548cfarther\u5bf9\u8c61\u66f4\u96be\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f46\u4e0d\u6613\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, due to the lack of long-term and fine-grained spatial and temporal data in public and population health studies, most existing studies fail to incorporate environmental data, limiting the models' performance and real-world application. To address this shortage, we developed SatHealth, a novel dataset combining multimodal spatiotemporal data, including environmental data, satellite images, all-disease prevalences estimated from medical claims, and social determinants of health (SDoH) indicators. We conducted experiments under two use cases with SatHealth: regional public health modeling and personal disease risk prediction. Experimental results show that living environmental information can significantly improve AI models' performance and temporal-spatial generalizability on various tasks. Finally, we deploy a web-based application to provide an exploration tool for SatHealth and one-click access to both our data and regional environmental embedding to facilitate plug-and-play utilization. SatHealth is now published with data in Ohio, and we will keep updating SatHealth to cover the other parts of the US.

We demonstrate that using right-context is more effective in zipformer models compared to other conformer models due to its multi-scale nature. We analyze the effect of varying the number of right-context frames on accuracy and latency of the streaming ASR models. We use Librispeech and large in-house conversational datasets to train different versions of streaming and non-streaming models and evaluate them in a production grade server-client setup across diverse testsets of different domains. The proposed strategy reduces word error by relative 7.9\\% with a small degradation in user-perceived latency.

This allows free-form text control of appearance attributes like age, hair style, and glasses, and 3D geometry control of face expression and camera pose. In this setting, we assume we use a pre-trained large vision-language model (LVLM; CLIP) to generate from a smaller 2D dataset with no additional paired labels and with a pre-defined 3D morphable model (FLAME). First, we disentangle using canonicalization to a 2D reference frame from a deformable neural 3D triplane representation. But another form of entanglement arises from the significant noise in the LVLM's embedding space that describes irrelevant features. This damages output quality and diversity, but we overcome this with a Jacobian regularization that can be computed efficiently with a stochastic approximator.

Unlike discrete surface representation approaches, which approximate surfaces using discrete elements (e.g., tessellations or sub-spheres) with constraints between nearby faces, edges, nodes, or sub-objects, our algorithm solves a recursively generated linear complementarity problem (ReLCP) to adaptively identify potential collision locations during the collision resolution procedure. Despite adaptively and in contrast to Newton-esque schemes, we prove conditions under which the resulting solution exists and the center of mass translational and rotational dynamics are unique. Our ReLCP also converges to classical LCP-based collision resolution for sufficiently small timesteps. Because increasing the surface resolution in discrete representation methods necessitates subdividing geometry into finer elements -- leading to a super-linear increase in the number of collision constraints -- these approaches scale poorly with increased surface resolution. In contrast, our adaptive ReLCP framework begins with a single constraint per pair of nearby bodies and introduces new constraints only when unconstrained motion would lead to overlap, circumventing the oversampling required by discrete methods. By requiring one to two orders of magnitude fewer collision constraints to achieve the same surface resolution, we observe 10-100x speedup in densely packed applications. We validate our ReLCP method against multisphere and single-constraint methods, comparing convergence in a two-ellipsoid collision test, scalability and performance in a compacting ellipsoid suspension and growing bacterial colony, and stability in a taut chainmail network, highlighting our ability to achieve high-fidelity surface representations without suffering from poor scalability or artificial surface roughness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u89e3\u51b3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5149\u6ed1\u975e\u7403\u5f62\u521a\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff08ReLCP\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc6\u522b\u78b0\u649e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8d85\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u9762\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u6570\u91cf\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\uff08ReLCP\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bc6\u522b\u78b0\u649e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u675f\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cReLCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u8868\u9762\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c111-2\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710-100\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLCP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8868\u9762\u8868\u793a\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce SimpleDoc, a lightweight yet powerful retrieval - augmented framework for DocVQA. It boosts evidence page gathering by first retrieving candidates through embedding similarity and then filtering and re-ranking these candidates based on page summaries. A single VLM-based reasoner agent repeatedly invokes this dual-cue retriever, iteratively pulling fresh pages into a working memory until the question is confidently answered.

Drawing on phenomenological and inductive methods, it argues that pitch is not an ontologically objective property but a perceptual construct shaped by listeners and conditions. Analyses of quasi-harmonic tones reveal that a single tone can convey multiple pitches, giving rise to tonal fission. The perception of pitch may also be multistable, varying for the same listener over time. In this framework, the tuning system may emerge from a tone's internal structure.

However, these capabilities are predominantly benchmarked on domains like mathematical problem solving and code generation -- leaving open the question of whether such reasoning skills generalize to complex, real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce LocationReasoner, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in the context of real-world site selection, where models must identify feasible locations by reasoning over diverse and complicated spatial, environmental, and logistical constraints. The benchmark comprises over 300 carefully crafted queries of varying difficulty levels, supported by a sandbox environment with in-house tools for constraint-based location search. Extensive evaluations reveal that state-of-the-art reasoning models offer limited improvement over their non-reasoning predecessors in real-world contexts, with even the latest OpenAI o4 model failing on 30% of site selection tasks. Moreover, agentic strategies such as ReAct and Reflexion often suffer from over-reasoning, leading to worse outcomes than direct code-generation prompting. With key limitations of LLMs in holistic and non-linear reasoning highlighted, we release LocationReasoner to foster the development of LLMs and agents capable of robust, grounded reasoning in real-world decision-making tasks.

However, as rule-based models grow complex, discerning crucial features, understanding their interactions, and comparing feature contributions across different rule sets becomes challenging. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for estimating feature contributions in rule-based systems, introducing a graph-based feature visualisation strategy, a novel feature importance metric agnostic to rule-based predictors, and a distance metric for comparing rule sets based on feature contributions. By experimenting on two clinical datasets and four rule-based methods (decision trees, logic learning machines, association rules, and neural networks with rule extraction), we showcase our method's capability to uncover novel insights on the combined predictive value of clinical features, both at the dataset and class-specific levels. These insights can aid in identifying new risk factors, signature genes, and potential biomarkers, and determining the subset of patient information that should be prioritised to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Comparative analysis of the proposed feature importance score with state-of-the-art methods on 15 public benchmarks demonstrates competitive performance and superior robustness.

While a related task, audio fingerprinting, has made significant progress in accurately retrieving musical content under \"real world\" (noisy, reverberant) conditions, ASID systems struggle to identify samples that have undergone musical modifications. Thus, a system robust to common music production transformations such as time-stretching, pitch-shifting, effects processing, and underlying or overlaying music is an important open challenge.\n  In this work, we propose a lightweight and scalable encoding architecture employing a Graph Neural Network within a contrastive learning framework. Our model uses only 9% of the trainable parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art system while achieving comparable performance, reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 44.2%.\n  To enhance retrieval quality, we introduce a two-stage approach consisting of an initial coarse similarity search for candidate selection, followed by a cross-attention classifier that rejects irrelevant matches and refines the ranking of retrieved candidates - an essential capability absent in prior models.

We propose a framework to assess and report explainable AI features. Our evaluation framework for AI explainability is based on four criteria: 1) Consistency quantifies the variability of explanations to similar inputs, 2) Plausibility estimates how close the explanation is to the ground truth, 3) Fidelity assesses the alignment between the explanation and the model internal mechanisms, and 4) Usefulness evaluates the impact on task performance of the explanation. Finally, we developed a scorecard for AI explainability methods that serves as a complete description and evaluation to accompany this type of algorithm. We describe these four criteria and give examples on how they can be evaluated.

Existing approaches typically treat all facial pixels equally, resulting in suboptimal allocation of computational resources and degraded FSR performance. CNN is relatively sensitive to high-frequency facial features, such as component contours and facial outlines. Meanwhile, Mamba excels at capturing low-frequency features like facial color and fine-grained texture, and does so with lower complexity than Transformers. Motivated by these observations, we propose FADPNet, a Frequency-Aware Dual-Path Network that decomposes facial features into low- and high-frequency components and processes them via dedicated branches. For low-frequency regions, we introduce a Mamba-based Low-Frequency Enhancement Block (LFEB), which combines state-space attention with squeeze-and-excitation operations to extract low-frequency global interactions and emphasize informative channels. For high-frequency regions, we design a CNN-based Deep Position-Aware Attention (DPA) module to enhance spatially-dependent structural details, complemented by a lightweight High-Frequency Refinement (HFR) module that further refines frequency-specific representations.

Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

However, general medical knowledge must be adapted to specific healthcare settings and patient populations to achieve practical clinical use.

We present a novel approach for constructing BNs from ontology-based KGs and multimodal EHR data for explainable disease risk prediction.

While existing methods achieve strong performance, balancing accuracy and real-time inference remains a challenge. To address this, we propose a logits-based knowledge distillation framework for MOS, aiming to improve accuracy while maintaining real-time efficiency. Specifically, we adopt a Bird's Eye View (BEV) projection-based model as the student and a non-projection model as the teacher. To handle the severe imbalance between moving and non-moving classes, we decouple them and apply tailored distillation strategies, allowing the teacher model to better learn key motion-related features. This approach significantly reduces false positives and false negatives. Additionally, we introduce dynamic upsampling, optimize the network architecture, and achieve a 7.69% reduction in parameter count, mitigating overfitting.

However, prior work has shown that tokenization can introduce distortion into the model's generations. For example, users are often advised not to end their prompts with a space because it prevents the model from including the space as part of the next token. This Prompt Boundary Problem (PBP) also arises in languages such as Chinese and in code generation, where tokens often do not line up with syntactic boundaries. Additionally mismatching tokenizers often hinder model composition and interoperability. For example, it is not possible to directly ensemble models with different tokenizers due to their mismatching vocabularies. To address these issues, we present an inference-time method to convert any autoregressive LM with a BPE tokenizer into a character-level or byte-level LM, without changing its generative distribution at the text level. Our method efficient solves the PBP and is also able to unify the vocabularies of language models with different tokenizers, allowing one to ensemble LMs with different tokenizers at inference time as well as transfer the post-training from one model to another using proxy-tuning.

This paper proposes a novel gripper, Lasso Gripper. Inspired by traditional tools like the lasso and the uurga, Lasso Gripper captures objects by launching and retracting a string. Contrary to antipodal grippers, which concentrate force on a limited area, Lasso Gripper applies uniform pressure along the length of the string for a more gentle grasp. The gripper is controlled by four motors-two for launching the string inward and two for launching it outward. By adjusting motor speeds, the size of the string loop can be tuned to accommodate objects of varying sizes, eliminating the limitations imposed by the maximum gripper separation distance. To address the issue of string tangling during rapid retraction, a specialized mechanism was incorporated. Additionally, a dynamic model was developed to estimate the string's curve, providing a foundation for the kinematic analysis of the workspace. In grasping experiments, Lasso Gripper, mounted on a robotic arm, successfully captured and transported a range of objects, including bull and horse figures as well as delicate vegetables.

This lack of personalization is particularly problematic in specialized knowledge-intense domains like IT/cybersecurity (ITSec), where user knowledge levels vary widely. Existing approaches for chatbot personalization primarily rely on static user categories or explicit self-reported information, limiting their adaptability to an evolving perception of the user's proficiency, obtained in the course of ongoing interactions. In this paper, we propose ProfiLLM, a novel framework for implicit and dynamic user profiling through chatbot interactions. This framework consists of a taxonomy that can be adapted for use in diverse domains and an LLM-based method for user profiling in terms of the taxonomy. To demonstrate ProfiLLM's effectiveness, we apply it in the ITSec domain where troubleshooting interactions are used to infer chatbot users' technical proficiency. Specifically, we developed ProfiLLM[ITSec], an ITSec-adapted variant of ProfiLLM, and evaluated its performance on 1,760 human-like chatbot conversations from 263 synthetic users. Results show that ProfiLLM[ITSec] rapidly and accurately infers ITSec profiles, reducing the gap between actual and predicted scores by up to 55--65\\% after a single prompt, followed by minor fluctuations and further refinement. In addition to evaluating our new implicit and dynamic profiling framework, we also propose an LLM-based persona simulation methodology, a structured taxonomy for ITSec proficiency, our codebase, and a dataset of chatbot interactions to support future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProfiLLM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u4e92\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8eIT/\u7f51\u7edc\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6280\u672f\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u7528\u6237\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProfiLLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ITSec\u9886\u57df\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u53d8\u4f53ProfiLLM[ITSec]\u3002", "result": "\u57281,760\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\uff0cProfiLLM[ITSec]\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u7528\u6237\u6280\u672f\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\uff0c\u5355\u6b21\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u6570\u5dee\u8ddd\u51cf\u5c1155-65%\u3002", "conclusion": "ProfiLLM\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7528\u6237\u753b\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this work, our observation is that the differences between the preferred response $y^+$ and dispreferred response $y^-$ influence what LLMs can learn, which may not match the desirable differences to learn. Therefore, we use distance and reward margin to quantify these differences, and combine them to get Distance Calibrated Reward Margin (DCRM), a metric that measures the quality of a response pair for PO. Intuitively, DCRM encourages minimal noisy differences and maximal desired differences. With this, we study 3 types of commonly used preference datasets, classified along two axes: the source of the responses and the preference labeling function. We establish a general correlation between higher DCRM of the training set and better learning outcome. Inspired by this, we propose a best-of-$N^2$ pairing method that selects response pairs with the highest DCRM.

Despite their potential, conventional 3D indoor scene graphs face critical limitations, particularly under- and over-segmentation of room layers in structurally complex environments. Under-segmentation misclassifies non-traversable areas as part of a room, often in open spaces, while over-segmentation fragments a single room into overlapping segments in complex environments. These issues stem from naive voxel-based map representations that rely solely on geometric proximity, disregarding the structural constraints of traversable spaces and resulting in inconsistent room layers within scene graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to tackle segmentation inconsistency as a challenge and address it with Traversability-Aware Consistent Scene Graphs (TACS-Graphs), a novel framework that integrates ground robot traversability with room segmentation. By leveraging traversability as a key factor in defining room boundaries, the proposed method achieves a more semantically meaningful and topologically coherent segmentation, effectively mitigating the inaccuracies of voxel-based scene graph approaches in complex environments. Furthermore, the enhanced segmentation consistency improves loop closure detection efficiency in the proposed Consistent Scene Graph-leveraging Loop Closure Detection (CoSG-LCD) leading to higher pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scene graph consistency and pose graph optimization performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6TACS-Graphs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u623f\u95f4\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e2d\u623f\u95f4\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf3D\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u623f\u95f4\u5c42\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6b20\u5206\u5272\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTACS-Graphs\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u623f\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408CoSG-LCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u95ed\u73af\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "TACS-Graphs\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, their autoregressive nature leads to substantial inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Speculative sampling mitigates this issue by introducing a drafting phase followed by a parallel validation phase, enabling faster token generation and verification. Existing approaches, however, overlook the inherent coherence in text generation, limiting their efficiency. To address this gap, we propose a Speculative Sampling with Syntactic and Semantic Coherence (S$^4$C) framework, which extends speculative sampling by leveraging multi-head drafting for rapid token generation and a continuous verification tree for efficient candidate validation and feature reuse. Experimental results demonstrate that S$^4$C surpasses baseline methods across mainstream tasks, offering enhanced efficiency, parallelism, and the ability to generate more valid tokens with fewer computational resources.

During multi-robot operations, a robot needs to know the relative pose between itself and its teammates with respect to its own coordinates. However, different robots usually observe completely different views that contains similar objects, which leads to wrong pose estimation. In addition, it is unrealistic to allow robots to share their raw observations to detect overlap due to the limited communication bandwidth constraint. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for Non-Overlap-Aware Egocentric Pose Estimation (NOPE), which performs egocentric pose estimation in a multi-robot team while identifying the non-overlap views and satifying the communication bandwidth constraint. NOPE is built upon an unified hierarchical learning framework that integrates two levels of robot learning: (1) high-level deep graph matching for correspondence identification, which allows to identify if two views are overlapping or not, (2) low-level position-aware cross-attention graph learning for egocentric pose estimation. To evaluate NOPE, we conduct extensive experiments in both high-fidelity simulation and real-world scenarios. Experimental results have demonstrated that NOPE enables the novel capability for non-overlapping-aware egocentric pose estimation and achieves state-of-art performance compared with the existing methods.

While existing approaches primarily focus on social interactions between pedestrians, they often overlook the rich environmental context that significantly shapes human movement patterns. In this paper, we propose SceneAware, a novel framework that explicitly incorporates scene understanding to enhance trajectory prediction accuracy. Our method leverages a Vision Transformer~(ViT) scene encoder to process environmental context from static scene images, while Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) generate binary walkability masks that distinguish between accessible and restricted areas during training. We combine a Transformer-based trajectory encoder with the ViT-based scene encoder, capturing both temporal dynamics and spatial constraints. The framework integrates collision penalty mechanisms that discourage predicted trajectories from violating physical boundaries, ensuring physically plausible predictions. SceneAware is implemented in both deterministic and stochastic variants. Comprehensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with more than 50\\% improvement over previous models. Our analysis based on different trajectory categories shows that the model performs consistently well across various types of pedestrian movement. This highlights the importance of using explicit scene information and shows that our scene-aware approach is both effective and reliable in generating accurate and physically plausible predictions.

We find that RLVR drives performance through two main means: (1) by compressing pass@$k$ into pass@1 and (2) via \"capability gain\" in which models learn to solve new problems that they previously could not solve even at high $k$. We find that while capability gain exists across model scales, learning to solve new problems is primarily driven through self-distillation. We demonstrate these findings across model scales ranging from 0.5B to 72B on >500,000 reasoning problems with prompts and verifiable final answers across math, science, and code domains. We further show that we can significantly improve pass@$k$ rates by leveraging natural language guidance for the model to consider within context while still requiring the model to derive a solution chain from scratch. Based of these insights, we derive $\\text{Guide}$ - a new class of online training algorithms. $\\text{Guide}$ adaptively incorporates hints into the model's context on problems for which all rollouts were initially incorrect and adjusts the importance sampling ratio for the \"off-policy\" trajectories in order to optimize the policy for contexts in which the hints are no longer present. We describe variants of $\\text{Guide}$ for GRPO and PPO and empirically show that Guide-GRPO on 7B and 32B parameter models improves generalization over its vanilla counterpart with up to 4$\\%$ macro-average improvement across math benchmarks.

Evaluating this bias is challenging, as conventional direct-query methods are susceptible to social desirability effects and fail to capture its subtle, multi-dimensional nature. To this end, we propose an evaluation framework that leverages the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) to reconceptualize bias as a multi-dimensional failure in ToM across Competence, Sociability, and Morality. The framework introduces two indirect tasks: the Word Association Bias Test (WABT) to assess implicit lexical associations and the Affective Attribution Test (AAT) to measure covert affective leanings, both designed to probe latent stereotypes without triggering model avoidance. Extensive experiments on 8 State-of-the-Art LLMs demonstrate our framework's capacity to reveal complex bias structures, including pervasive sociability bias, multi-dimensional divergence, and asymmetric stereotype amplification, thereby providing a more robust methodology for identifying the structural nature of implicit bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u5185\u5bb9\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95f4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5728\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76f4\u63a5\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u6548\u5e94\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u95f4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8054\u60f3\u504f\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08WABT\uff09\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5f52\u56e0\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08AAT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5982\u666e\u904d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5206\u6b67\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Penalty-based simulators, such as MuJoCo, simplify gradient computation by softening the contact forces. However, realistically simulating hard contacts requires very stiff contact settings, which leads to incorrect gradients when using automatic differentiation. On the other hand, using non-stiff settings strongly increases the sim-to-real gap. We analyze the contact computation of penalty-based simulators to identify the causes of gradient errors. Then, we propose DiffMJX, which combines adaptive integration with MuJoCo XLA, to notably improve gradient quality in the presence of hard contacts. Finally, we address a key limitation of contact gradients: they vanish when objects do not touch. To overcome this, we introduce Contacts From Distance (CFD), a mechanism that enables the simulator to generate informative contact gradients even before objects are in contact. To preserve physical realism, we apply CFD only in the backward pass using a straight-through trick, allowing us to compute useful gradients without modifying the forward simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiffMJX\u548cCFD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u786c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u7b80\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u786c\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u62df\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u521a\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u65f6\u68af\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53c8\u589e\u52a0\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u68af\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u539f\u56e0\uff1b\u63d0\u51faDiffMJX\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u79ef\u5206\u4e0eMuJoCo XLA\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165CFD\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u901a\u6280\u5de7\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "DiffMJX\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u786c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff1bCFD\u5728\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DiffMJX\u548cCFD\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u786c\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, conventional SL frameworks' one-split-fits-all strategy is a critical limitation in agricultural ecosystems where edge insect monitoring devices exhibit vast heterogeneity in computational power, energy constraints, and connectivity. This leads to straggler bottlenecks, inefficient resource utilization, and compromised model performance. Bridging this gap, we introduce ReinDSplit, a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-driven framework that dynamically tailors DNN split points for each device, optimizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a Q-learning agent acts as an adaptive orchestrator, balancing workloads and latency thresholds across devices to mitigate computational starvation or overload. By framing split layer selection as a finite-state Markov decision process, ReinDSplit convergence ensures that highly constrained devices contribute meaningfully to model training over time. Evaluated on three insect classification datasets using ResNet18, GoogleNet, and MobileNetV2, ReinDSplit achieves 94.31% accuracy with MobileNetV2.

However, since speech is continuous and complex, it is often discretized for autoregressive modeling. Speech tokens derived from self-supervised models (known as semantic tokens) typically focus on the linguistic aspects of speech but neglect prosodic information. As a result, models trained on these tokens can generate speech with reduced naturalness. Existing approaches try to fix this by adding pitch features to the semantic tokens. However, pitch alone cannot fully represent the range of paralinguistic attributes, and selecting the right features requires careful hand-engineering. To overcome this, we propose an end-to-end variational approach that automatically learns to encode these continuous speech attributes to enhance the semantic tokens. Our approach eliminates the need for manual extraction and selection of paralinguistic features. Moreover, it produces preferred speech continuations according to human raters.

In contrast, vast amounts of action-free video data are readily available, but translating these observations into effective policies remains a challenge. We introduce AMPLIFY, a novel framework that leverages large-scale video data by encoding visual dynamics into compact, discrete motion tokens derived from keypoint trajectories. Our modular approach separates visual motion prediction from action inference, decoupling the challenges of learning what motion defines a task from how robots can perform it. We train a forward dynamics model on abundant action-free videos and an inverse dynamics model on a limited set of action-labeled examples, allowing for independent scaling. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the learned dynamics are both accurate, achieving up to 3.7x better MSE and over 2.5x better pixel prediction accuracy compared to prior approaches, and broadly useful. In downstream policy learning, our dynamics predictions enable a 1.2-2.2x improvement in low-data regimes, a 1.4x average improvement by learning from action-free human videos, and the first generalization to LIBERO tasks from zero in-distribution action data. Beyond robotic control, we find the dynamics learned by AMPLIFY to be a versatile latent world model, enhancing video prediction quality.

However, current studies have limitations in modality selection, feature extraction and fusion, and co-inference for decision making, which restrict further improvement in the accuracy, applicability and reliability of multimodal fusion models. To address this problem, this study proposes a Multi-stage Augmented Multimodal Interaction Network (MAINet) for quantifying fish feeding intensity. Firstly, a general feature extraction framework is proposed to efficiently extract feature information from input image, audio and water wave datas. Second, an Auxiliary-modality Reinforcement Primary-modality Mechanism (ARPM) is designed for inter-modal interaction and generate enhanced features, which consists of a Channel Attention Fusion Network (CAFN) and a Dual-mode Attention Fusion Network (DAFN). Finally, an Evidence Reasoning (ER) rule is introduced to fuse the output results of each modality and make decisions, thereby completing the quantification of fish feeding intensity. The experimental results show that the constructed MAINet reaches 96.76%, 96.78%, 96.79% and 96.79% in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score respectively, and its performance is significantly higher than the comparison models. Compared with models that adopt single-modality, dual-modality fusion and different decision-making fusion methods, it also has obvious advantages.

Recent research has shown that incorporating intrinsic motivation mechanisms into EDTs improves performance across exploration tasks, yet the representational mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a systematic post-hoc explainability framework to analyze how intrinsic motivation shapes learned embeddings in EDTs. Through statistical analysis of embedding properties (including covariance structure, vector magnitudes, and orthogonality), we reveal that different intrinsic motivation variants create fundamentally different representational structures. Our analysis demonstrates environment-specific correlation patterns between embedding metrics and performance that explain why intrinsic motivation improves policy learning. These findings show that intrinsic motivation operates beyond simple exploration bonuses, acting as a representational prior that shapes embedding geometry in biologically plausible ways, creating environment-specific organizational structures that facilitate better decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u4e8b\u540e\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f39\u6027\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08EDTs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u53d8\u4f53\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u5728EDTs\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5411\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u5bf9\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u53d8\u4f53\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u622a\u7136\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5d4c\u5165\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u673a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u63a2\u7d22\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u7269\u5408\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5851\u9020\u5d4c\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

While prior MIA research has primarily focused on performance metrics such as AUC, accuracy, and TPR@low FPR - either by developing new methods to enhance these metrics or using them to evaluate privacy solutions - we found that it overlooks the disparities among different attacks. These disparities, both between distinct attack methods and between multiple instantiations of the same method, have crucial implications for the reliability and completeness of MIAs as privacy evaluation tools. In this paper, we systematically investigate these disparities through a novel framework based on coverage and stability analysis. Extensive experiments reveal significant disparities in MIAs, their potential causes, and their broader implications for privacy evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose an ensemble framework with three distinct strategies to harness the strengths of state-of-the-art MIAs while accounting for their disparities.

To this end, we propose Narrate2Nav, a novel real-time vision-action model that leverages a novel self-supervised learning framework based on the Barlow Twins redundancy reduction loss to embed implicit natural language reasoning, social cues, and human intentions within a visual encoder-enabling reasoning in the model's latent space rather than token space. The model combines RGB inputs, motion commands, and textual signals of scene context during training to bridge from robot observations to low-level motion commands for short-horizon point-goal navigation during deployment. Extensive evaluation of Narrate2Nav across various challenging scenarios in both offline unseen dataset and real-world experiments demonstrates an overall improvement of 52.94 percent and 41.67 percent, respectively, over the next best baseline.

However, ensuring the relevance of retrieved documents with a query would be a big challenge. To address this, a secondary model, known as a relevant grader, can be served to verify its relevance. To reduce computational requirements of a relevant grader, a lightweight small language model is preferred.

Despite deep models have made significant advances in capturing the discriminative long-term dependency of surgical videos to achieve improved recognition, they rarely account for exploring and modeling the uncertainty in surgical videos, which should be crucial for reliable online surgical phase recognition. We categorize the sources of uncertainty into two types, frame ambiguity in videos and unbalanced distribution among surgical phases, which are inevitable in surgical videos. To address this pivot issue, we introduce a meta-learning-optimized classification diffusion model (Meta-SurDiff), to take full advantage of the deep generative model and meta-learning in achieving precise frame-level distribution estimation for reliable online surgical phase recognition. For coarse recognition caused by ambiguous video frames, we employ a classification diffusion model to assess the confidence of recognition results at a finer-grained frame-level instance. For coarse recognition caused by unbalanced phase distribution, we use a meta-learning based objective to learn the diffusion model, thus enhancing the robustness of classification boundaries for different surgical phases.We establish effectiveness of Meta-SurDiff in online surgical phase recognition through extensive experiments on five widely used datasets using more than four practical metrics. The datasets include Cholec80, AutoLaparo, M2Cai16, OphNet, and NurViD, where OphNet comes from ophthalmic surgeries, NurViD is the daily care dataset, while the others come from laparoscopic surgeries.

To this end, we first leverage Robust adaptive Control Barrier Functions (RaCBFs) to handle model uncertainty, along with the concept of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to ensure robustness towards input disturbances.

While prior work has noted positional order biases in LLM-driven comparisons, these biases have not been systematically dissected or linked to underlying preference structures. We provide the first comprehensive investigation of positional biases across multiple LLM architectures and domains, uncovering strong and consistent order effects, including a novel centrality bias not previously documented in human or machine decision-making. We also find a quality-dependent shift: when options are high quality, models exhibit primacy bias, but favor latter options when option quality is low. We further identify a previously undocumented bias favoring certain names over others. To distinguish superficial tie-breaking from true distortions of judgment, we introduce a framework that classifies pairwise preferences as robust, fragile, or indifferent. We show that order effects can lead models to select strictly inferior options, and that positional biases are typically stronger than gender biases. These findings suggest that LLMs are not merely inheriting human-like biases, but exhibit distinct failure modes not seen in human decision-making.

Existing human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods mainly focus on the third-person perspectives, overlooking a more intuitive way from the egocentric view of HOI, namely Ego-HOI. This paper introduces an Ego-HOIBench, a new dataset to promote the benchmarking and development of Ego-HOI detection. Our Ego-HOIBench comprises more than 27K egocentric images with high-quality hand-verb-object triplet annotations across 123 fine-grained interaction categories and locations, covering a rich diversity of scenarios, object types, and hand configurations in daily activities. In addition, we explore and adapt third-person HOI detection methods to Ego-HOIBench and illustrate the challenges of hand-occluded objects and the complexity of single- and two-hand interactions. To build a new baseline, we propose a Hand Geometry and Interactivity Refinement (HGIR) scheme, which leverages hand pose and geometric information as valuable cues for interpreting interactions. Specifically, the HGIR scheme explicitly extracts global hand geometric features from the estimated hand pose proposals and refines the interaction-specific features using pose-interaction attention. This scheme enables the model to obtain a robust and powerful interaction representation, significantly improving the Ego-HOI detection capability. Our approach is lightweight and effective, and it can be easily applied to HOI baselines in a plug-and-play manner to achieve state-of-the-art results on Ego-HOIBench.

We then conduct two extensive human studies to assess the utility of language model-generated explanatory answers (explanations) on our benchmark, tailored to three distinct educational grades: elementary, high-school and graduate school. In our first study, human raters assume the role of an \"educator\" to assess model explanations' fit to different educational grades. We find that GPT-4-generated explanations match their intended educational background only 50% of the time, compared to 79% for lay human-curated explanations. In our second study, human raters assume the role of a learner to assess if an explanation fits their own informational needs. Across all educational backgrounds, users deemed GPT-4-generated explanations 20% less suited on average to their informational needs, when compared to explanations curated by lay people.

This study investigates the acceptance of cybernetic avatars in the highly multicultural society of Dubai, with particular emphasis on robotic avatars for customer service. Specifically, we explore how acceptance varies as a function of robot appearance (e.g., android, robotic-looking, cartoonish), deployment settings (e.g., shopping malls, hotels, hospitals), and functional tasks (e.g., providing information, patrolling). To this end, we conducted a large-scale survey with over 1,000 participants. Overall, cybernetic avatars received a high level of acceptance, with physical robot avatars receiving higher acceptance than digital avatars. In terms of appearance, robot avatars with a highly anthropomorphic robotic appearance were the most accepted, followed by cartoonish designs and androids. Animal-like appearances received the lowest level of acceptance. Among the tasks, providing information and guidance was rated as the most valued. Shopping malls, airports, public transport stations, and museums were the settings with the highest acceptance, whereas healthcare-related spaces received lower levels of support. An analysis by community cluster revealed among others that Emirati respondents showed significantly greater acceptance of android appearances compared to the overall sample, while participants from the 'Other Asia' cluster were significantly more accepting of cartoonish appearances. Our study underscores the importance of incorporating citizen feedback into the design and deployment of cybernetic avatars from the early stages to enhance acceptance of this technology in society.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fea\u62dc\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u8d5b\u535a\u683c\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u573a\u666f\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e86\u89e3\u8d5b\u535a\u683c\u5316\u8eab\u5728\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8c03\u67e5\uff081000\u591a\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5916\u89c2\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u4eba\u3001\u5361\u901a\uff09\u3001\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u5546\u573a\u3001\u533b\u9662\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u5bf9\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6570\u5b57\u5316\u8eab\uff1b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4eff\u4eba\u5916\u89c2\u6700\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff1b\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u52a1\u6700\u53d7\u91cd\u89c6\uff1b\u5546\u573a\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u8f83\u4f4e\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6587\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5165\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8d5b\u535a\u683c\u5316\u8eab\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality. Our method enables high-quality, high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction even under memory constraints. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that HRGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in high-resolution novel view synthesis (NVS) and surface reconstruction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "HRGS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u4fee\u526a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863DGS\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u65f63D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u5185\u5b58\u6269\u5c55\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHRGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5757\u4f18\u5316\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u7c97\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5757\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u548c\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u4fee\u526a\uff08IDGP\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHRGS\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff08NVS\uff09\u548c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HRGS\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

While conventional approaches, such as cost-sensitive learning, oversampling, and graph neural networks, provide partial solutions, they suffer from drawbacks like overfitting, label noise, and poor generalization in low-density regions. To address these challenges, we propose QCL-MixNet, a novel Quantum-Informed Contrastive Learning framework augmented with k-nearest neighbor (kNN) guided dynamic mixup for robust classification under imbalance. QCL-MixNet integrates three core innovations: (i) a Quantum Entanglement-inspired layer that models complex feature interactions through sinusoidal transformations and gated attention, (ii) a sample-aware mixup strategy that adaptively interpolates feature representations of semantically similar instances to enhance minority class representation, and (iii) a hybrid loss function that unifies focal reweighting, supervised contrastive learning, triplet margin loss, and variance regularization to improve both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on 18 real-world imbalanced datasets (binary and multi-class) demonstrate that QCL-MixNet consistently outperforms 20 state-of-the-art machine learning, deep learning, and GNN-based baselines in macro-F1 and recall, often by substantial margins. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of each architectural component. Our results establish QCL-MixNet as a new benchmark for tabular imbalance handling in expert systems.

(2) What makes the challenge unique is inherent perturbed terms by semantic paraphasia, which are not exactly related to the target item, hindering the identification process. To address each, we propose robustifying the model from semantically paraphasic errors and enhancing the model with unseen terms with gradient-based selective augmentation. Specifically, the gradient value controls augmented data quality amid semantic errors, while the gradient variance guides the inclusion of unseen but relevant terms.

These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u91cd\u578b\u80a2\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6216\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u5e38\u56e0\u91cd\u578b\u80a2\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08MPC\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08HQP\uff09\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe1.2 m/s\uff0c\u53ef\u62b5\u629760 N\u5916\u529b\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u6237\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91cd\u578b\u80a2\u4f53\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Specifically, UniSpace-3D incorporates three innovative designs: i) a unified representation encoder that leverages the pre-trained CLIP model to map visual and textual features into a unified representation space, effectively bridging the gap between the two modalities; ii) a multi-modal contrastive learning module that further reduces the modality gap; iii) a language-guided query selection module that utilizes the positional and semantic information to identify object candidate points aligned with textual descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniSpace-3D outperforms baseline models by at least 2.24% on the ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D datasets.

Leveraging information asymmetry, AgentSynth constructs subtasks that are simple during generation but significantly more challenging when composed into long-horizon tasks, enabling the creation of over 6,000 diverse and realistic tasks. Our pipeline begins with an LLM-based task proposer guided by a persona, followed by an execution agent that completes the task and logs the trajectory. This process is repeated iteratively to form a sequence of subtasks, which are then summarized by a separate agent into a composite task of controllable difficulty. A key strength of AgentSynth is its ability to precisely modulate task complexity by varying the number of subtasks. Empirical evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents suffer a steep performance drop, from 18% success at difficulty level 1 to just 4% at level 6, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and discriminative power.

However, when a pretrained policy makes errors during deployment, there are limited mechanisms for users to correct its behavior. While collecting additional data for finetuning can address such issues, doing so for each downstream use case is inefficient at deployment. My research proposes an alternative: keeping pretrained policies frozen as a fixed skill repertoire while allowing user interactions to guide behavior generation toward user preferences at inference time. By making pretrained policies steerable, users can help correct policy errors when the model struggles to generalize-without needing to finetune the policy. Specifically, I propose (1) inference-time steering, which leverages user interactions to switch between discrete skills, and (2) task and motion imitation, which enables user interactions to edit continuous motions while satisfying task constraints defined by discrete symbolic plans. These frameworks correct misaligned policy predictions without requiring additional training, maximizing the utility of pretrained models while achieving inference-time user objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u884c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ea0\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u7528\u4f8b\u6536\u96c6\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5207\u6362\u79bb\u6563\u6280\u80fd\uff1b(2) \u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u4eff\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u8f91\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f15\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Specifically, we introduce an implicit 3D representation based on elastic points, which is immune to the interference of original scene point cloud density and achieves the characteristic of uniform distribution. Subsequently, we derive the occupancy grid and normal vector information of the scene from this implicit representation. Finally, with the aid of these two types of information, we obtain descriptors that fuse geometric information from both bird's-eye view (capturing macro-level spatial layouts) and 3D segment (encoding micro-scale surface geometries) perspectives. We conducted extensive experiments on numerous datasets (KITTI, KITTI-360, MulRan, NCLT) across diverse environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our approach strikes an optimal balance between accuracy, runtime, and memory optimization for historical maps, showcasing excellent Resilient and scalability.

However, obtaining high-quality data remains challenging, with data privacy issues presenting a significant hurdle. To address the need for high-quality data. Synthesize data has emerged as a mainstream solution, demonstrating impressive performance in areas such as images, audio, and video. Generating mixed-type data, especially high-quality tabular data, still faces significant challenges. These primarily include its inherent heterogeneous data types, complex inter-variable relationships, and intricate column-wise distributions. In this paper, we introduce CausalDiffTab, a diffusion model-based generative model specifically designed to handle mixed tabular data containing both numerical and categorical features, while being more flexible in capturing complex interactions among variables. We further propose a hybrid adaptive causal regularization method based on the principle of Hierarchical Prior Fusion. This approach adaptively controls the weight of causal regularization, enhancing the model's performance without compromising its generative capabilities.

Automating the key task of visual bridge inspection, classification of defects and building components on pixel level, improves efficiency, increases accuracy and enhances safety in the inspection process and resulting building assessment. Models overtaking this task must cope with an assortment of real-world conditions. They must be robust to variations in image quality, as well as background texture, as defects often appear on surfaces of diverse texture and degree of weathering. dacl10k is the largest and most diverse dataset for real-world concrete bridge inspections. However, the dataset exhibits class imbalance, which leads to notably poor model performance particularly when segmenting fine-grained classes such as cracks and cavities. This work introduces \"synth-dacl\", a compilation of three novel dataset extensions based on synthetic concrete textures. These extensions are designed to balance class distribution in dacl10k and enhance model performance, especially for crack and cavity segmentation. When incorporating the synth-dacl extensions, we observe substantial improvements in model robustness across 15 perturbed test sets.

Building on this framework, we introduce a new SAE training algorithm based on ``bias adaptation'', a technique that adaptively adjusts neural network bias parameters to ensure appropriate activation sparsity.

While models have become proficient at detecting explicit patterns, which typically appear in texts as single remarks referred to as utterances, such as social media posts, malicious actors have shifted toward utilizing implicit influential verbal patterns embedded within conversations. These verbal patterns aim to mentally penetrate the victim's mind in order to influence them, enabling the actor to obtain the desired information through implicit means. This paper presents an improved approach for detecting such implicit influential patterns. Furthermore, the proposed model is capable of identifying the specific locations of these influential elements within a conversation. To achieve this, the existing dataset was augmented using the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art language models. Our designed framework resulted in a 6% improvement in the detection of implicit influential patterns in conversations.

However, many existing approaches emphasize safety or efficiency while overlooking social awareness. This article proposes Learning-Risk Model Predictive Control (LR-MPC), a data-driven navigation algorithm that balances efficiency, safety, and social awareness. LR-MPC consists of two phases: an offline risk learning phase, where a Probabilistic Ensemble Neural Network (PENN) is trained using risk data from a heuristic MPC-based baseline (HR-MPC), and an online adaptive inference phase, where local waypoints are sampled and globally guided by a Multi-RRT planner. Each candidate waypoint is evaluated for risk by PENN, and predictions are filtered using epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to ensure robust decision-making. The safest waypoint is selected as the MPC input for real-time navigation.

While LLM-based conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have attracted attention for their ability to enhance the quality of recommendations, limited research has addressed the implicit integration of recommendations within customer support interactions. In this work, we introduce ImpReSS, an implicit recommender system designed for customer support conversations. ImpReSS operates alongside existing support chatbots, where users report issues and chatbots provide solutions. Based on a customer support conversation, ImpReSS identifies opportunities to recommend relevant solution product categories (SPCs) that help resolve the issue or prevent its recurrence -- thereby also supporting business growth. Unlike traditional CRSs, ImpReSS functions entirely implicitly and does not rely on any assumption of a user's purchasing intent. Our empirical evaluation of ImpReSS's ability to recommend relevant SPCs that can help address issues raised in support conversations shows promising results, including an MRR@1 (and recall@3) of 0.72 (0.89) for general problem solving, 0.82 (0.83) for information security support, and 0.85 (0.67) for cybersecurity troubleshooting.

While unlearning plays a vital role in protecting data privacy, enforcing copyright, and mitigating sociotechnical harms in LLMs, we identify a new vulnerability post-unlearning: unlearning trace detection. We discover that unlearning leaves behind persistent ''fingerprints'' in LLMs, detectable traces in both model behavior and internal representations. These traces can be identified from output responses, even when prompted with forget-irrelevant inputs. Specifically, a simple supervised classifier can reliably determine whether a model has undergone unlearning based solely on its textual outputs. Further analysis shows that these traces are embedded in intermediate activations and propagate nonlinearly to the final layer, forming low-dimensional, learnable manifolds in activation space. Through extensive experiments, we show that forget-relevant prompts enable over 90% accuracy in detecting unlearning traces across all model sizes. Even with forget-irrelevant inputs, large LLMs maintain high detectability, demonstrating the broad applicability of unlearning trace detection. These findings reveal that unlearning leaves measurable signatures, introducing a new risk of reverse-engineering forgotten information when a model is identified as unlearned given an input query.

For example in TRC, we need to understand the temporal semantic differences between the following two questions that are lexically near-identical: \"What finished right before the decision?\" or \"What finished right after the decision?\". To discern the two questions, existing solutions have relied on answer overlaps as a proxy label to contrast similar and dissimilar questions. However, we claim that answer overlap can lead to unreliable results, due to spurious overlaps of two dissimilar questions with coincidentally identical answers. To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that elicits proper reasoning behaviors through a module for predicting time spans of events. We introduce the Timeline Reasoning Network (TRN) operating in a two-step inductive reasoning process: In the first step model initially answers each question with semantic and syntactic information. The next step chains multiple questions on the same event to predict a timeline, which is then used to ground the answers.

Existing methods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction without interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes. Recent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require extensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and develop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while maintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage teacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation using clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a novel geometry and spatially-embedded scene representation and a comprehensive safety curriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors.

This technique is critical in drug discovery and has greatly advanced with recent improvements in computer vision. Inspired by recent developments in non-contrastive Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), this paper provides an initial exploration into training a generalizable feature extractor for cell images using such methods. However, there are two major challenges: 1) There is a large difference between the distributions of cell images and natural images, causing the view-generation process in existing SSL methods to fail; and 2) Unlike typical scenarios where each representation is based on a single image, cell profiling often involves multiple input images, making it difficult to effectively combine all available information. To overcome these challenges, we propose SSLProfiler, a non-contrastive SSL framework specifically designed for cell profiling. We introduce specialized data augmentation and representation post-processing methods tailored to cell images, which effectively address the issues mentioned above and result in a robust feature extractor.

Contemporary approaches, notably diffusion and flow-based models, have achieved solid graph generative performance through constructing a probability path that interpolates between a reference distribution and the data distribution. However, these methods typically model the evolution of individual nodes and edges independently and use linear interpolations to build the path assuming that the data lie in Euclidean space. We show that this is suboptimal given the intrinsic non-Euclidean structure and interconnected patterns of graphs, and it poses risks to the sampling convergence. To build a better probability path, we model the joint evolution of the nodes and edges by representing graphs as connected systems parameterized by Markov random fields (MRF). We then leverage the optimal transport displacement between MRF objects to design the probability path for graph generation. Based on this, we introduce BWFlow, a flow-matching framework for graph generation that respects the underlying geometry of graphs and provides smooth velocities in the probability path. The novel framework can be adapted to both continuous and discrete flow-matching algorithms. Experimental evaluations in plain graph generation and 2D/3D molecule generation validate the effectiveness of BWFlow in graph generation with competitive performance, stable training, and guaranteed sampling convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u968f\u673a\u573a\uff08MRF\uff09\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5BWFlow\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u5efa\u6a21\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7684\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u7684\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4e92\u8054\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91c7\u6837\u6536\u655b\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e3aMRF\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528MRF\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BWFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBWFlow\u5728\u666e\u901a\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u548c2D/3D\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BWFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0a\u91cd\u56fe\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In contrast, expert problem solvers - such as Olympiad or programming contest teams - leverage a rich tapestry of experiences: absorbing mentorship from coaches, developing intuition from past problems, leveraging knowledge of tool usage and library functionality, adapting strategies based on the expertise and experiences of peers, continuously refining their reasoning through trial and error, and learning from other related problems even during competition.

By learning from relevant strategies, code fragments, and abstract reasoning patterns at inference time, Xolver avoids generating solutions from scratch - marking a transition from isolated inference toward experience-aware language agents. Built on both open-weight and proprietary models, Xolver consistently outperforms specialized reasoning agents. Even with lightweight backbones (e.g., QWQ-32B), it often surpasses advanced models including Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3, and o4-mini-high.

This paper presents a novel integration of the Barrier Interior Point Method (BIPM) with factor graphs, implemented as an open-source extension to the widely adopted g2o framework. Our approach introduces specialized inequality factor nodes that encode logarithmic barrier functions, thereby overcoming the quadratic-form limitations of conventional factor graph formulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first g2o-based implementation capable of efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints within a unified optimization backend. We validate the method through a multi-objective adaptive cruise control application for autonomous vehicles.

However, a critical paradox clouds its efficacy: RLVR-tuned models often underperform their base models on the $Pass@K$ metric for solution-finding, leading to the hypothesis that RLVR merely re-weights existing reasoning paths at the cost of reasoning diversity. In this work, we resolve this contradiction by identifying the source of the problem: the $Pass@K$ metric itself is a flawed measure of reasoning, as it credits correct final answers that probably arise from inaccurate or incomplete chains of thought (CoTs). To address this, we introduce a more precise evaluation metric, $CoT$-$Pass@K$, which mandates that both the reasoning path and the final answer be correct. We provide a new theoretical foundation that formalizes how RLVR, unlike traditional RL, is uniquely structured to incentivize logical integrity. Our empirical results are supportive: using $CoT$-$Pass@K$, we observe that RLVR can incentivize the generalization of correct reasoning for all values of $K$. Furthermore, by analyzing the training dynamics, we find that this enhanced reasoning capability emerges early in the training process and smoothly generalizes. Our work provides a clear perspective on the role of RLVR, offers a more reliable method for its evaluation, and confirms its potential to genuinely advance machine reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRLVR\uff08\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\uff1aRLVR\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728$Pass@K$\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a$Pass@K$\u662f\u7f3a\u9677\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807$CoT$-$Pass@K$\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u5747\u6b63\u786e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eRLVR\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u5728\u63d0\u5347LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0$Pass@K$\u6307\u6807\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807$CoT$-$Pass@K$\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u5747\u6b63\u786e\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790RLVR\u5982\u4f55\u6fc0\u52b1\u903b\u8f91\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1RLVR\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528$CoT$-$Pass@K$\u6307\u6807\u540e\uff0cRLVR\u80fd\u6fc0\u52b1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5373\u51fa\u73b0\u5e76\u5e73\u6ed1\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c$CoT$-$Pass@K$\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This makes 360 scene understanding tasks, eg, segmentation and tracking, crucial for appications, such as autonomous driving, robotics. With the recent emergence of foundation models, the community is, however, impeded by the lack of large-scale, labelled real-world datasets. This is caused by the inherent spherical properties, eg, severe distortion in polar regions, and content discontinuities, rendering the annotation costly yet complex. This paper introduces Leader360V, the first large-scale, labeled real-world 360 video datasets for instance segmentation and tracking. Our datasets enjoy high scene diversity, ranging from indoor and urban settings to natural and dynamic outdoor scenes. To automate annotation, we design an automatic labeling pipeline, which subtly coordinates pre-trained 2D segmentors and large language models to facilitate the labeling. The pipeline operates in three novel stages. Specifically, in the Initial Annotation Phase, we introduce a Semantic- and Distortion-aware Refinement module, which combines object mask proposals from multiple 2D segmentors with LLM-verified semantic labels. These are then converted into mask prompts to guide SAM2 in generating distortion-aware masks for subsequent frames. In the Auto-Refine Annotation Phase, missing or incomplete regions are corrected either by applying the SDR again or resolving the discontinuities near the horizontal borders. The Manual Revision Phase finally incorporates LLMs and human annotators to further refine and validate the annotations. Extensive user studies and evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our labeling pipeline.

Existing inverse estimation techniques are often limited by instability, pronounced sensitivity to measurement noise, and difficulty in recovering absolute-scale Young's modulus. This work presents a novel Inverse Elasticity Physics-Informed Neural Network (IE-PINN) specifically designed to robustly reconstruct heterogeneous distributions of elasticity parameters from noisy displacement data based on linear elasticity physics. IE-PINN integrates three distinct neural network architectures dedicated to separately modeling displacement fields, strain fields, and elasticity distributions, thereby significantly enhancing stability and accuracy against measurement noise. Additionally, a two-phase estimation strategy is introduced: the first phase recovers relative spatial distributions of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and the second phase calibrates the absolute scale of Young's modulus using imposed loading boundary conditions.

A learned router computes a distribution over these experts, and assigns input tokens to a small subset. However, without auxiliary balancing mechanisms, routers often converge to using only a few experts, severely limiting model capacity and degrading performance. Most current load balancing mechanisms encourage a distribution over experts that resembles a roughly uniform distribution of experts per token. During training, this can result in inconsistent routing behavior, resulting in the model spending its capacity to learn redundant knowledge.

Integrating external tools, such as calculators and databases, into large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing problem-solving capabilities. Current methods assign a unique token to each tool, enabling LLMs to call tools through token prediction-similar to word generation. However, this approach fails to account for the relationship between tool and word tokens, limiting adaptability within pre-trained LLMs. To address this issue, we propose a novel token learning method that aligns tool tokens with the existing word embedding space from the perspective of initialization, thereby enhancing model performance. We begin by constructing prior token embeddings for each tool based on the tool's name or description, which are used to initialize and regularize the learnable tool token embeddings. This ensures the learned embeddings are well-aligned with the word token space, improving tool call accuracy. We evaluate the method on tasks such as numerical reasoning, knowledge-based question answering, and embodied plan generation using GSM8K-XL, FuncQA, KAMEL, and VirtualHome datasets.

Accepted for publication in 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems", "summary": "Personalization is critical for the advancement of service robots. Robots need to develop tailored understandings of the environments they are put in. Moreover, they need to be aware of changes in the environment to facilitate long-term deployment. Long-term understanding as well as personalization is necessary to execute complex tasks like prepare dinner table or tidy my room. A precursor to such tasks is that of Object Search. Consequently, this paper focuses on locating and searching multiple objects in indoor environments. In this paper, we propose two crucial novelties. Firstly, we propose a novel framework that can enable robots to deduce Personalized Ontologies of indoor environments. Our framework consists of a personalization schema that enables the robot to tune its understanding of ontologies. Secondly, we propose an Adaptive Inferencing strategy. We integrate Dynamic Belief Updates into our approach which improves performance in multi-object search tasks. The cumulative effect of personalization and adaptive inferencing is an improved capability in long-term object search. This framework is implemented on top of a multi-layered semantic map. We conduct experiments in real environments and compare our results against various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we show that personalization can act as a catalyst to enhance the performance of SOTAs.

Despite the typically low performance on ARC, the deep learning paradigm remains the most effective known strategy for generating skillful (state-of-the-art) neural networks (NN) across varied modalities and tasks in vision, language etc. The deep learning paradigm has proven to be able to train these skillful neural networks and learn the abstractions needed in these diverse domains. Our work doubles down on that and continues to leverage this paradigm by incorporating on-the-fly NN training at test time. We demonstrate that fully committing to deep learning's capacity to acquire novel abstractions yields state-of-the-art performance on ARC. Specifically, we treat both the neural network and the optimizer (rather than just a pre-trained network) as integral components of the inference process, fostering generalization to unseen tasks. Concretely, we propose a methodology for training on ARC, starting from pretrained LLMs, and enhancing their ARC reasoning. We also propose Test-Time Fine-Tuning (TTFT) and the Augment Inference Reverse-Augmentation and Vote (AIRV) as effective test-time techniques. We are the first to propose and show deep learning can be used effectively for ARC, showing boosts of up to 260% in accuracy with AIRV and a further 300% boost with TTFT. An early version of this approach secured first place in the 2023 ARCathon competition, while the final version achieved the current best score on the ARC private test-set (58%).

However, they do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific insights due to their black-box nature. In contrast, scientific reasoning distills biological or physical principles from observations and controlled experiments, and quantitatively interprets them with process-based models made of mathematical equations. Yet, process-based models rely on numerous free parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and thus often fit observations poorly in cross-scale predictions. While prior work has embedded process-based models in conventional neural networks, discovering interpretable relationships between parameters in process-based models and input features is still a grand challenge for scientific discovery. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge, further enhancing its interpretability. While the embedded process-based model enforces established scientific knowledge, the encoder reveals new scientific mechanisms and relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants.

Existing approaches face three key challenges: 1) Excessive pre-training cost arising from multi-stage pre-training pipelines, 2) Ineffective spatial-temporal encoding due to manually split 3D rotary positional embeddings that hinder feature interactions, and 3) Imprecise learning objectives in soft-label multi-instance retrieval, which neglect negative pair correlations. In this paper, we introduce EVA02-AT, a suite of EVA02-based video-language foundation models tailored to egocentric video understanding tasks. EVA02-AT first efficiently transfers an image-based CLIP model into a unified video encoder via a single-stage pretraining. Second, instead of applying rotary positional embeddings to isolated dimensions, we introduce spatial-temporal rotary positional embeddings along with joint attention, which can effectively encode both spatial and temporal information on the entire hidden dimension. This joint encoding of spatial-temporal features enables the model to learn cross-axis relationships, which are crucial for accurately modeling motion and interaction in videos. Third, focusing on multi-instance video-language retrieval tasks, we introduce the Symmetric Multi-Similarity (SMS) loss and a novel training framework that advances all soft labels for both positive and negative pairs, providing a more precise learning objective.

To address this hallucination effect, selectively abstaining from answering, called selective generation, provides an effective way for generators to control the hallucination when it is unsure of their answers. However, as selective generators are interacting under non-stochastic environments and having partial feedback from users on selective generation (e.g., thumbs up or down on the selected answer), learning methods for selective generation under such practical setups are crucial but currently missing. To address these limitations, we propose an online learning algorithm for selective generation under partial feedback. In particular, as learning under partial feedback is well-studied by multi-armed bandit problems, we reduce selective generation to bandits and provide a novel conversion lemma from bandits back to selective generation to leverage any known bandit algorithms and theoretical properties. This mainly connects regret guarantees of bandits to false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees of selective generation for controlling hallucination. However, naively exploiting known bandit algorithms and their regret bounds suffers from slow convergence speed in practice due the nature of partial feedback. To overcome this, we exploit a unique structure of arms in selective generation for feedback unlocking, i.e., unlocking unknown feedback from observed feedback. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the efficacy of the proposed online selective generation algorithm under partial feedback over diverse data environment setups, resulting in controlling a desired FDR, while maintaining reasonable selection efficiency, i.e., the ratio of non-abstaining answers, compared to baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u9501\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u865a\u5047\u56de\u7b54\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\u6548\u5e94\uff09\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff08\u5373\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u4e0d\u56de\u7b54\uff09\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u89e3\u9501\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u540e\u6094\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5047\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\uff08FDR\uff09\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236FDR\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\uff08\u975e\u5f03\u7b54\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6548\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm ECPO, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization. ECPO ingeniously eliminates the significant sampling overhead of existing MTPO methods while ensuring the optimization process drives meaningful improvements. To support ECPO, we introduce an LLM-based user simulator, AILO, to simulate user feedback and perform expectation confirmation during conversational recommendations. Experimental results show that ECPO significantly enhances CRA's interaction capabilities, delivering notable improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness over existing MTPO methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aECPO\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u89c6\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165ECPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u671f\u671b\u786e\u8ba4\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6a21\u62df\u5668AILO\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cECPO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6548\u679c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ECPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

It not only involves flight simulation but also requires the learning of a great deal of professional aviation theory knowledge. In the existing training system, the knowledge is mainly imparted by the the instructors. However, the number of instructors is limited and the professional answers obtained from the Internet are not accurate enough, resulting in low training efficiency. To address this, we introduced LLM, but the basic pre-trained model cannot provide accurate answers to professional fields, so we fine-tuned it. Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) risk generating superficially plausible but factually incorrect responses due to insufficient data coverage. To address this, we employ Direct Preference Optimization(DPO). This paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented LLM Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization(RALA-DPO). We select open source pre-trained LLM Qwen and adapt it to aviation theory training through DPO-based domain alignment. Simultaneously, to mitigate hallucinations caused by training data biases, knowledge obsolescence, or domain knowledge gaps, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) technology that combines generative and retrieval models.

This work examines the sensitivity of widely used reference-based metrics in relation to the choice of reference sets, analyzing three diverse multi-reference summarization datasets: SummEval, GUMSum, and DUC2004. We demonstrate that many popular metrics exhibit significant instability. This instability is particularly concerning for n-gram-based metrics like ROUGE, where model rankings vary depending on the reference sets, undermining the reliability of model comparisons. We also collect human judgments on LLM outputs for genre-diverse data and examine their correlation with metrics to supplement existing findings beyond newswire summaries, finding weak-to-no correlation.

While many approaches integrate pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) with specialized navigation architectures, the fundamental question remains: can these pretrained embeddings alone successfully guide navigation without additional fine-tuning or specialized modules? We present a minimalist framework that decouples this question by training a behavior cloning policy directly on frozen vision-language embeddings from demonstrations collected by a privileged expert. Our approach achieves a 74% success rate in navigation to language-specified targets, compared to 100% for the state-aware expert, though requiring 3.2 times more steps on average. This performance gap reveals that pretrained embeddings effectively support basic language grounding but struggle with long-horizon planning and spatial reasoning. By providing this empirical baseline, we highlight both the capabilities and limitations of using foundation models as drop-in representations for embodied tasks, offering critical insights for robotics researchers facing practical design tradeoffs between system complexity and performance in resource-constrained scenarios.

In this work, we show that this capability is significantly degraded during conventional fine-tuning, leading to undesired behaviors such as hallucinations. To address this novel but highly practical problem, we propose SEAT, a simple and effective fine-tuning approach that preserves both fine-tuning performance and the model's inherent ability to acknowledge its ignorance. SEAT integrates two key components: (1) sparse training that constrains activation drift, and (2) a novel entity perturbation method with KL-divergence regularization, designed to counter knowledge entanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that SEAT significantly outperforms baselines in preserving ignorance awareness while retaining fine-tuning performance, offering a more robust solution for LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEAT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u65e0\u77e5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9000\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u4e0d\u826f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "SEAT\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u9650\u5236\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5e26KL\u6563\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea0\u7f20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEAT\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u65e0\u77e5\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SEAT\u4e3aLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u3002"}}

The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection", "categories": ["cs.AI", "cs.SE"], "comment": null, "summary": "As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance.

We study sparse transformers not through a lens of efficiency but rather in terms of learnability and generalization. Empirically studying a range of attention mechanisms, we find that input-dependent sparse attention models appear to converge faster and generalize better than standard attention models, while input-agnostic sparse attention models show no such benefits -- a phenomenon that is robust across architectural and optimization hyperparameter choices. This can be interpreted as demonstrating that concentrating a model's \"semantic focus\" with respect to the tokens currently being considered (in the form of input-dependent sparse attention) accelerates learning. We develop a theoretical characterization of the conditions that explain this behavior. We establish a connection between the stability of the standard softmax and the loss function's Lipschitz properties, then show how sparsity affects the stability of the softmax and the subsequent convergence and generalization guarantees resulting from the attention mechanism. This allows us to theoretically establish that input-agnostic sparse attention does not provide any benefits.

However, this integration leads to problems of asynchronous systems, which arise from the distinct characteristics inherent in GMs and SMs. To tackle this challenge, we propose NetRoller, an adapter that incorporates a set of novel mechanisms to facilitate the seamless integration of GMs and specialized driving models. Specifically, our mechanisms for interfacing the asynchronous GMs and SMs are organized into three key stages. NetRoller first harvests semantically rich and computationally efficient representations from the reasoning processes of LLMs using an early stopping mechanism, which preserves critical insights on driving context while maintaining low overhead. It then applies learnable query embeddings, nonsensical embeddings, and positional layer embeddings to facilitate robust and efficient cross-modality translation. At last, it employs computationally efficient Query Shift and Feature Shift mechanisms to enhance the performance of SMs through few-epoch fine-tuning. Based on the mechanisms formalized in these three stages, NetRoller enables specialized driving models to operate at their native frequencies while maintaining situational awareness of the GM. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating GM through NetRoller significantly improves human similarity and safety in planning tasks, and it also achieves noticeable precision improvements in detection and mapping tasks for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Furthermore, we propose a semi-automated dataset construction paradigm that collects user action sequences from natural interactions via RPA tools and then generate corresponding step and task descriptions for these actions with the assistance of MLLMs. This paradigm significantly reduces annotation time cost by a factor of over 19 times. Finally, we assess state-of-the-art GUI agents using the GUI-Robust dataset, revealing their substantial performance degradation in abnormal scenarios. We anticipate that our work will highlight the importance of robustness in GUI agents and inspires more future research in this direction.

In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence have spurred the development of automatic remote sensing semantic segmentation methods. However, the existing semantic segmentation methods focus on distinguishing spectral characteristics of different objects while ignoring the differences in the elevation of the different targets. This results in land cover misclassification in complex scenarios involving shadow occlusion and spectral confusion. In this paper, we introduce a depth prompting two-dimensional (2D) remote sensing semantic segmentation framework (DepthSeg). It automatically models depth/height information from 2D remote sensing images and integrates it into the semantic segmentation framework to mitigate the effects of spectral confusion and shadow occlusion. During the feature extraction phase of DepthSeg, we introduce a lightweight adapter to enable cost-effective fine-tuning of the large-parameter vision transformer encoder pre-trained by natural images. In the depth prompting phase, we propose a depth prompter to model depth/height features explicitly. In the semantic prediction phase, we introduce a semantic classification decoder that couples the depth prompts with high-dimensional land-cover features, enabling accurate extraction of land-cover types. Experiments on the LiuZhou dataset validate the advantages of the DepthSeg framework in land cover mapping tasks.

Recently, the term 'swarm' has been extended to describe AI systems like OpenAI's Swarm, where large language models (LLMs) act as collaborative agents. This paper contrasts traditional swarm algorithms with LLM-driven swarms exploring how decentralization, scalability, and emergence are redefined in modern artificial intelligence (AI). We implement and compare both paradigms using Boids and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), evaluating latency, resource usage, and behavioral accuracy. The suitability of both cloud-based and local LLMs is assessed for the agent-based use in swarms. Although LLMs offer powerful reasoning and abstraction capabilities, they introduce new constraints in computation and coordination that challenge traditional notions of swarm design.

Typically, the inner product performed in the Euclidean space calculates the algebraic\n  similarity rather than the semantic similarity, which results in undesired attention output and a decrease in fusion performance.\n  While the balance of low-level details and high-level semantics should be considered in infrared and visible image fusion task. To\n  address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Grassmann manifold for infrared and visible\n  image fusion (GrFormer). Specifically, our method constructs a low-rank subspace mapping through projection constraints on the\n  Grassmann manifold, compressing attention features into subspaces of varying rank levels. This forces the features to decouple into\n  high-frequency details (local low-rank) and low-frequency semantics (global low-rank), thereby achieving multi-scale semantic\n  fusion. Additionally, to effectively integrate the significant information, we develop a cross-modal fusion strategy (CMS) based on\n  a covariance mask to maximise the complementary properties between different modalities and to suppress the features with high\n  correlation, which are deemed redundant.

The SF-HLDM framework enables autonomous driving AI agents dynamically adjusts decision parameters to maintain safety margins and adhering to contextually appropriate driving behaviors at the same time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff08SF-HLDM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8212\u9002\u4e14\u793e\u4f1a\u517c\u5bb9\u5730\u884c\u9a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u901a\u6d41\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08S-TA\uff09\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DERL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "SF-HLDM\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76AI\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u51b3\u7b56\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u88d5\u5ea6\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, combining DDIM inversion with conditional generation via classifier-free guidance (CFG). However, standard CFG applies a single global weight across all conditioning variables, which can lead to poor identity preservation and spurious attribute changes - a phenomenon known as attribute amplification. To address this, we propose Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), a flexible and model-agnostic framework that introduces group-wise conditioning control. DCFG builds on an attribute-split embedding strategy that disentangles semantic inputs, enabling selective guidance on user-defined attribute groups. For counterfactual generation, we partition attributes into intervened and invariant sets based on a causal graph and apply distinct guidance to each.

To fix this, we ran a thorough study - it included seven well-known GNN architectures. We also used a large group of 30 single plus mixed loss functions. The study looked at both inductive and transductive settings. Our evaluation spanned three distinct real-world datasets, assessing performance in both inductive and transductive settings using 21 comprehensive evaluation metrics. From these extensive results (detailed in supplementary information 1 \\& 2), we meticulously analyzed the top ten model-loss combinations for each metric based on their average rank. Our findings reveal that, especially for the inductive case: 1) Hybrid loss functions generally yield superior and more robust performance compared to single loss functions, indicating the benefit of multi-objective optimization. 2) The GIN architecture always showed the highest-level average performance, especially with Cross-Entropy loss. 3) Although some combinations had overall lower average ranks, models such as GAT, particularly with certain hybrid losses, demonstrated incredible specialized strengths, maximizing the most top-1 results among the individual metrics, emphasizing subtle strengths for particular task demands. 4) On the other hand, the MPNN architecture typically lagged behind the scenarios it was tested against.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u4e86GNN\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5f52\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cGIN\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800cMPNN\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76GNN\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f307\u79cdGNN\u67b6\u6784\u548c30\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u75283\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c21\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0cGIN\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cMPNN\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9GNN\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cGIN\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u9996\u9009\u3002"}}

Yet this convenience raises urgent concerns about the safety, robustness, and behavioral consistency of the underlying prompts, along with the pressing challenge of preventing those prompts from being exposed to user's attempts. In this paper, we propose the ''Doppelg\u00e4nger method'' to demonstrate the risk of an agent being hijacked, thereby exposing system instructions and internal information. Next, we define the ''Prompt Alignment Collapse under Adversarial Transfer (PACAT)'' level to evaluate the vulnerability to this adversarial transfer attack.

In this work, we propose a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, guided by a vision-language model (VLM). Our method is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or finetuning. Instead, we guide the generation by optimizing text prompts based on an assumed causal graph, addressing the challenge of latent space control in LDMs. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Our results demonstrate that causally faithful video counterfactuals can be effectively generated within the learned distribution of LDMs through prompt-based causal steering.

However, exact computation is highly expensive, and real-world TBC distributions are extremely imbalanced. The severe imbalance leads learning-based models to overfit to zero-centrality nodes, resulting in inaccurate TBC predictions and failure to identify truly central nodes. Existing graph neural network (GNN) methods either fail to handle such imbalance or ignore temporal dependencies altogether. To address these issues, we propose a scalable and inductive contrastive learning-based GNN (CLGNN) for accurate and efficient TBC prediction. CLGNN builds an instance graph to preserve path validity and temporal order, then encodes structural and temporal features using dual aggregation, i.e., mean and edge-to-node multi-head attention mechanisms, enhanced by temporal path count and time encodings. A stability-based clustering-guided contrastive module (KContrastNet) is introduced to separate high-, median-, and low-centrality nodes in representation space, mitigating class imbalance, while a regression module (ValueNet) estimates TBC values. CLGNN also supports multiple optimal path definitions to accommodate diverse temporal semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CLGNN across diverse benchmarks.

We explain both phenomena through the lens of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) scaling theory. Building on these observations, we propose LongLLaDA, a training-free method that integrates LLaDA with the NTK-based RoPE extrapolation. Our results validate that established extrapolation scaling laws remain effective for extending the context windows of diffusion LLMs. Furthermore, we identify long-context tasks where diffusion LLMs outperform auto-regressive LLMs and others where they fall short.

A central challenge in real-world assistive teleoperation is for the robot to infer a wide range of human intentions from user control inputs and to assist users with correct actions. Existing methods are either confined to simple, predefined scenarios or restricted to task-specific data distributions at training, limiting their support for real-world assistance. We introduce Casper, an assistive teleoperation system that leverages commonsense knowledge embedded in pre-trained visual language models (VLMs) for real-time intent inference and flexible skill execution. Casper incorporates an open-world perception module for a generalized understanding of novel objects and scenes, a VLM-powered intent inference mechanism that leverages commonsense reasoning to interpret snippets of teleoperated user input, and a skill library that expands the scope of prior assistive teleoperation systems to support diverse, long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks. Extensive empirical evaluation, including human studies and system ablations, demonstrates that Casper improves task performance, reduces human cognitive load, and achieves higher user satisfaction than direct teleoperation and assistive teleoperation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Casper\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6280\u80fd\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f85\u52a9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u63a8\u65ad\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u786e\u534f\u52a9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u573a\u666f\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "Casper\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCasper\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u8f85\u52a9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Casper\u901a\u8fc7\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6280\u80fd\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f85\u52a9\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

By systematically analyzing both single-attribute imbalance and compositional attribute imbalance, we reveal how the rarity of attributes affects model performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose adjusting the sampling probability of samples based on the rarity of their compositional attributes. This strategy is further integrated with various data augmentation techniques (such as CutMix, Fmix, and SaliencyMix) to enhance the model's ability to represent rare attributes.

This has led to a proliferation of expert models and adapters, often shared via platforms like HuggingFace and AdapterHub. To leverage these resources, numerous model upcycling methods have emerged, enabling the reuse of fine-tuned models in multi-task systems. A natural pipeline has thus formed to harness the benefits of transfer learning and amortize sunk training costs: models are pre-trained on general data, fine-tuned on specific tasks, and then upcycled into more general-purpose systems. A prevailing assumption is that improvements at one stage of this pipeline propagate downstream, leading to gains at subsequent steps. In this work, we challenge that assumption by examining how expert fine-tuning affects model upcycling. We show that long fine-tuning of experts that optimizes for their individual performance leads to degraded merging performance, both for fully fine-tuned and LoRA-adapted models, and to worse downstream results when LoRA adapters are upcycled into MoE layers. We trace this degradation to the memorization of a small set of difficult examples that dominate late fine-tuning steps and are subsequently forgotten during merging.

Measuring Test-Time Learning Ability in LLMs with Human Comparison", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": null, "summary": "As evaluation designs of large language models may shape our trajectory toward artificial general intelligence, comprehensive and forward-looking assessment is essential. Existing benchmarks primarily assess static knowledge, while intelligence also entails the ability to rapidly learn from experience. To this end, we advocate for the evaluation of Test-time Learning, the capacity to improve performance in experience-based, reasoning-intensive tasks during test time. In this work, we propose semantic games as effective testbeds for evaluating test-time learning, due to their resistance to saturation and inherent demand for strategic reasoning. We introduce an objective evaluation framework that compares model performance under both limited and cumulative experience settings, and contains four forms of experience representation.

By leveraging self-supervised learning, Sparsh-X fuses these modalities into a unified representation that captures physical properties useful for robot manipulation tasks. We study how to effectively integrate real-world touch representations for both imitation learning and tactile adaptation of sim-trained policies, showing that Sparsh-X boosts policy success rates by 63% over an end-to-end model using tactile images and improves robustness by 90% in recovering object states from touch. Finally, we benchmark Sparsh-X ability to make inferences about physical properties, such as object-action identification, material-quantity estimation, and force estimation.

Prominent systems include Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) or DeepProbLog, which offer neural predicates and end-to-end learning. The versatility of systems like LTNs and DeepProbLog, however, makes them less efficient in simpler settings, for instance, for discriminative machine learning, in particular in domains with many constants. Therefore, we follow a different approach: We propose to enhance symbolic machine learning schemes by giving them access to neural embeddings. In the present paper, we show this for TILDE and embeddings of constants used by TILDE in similarity predicates. The approach can be fine-tuned by further refining the embeddings depending on the symbolic theory. In experiments in three real-world domain, we show that this simple, yet effective, approach outperforms all other baseline methods in terms of the F1 score.

To address these limitations, we first introduce a new large-scale rich video human motion 2D dataset (Motion2D-Video-150K) comprising 150,000 video sequences. Motion2D-Video-150K features a balanced distribution of diverse single-character and, crucially, double-character interactive actions, each paired with detailed textual descriptions. Building upon this dataset, we propose a novel diffusion-based rich video human motion2D generation (RVHM2D) model. RVHM2D incorporates an enhanced textual conditioning mechanism utilizing either dual text encoders (CLIP-L/B) or T5-XXL with both global and local features. We devise a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained with a standard diffusion objective, and then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning with an FID-based reward to further enhance motion realism and text alignment.

However, this structure belies a challenge we refer to as predictive equivalence: a given tree's decision boundary can be represented by many different decision trees. The presence of models with identical decision boundaries but different evaluation processes makes model selection challenging. The models will have different variable importance and behave differently in the presence of missing values, but most optimization procedures will arbitrarily choose one such model to return. We present a boolean logical representation of decision trees that does not exhibit predictive equivalence and is faithful to the underlying decision boundary. We apply our representation to several downstream machine learning tasks. Using our representation, we show that decision trees are surprisingly robust to test-time missingness of feature values; we address predictive equivalence's impact on quantifying variable importance; and we present an algorithm to optimize the cost of reaching predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u56e0\u5176\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\u800c\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u7f3a\u5931\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u5bf9\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Verifying whether a specific LLM was trained on particular data instances or an entire dataset is extremely challenging. Dataset watermarking addresses this by embedding identifiable modifications in training data to detect unauthorized use. However, existing methods often lack stealth, making them relatively easy to detect and remove. In light of these limitations, we propose LexiMark, a novel watermarking technique designed for text and documents, which embeds synonym substitutions for carefully selected high-entropy words. Our method aims to enhance an LLM's memorization capabilities on the watermarked text without altering the semantic integrity of the text. As a result, the watermark is difficult to detect, blending seamlessly into the text with no visible markers, and is resistant to removal due to its subtle, contextually appropriate substitutions that evade automated and manual detection. We evaluated our method using baseline datasets from recent studies and seven open-source models: LLaMA-1 7B, LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Pythia 6.9B, as well as three smaller variants from the Pythia family (160M, 410M, and 1B).

While recent generative frameworks can automatically synthesize task settings, such as 3D scenes and reward functions, they have not yet addressed the challenge of tool-use scenarios. Simply retrieving human-designed tools might not be ideal since many tools (e.g., a rolling pin) are difficult for robotic manipulators to handle. Furthermore, existing tool design approaches either rely on predefined templates with limited parameter tuning or apply generic 3D generation methods that are not optimized for tool creation. To address these limitations, we propose RobotSmith, an automated pipeline that leverages the implicit physical knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) alongside the more accurate physics provided by physics simulations to design and use tools for robotic manipulation. Our system (1) iteratively proposes tool designs using collaborative VLM agents, (2) generates low-level robot trajectories for tool use, and (3) jointly optimizes tool geometry and usage for task performance. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of manipulation tasks involving rigid, deformable, and fluid objects. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both task success rate and overall performance. Notably, our approach achieves a 50.0\\% average success rate, significantly surpassing other baselines such as 3D generation (21.4%) and tool retrieval (11.1%).

To support scalable and transferable analysis across diverse geographies and contexts, there is a need for a generalizable foundation model for spatiotemporal data.

This vision paper advocates for a new class of spatial foundation models that integrate geolocation semantics with human mobility across multiple scales. Central to our vision is a shift from modeling discrete points of interest to understanding places: dynamic, context-rich regions shaped by human behavior and mobility that may comprise many places of interest. We identify key gaps in adaptability, scalability, and multi-granular reasoning, and propose research directions focused on modeling places and enabling efficient learning.

However, previous works primarily utilized full-precision experts during sparse up-cycling. Despite they show superior performance on end tasks, the large amount of experts introduces higher memory footprint, which poses significant challenges for the deployment on edge devices. In this work, we propose MoTE, a scalable and memory-efficient approach to train Mixture-of-Ternary-Experts models from dense checkpoint. Instead of training fewer high-precision experts, we propose to train more low-precision experts during up-cycling. Specifically, we use the pre-trained FFN as a shared expert and train ternary routed experts with parameters in {-1, 0, 1}. Extensive experiments show that our approach has promising scaling trend along model size. MoTE achieves comparable performance to full-precision baseline MoE-LLaVA while offering lower memory footprint. Furthermore, our approach is compatible with post-training quantization methods and the advantage further amplifies when memory-constraint goes lower. Given the same amount of expert memory footprint of 3.4GB and combined with post-training quantization, MoTE outperforms MoE-LLaVA by a gain of 4.3% average accuracy on end tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for memory-constrained devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMoTE\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u591a\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff08MoEs\uff09\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u56e0\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684FFN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5171\u4eab\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u8def\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u4e3a{-1, 0, 1}\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "MoTE\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebfMoE-LLaVA\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "MoTE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this position paper, we argue that commonly used benchmarks undervalue the generalization capabilities of programmatic representations. We analyze the experiments of four papers from the literature and show that neural policies, which were shown not to generalize, can generalize as effectively as programmatic policies on OOD problems. This is achieved with simple changes in the neural policies training pipeline. Namely, we show that simpler neural architectures with the same type of sparse observation used with programmatic policies can help attain OOD generalization. Another modification we have shown to be effective is the use of reward functions that allow for safer policies (e.g., agents that drive slowly can generalize better).

Attackers can exploit this by inducing excessive output, leading to resource exhaustion and service degradation. Prior energy-latency attacks aim to increase generation time by broadly shifting the output token distribution away from the EOS token, but they neglect the influence of token-level Part-of-Speech (POS) characteristics on EOS and sentence-level structural patterns on output counts, limiting their efficacy. To address this, we propose LingoLoop, an attack designed to induce MLLMs to generate excessively verbose and repetitive sequences. First, we find that the POS tag of a token strongly affects the likelihood of generating an EOS token. Based on this insight, we propose a POS-Aware Delay Mechanism to postpone EOS token generation by adjusting attention weights guided by POS information. Second, we identify that constraining output diversity to induce repetitive loops is effective for sustained generation. We introduce a Generative Path Pruning Mechanism that limits the magnitude of hidden states, encouraging the model to produce persistent loops. Extensive experiments demonstrate LingoLoop can increase generated tokens by up to 30 times and energy consumption by a comparable factor on models like Qwen2.5-VL-3B, consistently driving MLLMs towards their maximum generation limits. These findings expose significant MLLMs' vulnerabilities, posing challenges for their reliable deployment.

Extensive evaluation on CIFAR-10 demonstrates that our IG-augmented knowledge distillation achieves 92.6% testing accuracy with a 4.1x compression factor-a significant 1.1 percentage point improvement ($p<0.001$) over non-distilled models (91.5%). This compression reduces inference time from 140 ms to 13 ms. Our method precomputes IG maps before training, transforming substantial runtime costs into a one-time preprocessing step. Our comprehensive experiments include: (1) comparisons with attention transfer, revealing complementary benefits when combined with our approach; (2) Monte Carlo simulations confirming statistical robustness; (3) systematic evaluation of compression factor versus accuracy trade-offs across a wide range (2.2x-1122x); and (4) validation on an ImageNet subset aligned with CIFAR-10 classes, demonstrating generalisability beyond the initial dataset.

We identify a core aspect of this issue as \"invalid thinking\" -- models tend to repeatedly double-check their work after having derived the correct answer. To address this specific inefficiency, we move beyond the general principles of Efficacy and Efficiency to propose two new, fine-grained principles: Brevity, which advocates for eliminating redundancy, and Sufficiency, which ensures critical reasoning steps are preserved. Guided by these principles, we introduce LC-R1, a post-training method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). LC-R1 employs a novel combination of a Length Reward for overall conciseness and a Compress Reward that is specifically designed to remove the invalid portion of the thinking process. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LC-R1 achieves a significant reduction in sequence length (~50%) with only a marginal (~2%) drop in accuracy, achieving a favorable trade-off point on the Pareto frontier that prioritizes high compression.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable \"code agent\" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task.

Traditional IEs, typically pre-trained on the target dataset, are inherently dataset-dependent. Foundation models (FMs) offer a promising alternative, potentially mitigating this limitation. This work investigates two key questions: (1) Can FM-based subset selection outperform traditional IE-based methods across diverse datasets? (2) Do all FMs perform equally well as IEs for subset selection? Extensive experiments uncovered surprising insights: FMs consistently outperform traditional IEs on fine-grained datasets, whereas their advantage diminishes on coarse-grained datasets with noisy labels.

In this work, we introduce GG (Guaranteed Guess), an ISA-centric transpilation pipeline that combines the translation power of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with the rigor of established software testing constructs. Our method generates candidate translations using an LLM from one ISA to another, and embeds such translations within a software-testing framework to build quantifiable confidence in the translation. We evaluate our GG approach over two diverse datasets, enforce high code coverage (>98%) across unit tests, and achieve functional/semantic correctness of 99% on HumanEval programs and 49% on BringupBench programs, respectively. Further, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art Rosetta 2 framework on Apple Silicon, showcasing 1.73x faster runtime performance, 1.47x better energy efficiency, and 2.41x better memory usage for our transpiled code, demonstrating the effectiveness of GG for real-world CISC-to-RISC translation tasks.

This reduces dependence on potentially erroneous transcriptions. Second, the Contrastive Complementary Module employs contrastive learning to align erroneous text features with corresponding speech features, ensuring robust performance even when transcription errors dominate.

Most existing methods depend on hand-crafted features, key frames like onset, apex, and offset frames, or deep networks limited by small-scale and low-diversity datasets. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end micro-action-aware deep learning framework with advantages from transformer, graph convolution, and vanilla convolution. In particular, we propose a novel F5C block composed of fully-connected convolution and channel correspondence convolution to directly extract local-global features from a sequence of raw frames, without the prior knowledge of key frames. The transformer-style fully-connected convolution is proposed to extract local features while maintaining global receptive fields, and the graph-style channel correspondence convolution is introduced to model the correlations among feature patterns. Moreover, MER, optical flow estimation, and facial landmark detection are jointly trained by sharing the local-global features. The two latter tasks contribute to capturing facial subtle action information for MER, which can alleviate the impact of insufficient training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on CASME II, SAMM, and SMIC benchmarks, (ii) works well for optical flow estimation and facial landmark detection, and (iii) can capture facial subtle muscle actions in local regions associated with MEs.

Our aggregation mechanism fuses continuous moral acceptability scores (beyond binary labels) into a collective probability, weighting contributions by model reliability.

In real-world dynamic environments, such as cyber-physical systems, this assumption often breaks down due to delays in the interaction between the agent and the system. These delays can vary stochastically over time and are typically unobservable, meaning they are unknown when deciding on an action. Existing methods deal with this uncertainty conservatively by assuming a known fixed upper bound on the delay, even if the delay is often much lower. In this work, we introduce the interaction layer, a general framework that enables agents to adaptively and seamlessly handle unobservable and time-varying delays. Specifically, the agent generates a matrix of possible future actions to handle both unpredictable delays and lost action packets sent over networks. Building on this framework, we develop a model-based algorithm, Actor-Critic with Delay Adaptation (ACDA), which dynamically adjusts to delay patterns.

In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic evaluation of their complex reasoning ability within spatial contexts remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' spatial intelligence through video-based reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises nearly 1K video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene and captured by video. By carefully designing questions and corresponding 3D scenes, our benchmark ensures that solving the questions requires both spatial comprehension for extracting information and high-level reasoning for deriving solutions, making it a challenging benchmark for evaluating VLMs. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine. This engine, leveraging multiple specialized LLM agents, can generate realistic 3D scenes from abstract math problems, ensuring faithfulness to the original descriptions.

Using Large Language Models for Coding German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": "to appear in Survey Research Methods", "summary": "The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u5fb7\u8bed\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eLLM\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22LLMs\u5728\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fb7\u8bed\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cdLLMs\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u8868\u73b0\u6ee1\u610f\uff1b\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56LLM\uff1b\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9700\u6743\u8861\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Addressing the core challenge of autonomous UAV landing in complex and unknown environments, this study innovatively leverages the depth-normal synergy prediction capabilities of the Metric3D V2 model to construct an end-to-end safe landing zones (SLZ) estimation framework. By introducing a safe zone segmentation branch, we transform the landing zone estimation task into a binary semantic segmentation problem. The model is fine-tuned and annotated using the WildUAV dataset from a UAV perspective, while a cross-domain evaluation dataset is constructed to validate the model's robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that VisLanding significantly enhances the accuracy of safe zone identification through a depth-normal joint optimization mechanism, while retaining the zero-shot generalization advantages of Metric3D V2. The proposed method exhibits superior generalization and robustness in cross-domain testing compared to other approaches. Furthermore, it enables the estimation of landing zone area by integrating predicted depth and normal information, providing critical decision-making support for practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VisLanding\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee3D\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6-\u6cd5\u7ebf\u534f\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u533a\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u533a\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Metric3D V2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6-\u6cd5\u7ebf\u534f\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u533a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u5143\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f7f\u7528WildUAV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "VisLanding\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u533a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86Metric3D V2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VisLanding\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6-\u6cd5\u7ebf\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5b89\u5168\u7740\u9646\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

These methods have shown promise in identifying behaviours such as deception and unsafe completions, but a critical open question remains: can LLMs learn to evade such monitors? To study this, we introduce RL-Obfuscation, in which LLMs are finetuned via reinforcement learning to bypass latent-space monitors while maintaining coherent generations. We apply RL-Obfuscation to LLMs ranging from 7B to 14B parameters and evaluate evasion success against a suite of monitors. We find that token-level latent-space monitors are highly vulnerable to this attack. More holistic monitors, such as max-pooling or attention-based probes, remain robust. Moreover, we show that adversarial policies trained to evade a single static monitor generalise to unseen monitors of the same type.

AGENTSAFE simulates realistic agent-environment interactions within a simulation sandbox and incorporates a novel adapter module that bridges the gap between high-level VLM outputs and low-level embodied controls.

So the question remains: how can machines adapt quickly? Despite a lot of progress on model adaptation to facilitate continual and federated learning, as well as model merging, editing, unlearning, etc., little is known about the mechanisms by which machines can naturally learn to adapt in a similar way as humans and animals. Here, we show that all such adaptation methods can be seen as different ways of `correcting' the approximate posteriors. More accurate posteriors lead to smaller corrections, which in turn imply quicker adaptation. The result is obtained by using a dual-perspective of the Bayesian Learning Rule of Khan and Rue (2023) where interference created during adaptation is characterized by the natural-gradient mismatch over the past data.

The model's outputs are evaluated through linguistic analysis, sentiment scoring, and human annotation, with particular attention to credibility and rhetorical alignment with the original discourse. The results indicate that, when trained on partisan data, LLMs are capable of producing highly plausible and provocative comments, often indistinguishable from those written by humans.

However, developers usually face challenges in analyzing the effectiveness of GraphRAG on their dataset due to GraphRAG's complex information processing pipeline and the overwhelming amount of LLM invocations involved during graph construction and query, which limits GraphRAG interpretability and accessibility. This research proposes a visual analysis framework that helps RAG developers identify critical recalls of GraphRAG and trace these recalls through the GraphRAG pipeline.

The background can be specified by natural images (image-based relighting) or generated from unlimited text prompts (text-based relighting). Existing studies primarily focus on image-based relighting, while with scant exploration into text-based scenarios. Some works employ intricate disentanglement pipeline designs relying on environment maps to provide relevant information, which grapples with the expensive data cost required for intrinsic decomposition and light source. Other methods take this task as an image translation problem and perform pixel-level transformation with autoencoder architecture. While these methods have achieved decent harmonization effects, they struggle to generate realistic and natural light interaction effects between the foreground and background. To alleviate these challenges, we reorganize the input data into a unified format and leverage the semantic prior provided by the pretrained diffusion model to facilitate the generation of natural results. Moreover, we propose a Position-Guided Light Adapter (PGLA) that condenses light information from different directions in the background into designed light query embeddings, and modulates the foreground with direction-biased masked attention. In addition, we present a post-processing module named Spectral Foreground Fixer (SFF) to adaptively reorganize different frequency components of subject and relighted background, which helps enhance the consistency of foreground appearance.

We address this gap by providing comprehensive proofs. First, we prove a sufficient condition for a robust L2O model with homogeneous convergence rates over all In-Distribution (InD) instances. We assume an L2O model achieves robustness for an InD scenario. Based on our proposed methodology of aligning OOD problems to InD problems, we also demonstrate that the L2O model's convergence rate in OOD scenarios will deteriorate by an equation of the L2O model's input features. Moreover, we propose an L2O model with a concise gradient-only feature construction and a novel gradient-based history modeling method. Numerical simulation demonstrates that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline in both InD and OOD scenarios and achieves up to 10 $\\times$ convergence speedup.

To mitigate these gaps, we propose GuiLoMo, a fine-grained layer-wise expert numbers and ranks allocation strategy with GuidedSelection Vectors (GSVs). GSVs are learned via a prior bilevel optimization process to capture both model- and task-specific needs, and are then used to allocate optimal expert numbers and ranks. Experiments on three backbone models across diverse benchmarks show that GuiLoMo consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines.

However, classical models like the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) are fundamentally limited by their parsimonious and single-regime structure. They fail to capture the multi-modal nature of human driving, where a single driving state (e.g., speed, relative speed, and gap) can elicit many different driver actions. This forces the model to average across distinct behaviors, reducing its fidelity and making its parameters difficult to interpret. To overcome this, we introduce a regime-switching framework that allows driving behavior to be governed by different IDM parameter sets, each corresponding to an interpretable behavioral mode. This design enables the model to dynamically switch between interpretable behavioral modes, rather than averaging across diverse driving contexts. We instantiate the framework using a Factorial Hidden Markov Model with IDM dynamics (FHMM-IDM), which explicitly separates intrinsic driving regimes (e.g., aggressive acceleration, steady-state following) from external traffic scenarios (e.g., free-flow, congestion, stop-and-go) through two independent latent Markov processes. Bayesian inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to jointly estimate the regime-specific parameters, transition dynamics, and latent state trajectories. Experiments on the HighD dataset demonstrate that FHMM-IDM uncovers interpretable structure in human driving, effectively disentangling internal driver actions from contextual traffic conditions and revealing dynamic regime-switching patterns.

Recent machine learning methods have improved risk estimation (i.e., predicting the likelihood of disease progression) and predictive modelling (i.e., the forecasting of future outcomes based on current data) using medical images, but clinical adoption remains limited due to their lack of interpretability. Existing approaches that generate future images for risk estimation are complex and impractical. Additionally, previous methods fail to localize anatomical knee landmarks, limiting interpretability. We address these gaps with a new interpretable machine learning method to estimate the risk of knee OA progression via multi-task predictive modelling that classifies future knee OA severity and predicts anatomical knee landmarks from efficiently generated high-quality future images. Such image generation is achieved by leveraging a diffusion model in a class-conditioned latent space to forecast disease progression, offering a visual representation of how particular health conditions may evolve. Applied to the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset, our approach improves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 2\\%, achieving an AUC of 0.71 in predicting knee OA progression while offering ~9% faster inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u819d\u5173\u8282\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\uff08OA\uff09\u8fdb\u5c55\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u672a\u6765\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4bOA\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u6807\u5fd7\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728Osteoarthritis Initiative\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAUC\u63d0\u53472%\u81f30.71\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u7ea69%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, in practical applications, hardware limitations often degrade data quality, while real-time constraints restrict model inference to instantaneous state and scene observations. These limitations seriously reduce the efficacy of learning from expert demonstrations, resulting in failures in object localization, grasp planning, and long-horizon task execution. To address these challenges, we propose Causal Diffusion Policy (CDP), a novel transformer-based diffusion model that enhances action prediction by conditioning on historical action sequences, thereby enabling more coherent and context-aware visuomotor policy learning. To further mitigate the computational cost associated with autoregressive inference, a caching mechanism is also introduced to store attention key-value pairs from previous timesteps, substantially reducing redundant computations during execution. Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments, spanning diverse 2D and 3D manipulation tasks, demonstrate that CDP uniquely leverages historical action sequences to achieve significantly higher accuracy than existing methods. Moreover, even when faced with degraded input observation quality, CDP maintains remarkable precision by reasoning through temporal continuity, which highlights its practical robustness for robotic control under realistic, imperfect conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "CDP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCausal Diffusion Policy (CDP)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCDP\u5728\u591a\u79cd2D\u548c3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "CDP\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u56fe\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u6784\u5efa\u901a\u7528\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff08\u5982\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u591a\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u903c\u8fd1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572829\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Large general-purpose models are trained for many tasks, but work best on high-frequency use cases. After training, it is hard to adapt a model to perform well on specific use cases underrepresented in the training corpus. Relying on prompt engineering or few-shot examples to maximize the output quality on a particular test case can be frustrating, as models can be highly sensitive to small changes, react in unpredicted ways or rely on a fixed system prompt for maintaining performance. In this work, we ask: \"Can we optimize our training protocols to both improve controllability and performance on underrepresented use cases at inference time?\" We revisit the divide between training and inference techniques to improve long-tail performance while providing users with a set of control levers the model is trained to be responsive to. We create a detailed taxonomy of data characteristics and task provenance to explicitly control generation attributes and implicitly condition generations at inference time. We fine-tune a base model to infer these markers automatically, which makes them optional at inference time. This principled and flexible approach yields pronounced improvements in performance, especially on examples from the long tail of the training distribution. While we observe an average lift of 5.7% win rates in open-ended generation quality with our markers, we see over 9.1% gains in underrepresented domains. We also observe relative lifts of up to 14.1% on underrepresented tasks like CodeRepair and absolute improvements of 35.3% on length instruction following evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u7528\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6216\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u65ad\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53475.7%\uff0c\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u53479.1%\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u590d\uff09\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe14.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

As a result, they often produce implausible poses under joint occlusions or rapid motion changes. To address these challenges, we propose the PoseGRAF framework. We first construct a dual graph convolutional structure that separately processes joint and bone graphs, effectively capturing their local dependencies. A Cross-Attention module is then introduced to model interdependencies between bone directions and joint features. Building upon this, a dynamic fusion module is designed to adaptively integrate both feature types by leveraging the relational dependencies between joints and bones. An improved Transformer encoder is further incorporated in a residual manner to generate the final output.

Then, a multi-criteria based solution is proposed for finding the most suitable sampling and distribution for label and sensitive attribute, in terms of fairness and classification accuracy", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5747\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff09\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We argue existing safety assessments of contemporary foundation AI models underestimate this risk, largely due to flawed assumptions and inadequate evaluation methods. First, assessments mistakenly assume biological weapons development requires tacit knowledge, or skills gained through hands-on experience that cannot be easily verbalized. Second, they rely on imperfect benchmarks that overlook how AI can uplift both nonexperts and already-skilled individuals. To challenge the tacit knowledge assumption, we examine cases where individuals without formal expertise, including a 2011 Norwegian ultranationalist who synthesized explosives, successfully carried out complex technical tasks. We also review efforts to document pathogen construction processes, highlighting how such tasks can be conveyed in text. We identify \"elements of success\" for biological weapons development that large language models can describe in words, including steps such as acquiring materials and performing technical procedures. Applying this framework, we find that advanced AI models Llama 3.1 405B, ChatGPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet can accurately guide users through the recovery of live poliovirus from commercially obtained synthetic DNA, challenging recent claims that current models pose minimal biosecurity risk.

Consistency models can distill these models into efficient one-step generators; however, unlike flow- and diffusion-based methods, their performance inevitably degrades when increasing the number of steps, which we show both analytically and empirically. Flow maps generalize these approaches by connecting any two noise levels in a single step and remain effective across all step counts. In this paper, we introduce two new continuous-time objectives for training flow maps, along with additional novel training techniques, generalizing existing consistency and flow matching objectives. We further demonstrate that autoguidance can improve performance, using a low-quality model for guidance during distillation, and an additional boost can be achieved by adversarial finetuning, with minimal loss in sample diversity. We extensively validate our flow map models, called Align Your Flow, on challenging image generation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art few-step generation performance on both ImageNet 64x64 and 512x512, using small and efficient neural networks.

However, optimizing its settings remains a complex and error-prone process due to patient-specific variability. While Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows promise for MV control, current stateof-the-art (SOTA) methods struggle with the hybrid (continuous and discrete) nature of MV actions. Discretizing the action space limits available actions due to exponential growth in combinations and introduces distribution shifts that can compromise safety. In this paper, we propose optimizations that build upon prior work in action space reduction to address the challenges of discrete action spaces. We also adapt SOTA offline RL algorithms (IQL and EDAC) to operate directly on hybrid action spaces, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of discretization. Additionally, we introduce a clinically grounded reward function based on ventilator-free days and physiological targets, which provides a more meaningful optimization objective compared to traditional sparse mortality-based rewards.

In contrast to traditional approaches -- which typically assume full knowledge of the forward model or access to paired degraded and ground-truth images -- the proposed method operates under minimal assumptions and relies only on small, unpaired datasets. This makes it particularly well-suited for real-world scenarios, where the forward model is often unknown or misspecified, and collecting paired data is costly or infeasible. The method leverages conditional flow matching to model the distribution of degraded observations, while simultaneously learning the forward model via a distribution-matching loss that arises naturally from the framework. Empirically, it outperforms both single-image blind and unsupervised approaches on deblurring and non-uniform point spread function (PSF) calibration tasks. It also matches state-of-the-art performance on blind super-resolution.

Their widespread adoption is often credited to their dramatically improved trainability: residual networks train faster, more stably, and achieve higher accuracy than their feedforward counterparts. While numerous techniques, ranging from improved initialization to advanced learning rate schedules, have been proposed to close the performance gap between residual and feedforward networks, this gap has persisted. In this work, we propose an alternative explanation: residual networks do not merely reparameterize feedforward networks, but instead inhabit a different function space. We design a controlled post-training comparison to isolate generalization performance from trainability; we find that variable-depth architectures, similar to ResNets, consistently outperform fixed-depth networks, even when optimization is unlikely to make a difference. These results suggest that residual connections confer performance advantages beyond optimization, pointing instead to a deeper inductive bias aligned with the structure of natural data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u4e3a\u4f55\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5176\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6e90\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e0e\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u53ef\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u53ef\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982ResNet\uff09\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4f18\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u56e0\u5176\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u66f4\u5339\u914d\u3002"}}

Despite recent advances in enhancing language model (LM) reasoning, most methods lean toward exploitation, and increasingly encounter performance plateaus. In this work, we revisit entropy -- a signal of exploration in RL -- and examine its relationship to exploratory reasoning in LMs. Through empirical analysis, we uncover strong positive correlations between high-entropy regions and three types of exploratory reasoning actions: (1) pivotal tokens that determine or connect logical steps, (2) reflective actions such as self-verification and correction, and (3) rare behaviors under-explored by the base LMs. Motivated by this, we introduce a minimal modification to standard RL with only one line of code: augmenting the advantage function with an entropy-based term. Unlike traditional maximum-entropy methods which encourage exploration by promoting uncertainty, we encourage exploration by promoting longer and deeper reasoning chains.

Here, we extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities as additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of an instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction occurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or complete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction probabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution probabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as solution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search space as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches containing unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been evaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of instruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire code sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS. Our results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in the IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on solution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of magnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show that the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code.

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and similar schemes split text once, build a static vocabulary, and leave the model stuck with that choice. We relax this rigidity by introducing an autoregressive U-Net that learns to embed its own tokens as it trains. The network reads raw bytes, pools them into words, then pairs of words, then up to 4 words, giving it a multi-scale view of the sequence. At deeper stages, the model must predict further into the future -- anticipating the next few words rather than the next byte -- so deeper stages focus on broader semantic patterns while earlier stages handle fine details. When carefully tuning and controlling pretraining compute, shallow hierarchies tie strong BPE baselines, and deeper hierarchies have a promising trend.

Some prior work has considered the effectiveness of LLMs in answering expert-written health queries/prompts, questions from medical examination banks, or queries based on pre-existing clinical cases. Unfortunately, these existing studies completely ignore an in-the-wild evaluation of the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health concerns and queries typically asked by general users, which corresponds to the more prevalent use case for LLMs. To address this research gap, this paper presents the findings from a university-level competition that leveraged a novel, crowdsourced approach for evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in answering everyday health queries. Over the course of a week, a total of 34 participants prompted four publicly accessible LLMs with 212 real (or imagined) health concerns, and the LLM generated responses were evaluated by a team of nine board-certified physicians. At a high level, our findings indicate that on average, 76% of the 212 LLM responses were deemed to be accurate by physicians. Further, with the help of medical professionals, we investigated whether RAG versions of these LLMs (powered with a comprehensive medical knowledge base) can improve the quality of responses generated by LLMs. Finally, we also derive qualitative insights to explain our quantitative findings by conducting interviews with seven medical professionals who were shown all the prompts in our competition.

Centralized RL suffers from scalability issues, while decentralized approaches often lack unified objectives, resulting in limited network-level efficiency. In this paper, we propose HiLight, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework with global adversarial guidance for large-scale TSC. HiLight consists of a high-level Meta-Policy, which partitions the traffic network into subregions and generates sub-goals using a Transformer-LSTM architecture, and a low-level Sub-Policy, which controls individual intersections with global awareness. To improve the alignment between global planning and local execution, we introduce an adversarial training mechanism, where the Meta-Policy generates challenging yet informative sub-goals, and the Sub-Policy learns to surpass these targets, leading to more effective coordination. We evaluate HiLight across both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and additionally construct a large-scale Manhattan network with diverse traffic conditions, including peak transitions, adverse weather, and holiday surges.

Via curriculum learning, we then dynamically re-formulate an unbiased subsample dataset for NAS optimisation, upon which the current NAS solution architecture performs poorly. We show that our DDS-NAS framework speeds up gradient-based NAS strategies by up to 27x without loss in performance. By maximising the contribution of each image sample during training, we reduce the duration of a NAS training cycle and the number of iterations required for convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u52a0\u901f\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff08NAS\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684kd\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u504f\u5b50\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "DDS-NAS\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u57faNAS\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u9ad8\u8fbe27\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u65e0\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u6001\u786c\u6837\u672c\u6316\u6398\u548c\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347NAS\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6536\u655b\u6240\u9700\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u3002"}}

Mutations and recombinations that reduce the distance to an optimum are considered as beneficial. Geometric and combinatorial analysis is used to derive closed-form expressions for transition probabilities between spheres around an optimum giving a complete description of Markov evolution of distances from an optimum over multiple generations. This paves the way for optimization of parameters of mutation and recombination operators. Here we derive optimality conditions for mutation and recombination radii maximizing the probabilities of mutation and crossover into the optimum. The analysis highlights important differences between these evolutionary operators. While mutation can potentially reach any part of the search space, the probability of beneficial mutation decreases with distance to an optimum, and the optimal mutation radius or rate should also decrease resulting in a slow-down of evolution near the optimum. Crossover recombination, on the other hand, acts in a subspace of the search space defined by the current population of strings.

In this paper, we revisit the classical coarse-to-fine design of FocalClick and introduce significant extensions. Inspired by its multi-stage strategy, we propose a novel pipeline, FocalClick-XL, to address these challenges simultaneously. Following the emerging trend of large-scale pretraining, we decompose interactive segmentation into meta-tasks that capture different levels of information -- context, object, and detail -- assigning a dedicated subnet to each level.This decomposition allows each subnet to undergo scaled pretraining with independent data and supervision, maximizing its effectiveness. To enhance flexibility, we share context- and detail-level information across different interaction forms as common knowledge while introducing a prompting layer at the object level to encode specific interaction types. As a result, FocalClick-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance on click-based benchmarks and demonstrates remarkable adaptability to diverse interaction formats, including boxes, scribbles, and coarse masks.

Previous methods typically focus on entropy-based exploration or empowerment-driven skill learning. However, entropy-based exploration struggles in large-scale state spaces (e.g., images), and empowerment-based methods with Mutual Information (MI) estimations have limitations in state exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skill discovery objective that maximizes the deviation of the state density of one skill from the explored regions of other skills, encouraging inter-skill state diversity similar to the initial MI objective.

Although existing methods have made progress in cross-modal interaction, low-light conditions, and model lightweight, there are still challenges like the lack of a unified single-stage framework, difficulty in balancing performance and fusion strategy, and unreasonable modality weight allocation. To address these, based on the YOLOv11 framework, we present YOLOv11-RGBT, a new comprehensive multimodal object detection framework. We designed six multispectral fusion modes and successfully applied them to models from YOLOv3 to YOLOv12 and RT-DETR. After reevaluating the importance of the two modalities, we proposed a P3 mid-fusion strategy and multispectral controllable fine-tuning (MCF) strategy for multispectral models. These improvements optimize feature fusion, reduce redundancy and mismatches, and boost overall model performance. Experiments show our framework excels on three major open-source multispectral object detection datasets, like LLVIP and FLIR. Particularly, the multispectral controllable fine-tuning strategy significantly enhanced model adaptability and robustness. On the FLIR dataset, it consistently improved YOLOv11 models' mAP by 3.41%-5.65%, reaching a maximum of 47.61%, verifying the framework and strategies' effectiveness.

To mitigate such issues, we propose a novel ''model MoE-ization'' strategy that leads to a conflict- and oblivion-resistant multi-task adaptation method. Given a weight matrix of a pre-trained model, our method applies SVD to it and introduces a learnable router to adjust its singular values based on tasks and samples. Accordingly, the weight matrix becomes a Mixture of Orthogonal Rank-one Experts (MoORE), in which each expert corresponds to the outer product of a left singular vector and the corresponding right one. We can improve the model capacity by imposing a learnable orthogonal transform on the right singular vectors. Unlike low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its MoE-driven variants, MoORE guarantees the experts' orthogonality and maintains the column space of the original weight matrix. These two properties make the adapted model resistant to the conflicts among the new tasks and the oblivion of its original tasks, respectively. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that MoORE outperforms existing multi-task adaptation methods consistently, showing its superiority in terms of conflict- and oblivion-resistance.

These findings suggest valuable mechanisms for human-LLM collaboration in tackling complex program synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "IPARC Challenge\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "IPARC Challenge\u7684600\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u5728\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5f52\u7eb3\u7f16\u7a0b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ec6\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709IPARC\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u51bb\u7ed3\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u534f\u4f5c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The fusion of camera and LiDAR data addresses the limitations of individual sensors but relies on precise extrinsic calibration. Recently, numerous end-to-end calibration methods have been proposed; however, most predict extrinsic parameters in a single step and lack iterative optimization capabilities. To address the increasing demand for higher accuracy, we propose a versatile iterative framework based on surrogate diffusion. This framework can enhance the performance of any calibration method without requiring architectural modifications. Specifically, the initial extrinsic parameters undergo iterative refinement through a denoising process, in which the original calibration method serves as a surrogate denoiser to estimate the final extrinsics at each step. For comparative analysis, we selected four state-of-the-art calibration methods as surrogate denoisers and compared the results of our diffusion process with those of two other iterative approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that when integrated with our diffusion model, all calibration methods achieve higher accuracy, improved robustness, and greater stability compared to other iterative techniques and their single-step counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u673a\u4e0eLiDAR\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5916\u53c2\uff0c\u539f\u59cb\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u9010\u6b65\u4f30\u8ba1\u6700\u7ec8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5355\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5916\u53c2\u6807\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025", "summary": "Off-policy learning (OPL) in contextual bandits aims to learn a decision-making policy that maximizes the target rewards by using only historical interaction data collected under previously developed policies. Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially-observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along with statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods in various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHyPeR\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6b21\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u51b3\u7b56\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b21\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyPeR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6b21\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyPeR\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HyPeR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6b21\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6b21\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u65f6\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u4e5f\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}}

However, there still lacks a comprehensive metric for assessing the editing quality. Existing metrics either require high human evaluation costs, which hinder large-scale evaluation, or are adapted from other tasks and lose task-specific concerns, failing to comprehensively evaluate both instruction-based modification and preservation of irrelevant regions, resulting in biased evaluation. To tackle this, we introduce a new metric called Balancing Preservation and Modification (BPM), tailored for instruction-based image editing by explicitly disentangling the image into editing-relevant and irrelevant regions for specific consideration. We first identify and locate editing-relevant regions, followed by a two-tier process to assess editing quality: Region-Aware Judge evaluates whether the position and size of the edited region align with the instruction, and Semantic-Aware Judge further assesses the instruction content compliance within editing-relevant regions as well as content preservation within irrelevant regions, yielding comprehensive and interpretable quality assessment. Moreover, the editing-relevant region localization in BPM can be integrated into image editing approaches to improve editing quality, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Using interferometric SAR data from Sentinel-1, we apply a long temporal-arc coherent change detection (LT-CCD) approach to track weekly damage trends over the first year of the 2023- Israel-Hamas War. We detect 92.5% of damage labels in reference data from the United Nations with a negligible (1.2%) false positive rate. The temporal fidelity of our approach reveals rapidly increasing damage during the first three months of the war focused in northern Gaza, a notable pause in damage during a temporary ceasefire, and surges of new damage as conflict hot-spots shift from north to south.

Label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM), for instance, exploits two-photon excitation of natural autofluorescence (AF) from native, metabolic proteins, making it ideal for in vivo endomicroscopy. Deep learning (DL) models have been widely used in other optical imaging technologies to predict specific target annotations and thereby digitally augment the specificity of these label-free images. However, this computational specificity has only rarely been implemented for MPM. In this work, we used a data set of label-free MPM images from a series of different immune cell types (5,075 individual cells for binary classification in mixed samples and 3,424 cells for a multi-class classification task) and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cell types based on this label-free AF as input. A low-complexity squeezeNet architecture was able to achieve reliable immune cell classification results (0.89 ROC-AUC, 0.95 PR-AUC, for binary classification in mixed samples; 0.689 F1 score, 0.697 precision, 0.748 recall, and 0.683 MCC for six-class classification in isolated samples). Perturbation tests confirmed that the model is not confused by extracellular environment and that both input AF channels (NADH and FAD) are about equally important to the classification. In the future, such predictive DL models could directly detect specific immune cells in unstained images and thus, computationally improve the specificity of label-free MPM which would have great potential for in vivo endomicroscopy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff08MPM\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f53\u5185\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u67d3\u8272\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u5185\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u591a\u5149\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\uff08MPM\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u5bf9\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0MPM\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u514d\u75ab\u7ec6\u80de\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b5,075\u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u548c3,424\u4e2a\u7ec6\u80de\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684SqueezeNet\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08ROC-AUC\u4e3a0.89\uff0cPR-AUC\u4e3a0.95\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff08F1\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0.689\uff09\u3002\u6270\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0MPM\u7684\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f53\u5185\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expressions, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic results. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second.

This effect persists on structured data when the teacher has not generalized.To analyze it in isolation, we consider finite random i.i.d. datasets where generalization is a priori impossible and a successful teacher fit implies pure memorization. Still, students can learn non-trivial information about the held-out data, in some cases up to perfect accuracy.

To address these challenges, we present FrontendBench, a benchmark co-developed by humans and LLMs. FrontendBench categorizes tasks based on code functionality and incorporates interactive test scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of front-end code generation capabilities. The benchmark comprises 148 meticulously crafted prompt-test case pairs spanning five levels of web components, from basic UI elements to complex interactive features. Each task reflects realistic front-end development challenges. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that executes generated code within a sandbox environment and assesses outcomes using predefined test scripts. This framework achieves a 90.54% agreement rate with expert human evaluations, demonstrating high reliability. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs on FrontendBench and observe substantial performance disparities in handling real-world front-end tasks.

Unfortunately, the high fidelity also comes at a high computational cost due the inherently sequential generative process. In this work, we seek to optimally balance quality and computational cost, and propose a framework to allow the amount of computation to vary for each prompt, depending on its complexity. Each prompt is automatically routed to the most appropriate text-to-image generation function, which may correspond to a distinct number of denoising steps of a diffusion model, or a disparate, independent text-to-image model. Unlike uniform cost reduction techniques (e.g., distillation, model quantization), our approach achieves the optimal trade-off by learning to reserve expensive choices (e.g., 100+ denoising steps) only for a few complex prompts, and employ more economical choices (e.g., small distilled model) for less sophisticated prompts.

Despite increasing awareness, researchers and practitioners face critical challenges in developing accurate and generalizable predictive models for mental health disorders. Traditional classification approaches often struggle with the complexity of depression, as it is influenced by multifaceted, interdependent factors, including occupational stress, sleep patterns, and job satisfaction. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a stacking-based ensemble learning approach to improve the predictive accuracy of depression classification among professionals. The Depression Professional Dataset has been collected from Kaggle. The dataset comprises demographic, occupational, and lifestyle attributes that influence mental well-being. Our stacking model integrates multiple base learners with a logistic regression-mediated model, effectively capturing diverse learning patterns.

In this work, we present the scaling-up of our recently proposed EO Foundation Model, PhilEO Geo-Aware U-Net, on the unlabeled 23TB dataset MajorTOM, which covers the vast majority of the Earth's surface, as well as on the specialized subset FastTOM 2TB that does not include oceans and ice. We develop and study various PhilEO model variants with different numbers of parameters and architectures. Finally, we fine-tune the models on the PhilEO Bench for road density estimation, building density pixel-wise regression, and land cover semantic segmentation, and we evaluate the performance. Our results demonstrate that for all n-shots for road density regression, the PhilEO 44M MajorTOM 23TB model outperforms PhilEO Globe 0.5TB 44M. We also show that for most n-shots for road density estimation and building density regression, PhilEO 200M FastTOM outperforms all the other models. The effectiveness of both dataset and model scaling is validated using the PhilEO Bench.

This paper establishes a fundamental and previously unrecognized connection: ZOO with finite differences is equivalent to a specific instance of single-step Policy Optimization (PO). We formally unveil that the implicitly smoothed objective function optimized by common ZOO algorithms is identical to a single-step PO objective. Furthermore, we show that widely used ZOO gradient estimators, are mathematically equivalent to the REINFORCE gradient estimator with a specific baseline function, revealing the variance-reducing mechanism in ZOO from a PO perspective.Built on this unified framework, we propose ZoAR (Zeroth-Order Optimization with Averaged Baseline and Query Reuse), a novel ZOO algorithm incorporating PO-inspired variance reduction techniques: an averaged baseline from recent evaluations and query reuse analogous to experience replay. Our theoretical analysis further substantiates these techniques reduce variance and enhance convergence. Extensive empirical studies validate our theory and demonstrate that ZoAR significantly outperforms other methods in terms of convergence speed and final performance.

While traditional time series forecasting relies on historical patterns and temporal dependencies, incorporating external factors -- such as weather indicators -- has shown significant potential for improving prediction accuracy in complex real-world applications. However, the inclusion of these additional features often degrades the performance of global predictive models trained on entire populations, despite improving individual household-level models. To address this challenge, we found that a hypernetwork architecture can effectively leverage external factors to enhance the accuracy of global electrical consumption forecasting models, by specifically adjusting the model weights to each consumer.\n  We collected a comprehensive dataset spanning two years, comprising consumption data from over 6000 luxembourgish households and corresponding external factors such as weather indicators, holidays, and major local events. By comparing various forecasting models, we demonstrate that a hypernetwork approach outperforms existing methods when associated to external factors, reducing forecasting errors and achieving the best accuracy while maintaining the benefits of a global model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u6307\u6807\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u7403\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u8282\u5047\u65e5\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u56e0\u7d20\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u7403\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8d39\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

In image classification, this involves removing the influence of particular training samples, semantic classes, or visual styles without full retraining. We introduce \\textbf{Forget-Aligned Model Reconstruction (FAMR)}, a theoretically grounded and computationally efficient framework for post-hoc unlearning in deep image classifiers.

A theoretical analysis links FAMR's solution to influence-function-based retraining approximations, with bounds on parameter and output deviation. Empirical results on class forgetting tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 demonstrate FAMR's effectiveness, with strong performance retention and minimal computational overhead.

Our approach combined pre- and post-surveys with a controlled experimental task where participants solved programming problems with an AI assistant that provided both accurate and deliberately incorrect suggestions, allowing direct observation of students' reliance patterns when faced with varying AI reliability.

These models typically rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which process video frames individually to extract visual embeddings. However, generating embeddings for large-scale videos requires ViT inferencing across numerous frames, posing a major hurdle to real-world deployment and necessitating solutions for integration into scalable video data management systems. This paper introduces D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, a video-language query engine that accelerates ViT-based VideoLMs by reusing computations across consecutive frames. At its core is ReuseViT, a modified ViT model specifically designed for VideoLM tasks, which learns to detect inter-frame reuse opportunities, striking an effective balance between accuracy and reuse. Although ReuseViT significantly reduces computation, these savings do not directly translate into performance gains on GPUs. To overcome this, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu integrates memory-compute joint compaction techniques that convert the FLOP savings into tangible performance gains. Evaluations on three VideoLM tasks show that D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu accelerates embedding generation by up to a 2.64x within a 2% error bound, dramatically enhancing the practicality of VideoLMs for large-scale video analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901fViT-based VideoLMs\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfViT-based VideoLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u9010\u5e27\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReuseViT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e27\u95f4\u91cd\u7528\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5b58-\u8ba1\u7b97\u8054\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u8282\u7701\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aVideoLM\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cD\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f32.64\u500d\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u57282%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VideoLMs\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a principled yet practical evaluation framework for selecting calibrated thresholded classifiers that explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in class prevalences and domain-specific cost asymmetries often found in clinical settings. Building on the theory of proper scoring rules, particularly the Schervish representation, we derive an adjusted variant of cross-entropy (log score) that averages cost-weighted performance over clinically relevant ranges of class balance.

However, it is challenging to leverage such token-level reward as guidance for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), since DPO is formulated as a sequence-level bandit problem. To address this challenge, this work decomposes the sequence-level PPO into a sequence of token-level proximal policy optimization problems and then frames the problem of token-level PPO with token-level reward guidance, from which closed-form optimal token-level policy and the corresponding token-level reward can be derived. Using the obtained reward and Bradley-Terry model, this work establishes a framework of computable loss functions with token-level reward guidance for DPO, and proposes a practical reward guidance based on the induced DPO reward. This formulation enables different tokens to exhibit varying degrees of deviation from reference policy based on their respective rewards. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance improvements over DPO, with win rate gains of up to 7.5 points on MT-Bench, 6.2 points on AlpacaEval 2, and 4.3 points on Arena-Hard.

Bleeding detection and localization during surgery is especially challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets that reflect real surgical scenarios. We propose orGAN, a GAN-based system for generating high-fidelity, annotated surgical images of bleeding. By leveraging small \"mimicking organ\" datasets, synthetic models that replicate tissue properties and bleeding, our approach reduces ethical concerns and data-collection costs. orGAN builds on StyleGAN with Relational Positional Learning to simulate bleeding events realistically and mark bleeding coordinates.

While the literature attributes shortcuts to biases in superficial features, we show that imbalances in the semantic distribution of sample embeddings induce spurious semantic correlations, compromising model robustness. To address this issue, we propose SCISSOR (Semantic Cluster Intervention for Suppressing ShORtcut), a Siamese network-based debiasing approach that remaps the semantic space by discouraging latent clusters exploited as shortcuts. Unlike prior data-debiasing approaches, SCISSOR eliminates the need for data augmentation and rewriting. We evaluate SCISSOR on 6 models across 4 benchmarks: Chest-XRay and Not-MNIST in computer vision, and GYAFC and Yelp in NLP tasks. Compared to several baselines, SCISSOR reports +5.3 absolute points in F1 score on GYAFC, +7.3 on Yelp, +7.7 on Chest-XRay, and +1 on Not-MNIST. SCISSOR is also highly advantageous for lightweight models with ~9.5% improvement on F1 for ViT on computer vision datasets and ~11.9% for BERT on NLP.

Despite its rapid growth and algorithmic relevance, the field of computational studies in influencer marketing remains fragmented, especially with limited systematic reviews covering the computational methodologies employed. This makes overarching scientific measurements in the influencer economy very scarce, to the detriment of interested stakeholders outside of platforms themselves, such as regulators, but also researchers from other fields. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of computational studies in influencer marketing by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) based on the PRISMA model. The paper analyses 69 studies to identify key research themes, methodologies, and future directions in this research field. The review identifies four major research themes: Influencer identification and characterisation, Advertising strategies and engagement, Sponsored content analysis and discovery, and Fairness. Methodologically, the studies are categorised into machine learning-based techniques (e.g., classification, clustering) and non-machine-learning-based techniques (e.g., statistical analysis, network analysis). Key findings reveal a strong focus on optimising commercial outcomes, with limited attention to regulatory compliance and ethical considerations. The review highlights the need for more nuanced computational research that incorporates contextual factors such as language, platform, and industry type, as well as improved model explainability and dataset reproducibility. The paper concludes by proposing a multidisciplinary research agenda that emphasises the need for further links to regulation and compliance technology, finer granularity in analysis, and the development of standardised datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08SLR\uff09\u5206\u6790\u4e8669\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u7f51\u7ea2\u8425\u9500\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u56db\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f51\u7ea2\u8425\u9500\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u8425\u9500\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8ePRISMA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u5206\u679069\u9879\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002", "result": "\u56db\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u7ea2\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5e7f\u544a\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u8d5e\u52a9\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u5206\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5546\u4e1a\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u5408\u89c4\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u76d1\u7ba1\u5408\u89c4\u6280\u672f\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often rely on either high-poly mesh modeling with post-hoc simplification or massive 3D Gaussians, resulting in a complex pipeline or limited visual realism. In this paper, we demonstrate that such exhaustive modeling is unnecessary for achieving compelling immersive experience. We introduce ImmerseGen, a novel agent-guided framework for compact and photorealistic world modeling. ImmerseGen represents scenes as hierarchical compositions of lightweight geometric proxies, i.e., simplified terrain and billboard meshes, and generates photorealistic appearance by synthesizing RGBA textures onto these proxies. Specifically, we propose terrain-conditioned texturing for user-centric base world synthesis, and RGBA asset texturing for midground and foreground scenery.This reformulation offers several advantages: (i) it simplifies modeling by enabling agents to guide generative models in producing coherent textures that integrate seamlessly with the scene; (ii) it bypasses complex geometry creation and decimation by directly synthesizing photorealistic textures on proxies, preserving visual quality without degradation; (iii) it enables compact representations suitable for real-time rendering on mobile VR headsets. To automate scene creation from text prompts, we introduce VLM-based modeling agents enhanced with semantic grid-based analysis for improved spatial reasoning and accurate asset placement. ImmerseGen further enriches scenes with dynamic effects and ambient audio to support multisensory immersion. Experiments on scene generation and live VR showcases demonstrate that ImmerseGen achieves superior photorealism, spatial coherence and rendering efficiency compared to prior methods.

We introduce a spatio-temporal inversion framework that embeds a deep-learning surrogate of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) within a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to perform Bayesian inference of both emission rate and source location in dynamic flow fields. By substituting costly numerical solvers with a multilayer perceptron trained on high-fidelity CFD outputs, our surrogate captures spatial heterogeneity and temporal evolution of gas dispersion, while delivering near-real-time predictions.

In this work, we present a new curated MRI dataset designed specifically for brain tumor segmentation and classification tasks. The dataset comprises 6,000 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans annotated by certified radiologists and physicians, spanning three major tumor types-glioma, meningioma, and pituitary-as well as non-tumorous cases. Each sample includes high-resolution labels and is categorized across axial, sagittal, and coronal imaging planes to facilitate robust model development and cross-view generalization. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we propose a transformer-based segmentation model and benchmark it against established baselines. Our method achieves the highest weighted mean Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of 82.3%, with improvements observed across all tumor categories. Importantly, this study serves primarily as an introduction to the dataset, establishing foundational benchmarks for future research.

Accepted to ICML 2025", "summary": "Distribution matching (DM) is a versatile domain-invariant representation learning technique that has been applied to tasks such as fair classification, domain adaptation, and domain translation. Non-parametric DM methods struggle with scalability and adversarial DM approaches suffer from instability and mode collapse. While likelihood-based methods are a promising alternative, they often impose unnecessary biases through fixed priors or require explicit density models (e.g., flows) that can be challenging to train. We address this limitation by introducing a novel approach to training likelihood-based DM using expressive score-based prior distributions. Our key insight is that gradient-based DM training only requires the prior's score function -- not its density -- allowing us to train the prior via denoising score matching. This approach eliminates biases from fixed priors (e.g., in VAEs), enabling more effective use of geometry-preserving regularization, while avoiding the challenge of learning an explicit prior density model (e.g., a flow-based prior). Our method also demonstrates better stability and computational efficiency compared to other diffusion-based priors (e.g., LSGM). Furthermore, experiments demonstrate superior performance across multiple tasks, establishing our score-based method as a stable and effective approach to distribution matching.

However, many of these tasks are also characterized by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical formulation is unknown and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where feasible regions are small, irregular, and difficult to identify. In such cases, a substantial portion of the optimization budget may be spent just trying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting the effectiveness of existing methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines a trust region from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information from both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy allows the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations, enabling the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently accelerate the discovery of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite and other physics-inspired benchmarks, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines for constrained black-box optimization across varying levels of constraint severity and problem dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08FuRBO\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6602\u8d35\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u521d\u59cb\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u65f6\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "method": "FuRBO\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u805a\u7126\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728BBOB-constrained COCO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFuRBO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e2\u81f360\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "FuRBO\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6602\u8d35\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We seek a general theory of bandit learnability, akin to the PAC framework for classification. Our investigation is guided by the following two questions: (1) which classes F are learnable, and (2) how they are learnable. For example, in the case of binary PAC classification, learnability is fully determined by a combinatorial dimension - the VC dimension- and can be attained via a simple algorithmic principle, namely, empirical risk minimization (ERM). In contrast to classical learning-theoretic results, our findings reveal limitations of learning in structured bandits, offering insights into the boundaries of bandit learnability. First, for the question of \"which\", we show that the paradigm of identifying the learnable classes via a dimension-like quantity fails for bandit learning. We give a simple proof demonstrating that no combinatorial dimension can characterize bandit learnability, even in finite classes, following a standard definition of dimension introduced by Ben-David et al. (2019). For the question of \"how\", we prove a computational hardness result: we construct a reward function class for which at most two queries are needed to find the optimal action, yet no algorithm can do so in polynomial time unless RP=NP. We also prove that this class admits efficient algorithms for standard algorithmic operations often considered in learning theory, such as an ERM. This implies that computational hardness is in this case inherent to the task of bandit learning.

However, domain shifts, such as variations in MRI machine types or acquisition parameters, pose significant challenges to model calibration and uncertainty estimation. This study investigates the impact of domain shift on WMH segmentation by proposing maximum-entropy regularization techniques to enhance model calibration and uncertainty estimation, with the purpose of identifying errors post-deployment using predictive uncertainty as a proxy measure that does not require ground-truth labels. To do this, we conducted experiments using a U-Net architecture to evaluate these regularization schemes on two publicly available datasets, assessing performance with the Dice coefficient, expected calibration error, and entropy-based uncertainty estimates. Our results show that entropy-based uncertainty estimates can anticipate segmentation errors, and that maximum-entropy regularization further strengthens the correlation between uncertainty and segmentation performance while also improving model calibration under domain shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u767d\u8d28\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08WMH\uff09\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5272\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u5982MRI\u673a\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u6216\u91c7\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff09\u5bf9WMH\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528U-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ecDice\u7cfb\u6570\u3001\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5272\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WMH\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, security and resilience are especially highlighted in the 6G design principles. However, safeguarding 6G networks will be quite challenging due to various known and unknown threats from highly heterogeneous networks and diversified security requirements of distinct use cases, calling for a comprehensive re-design of security architecture. This motivates us to propose ES3A (Entire Smart Service-based Security Architecture), a novel security architecture for 6G networks. Specifically, we first discuss six high-level principles of our ES3A that include hierarchy, flexibility, scalability, resilience, endogeny, and trust and privacy. With these goals in mind, we then introduce three guidelines from a deployment perspective, envisioning our ES3A that offers service-based security, end-to-end protection, and smart security automation for 6G networks. Our architecture consists of three layers and three domains. It relies on a two-stage orchestration mechanism to tailor smart security strategies for customized protection in high-dynamic 6G networks, thereby addressing the aforementioned challenges. Finally, we prototype the proposed ES3A on a real-world radio system based on Software-Defined Radio (SDR). Experiments show the effectiveness of our ES3A.

The radiomics-enhanced attention-augmented U-Net model showed a greater model stability evidenced by reduced performance variability (SDD = 0.18 $\\pm$ 0.09 vs. 0.21 $\\pm$ 0.06; p=0.03) and smoother validation curves with radiomics integration.\n  Conclusion: These results validate our hypothesis that fusing radiomics with raw imaging data boosts segmentation performance and stability in state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u53d1\u6027\u786c\u5316\uff08MS\uff09\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MS\u75c5\u7076\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6d53\u5ea6\u7387\u548cR\u00e9nyi\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ResNeXt-UNet\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u7684ResNeXt-UNet\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08Dice\u5f97\u52060.774\u00b10.05\uff09\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite that, accurately estimating domains of attraction for nonlinear systems remains a challenging task, where existing methods are conservative or limited to low-dimensional systems. The estimation becomes even more challenging when accounting for state constraints. In this work, we propose a framework to accurately estimate safe (state-constrained) domains of attraction for discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems. In establishing this framework, we first derive a new Zubov equation, whose solution corresponds to the exact safe domain of attraction. The solution to the aforementioned Zubov equation is shown to be unique and continuous over the whole state space. We then present a physics-informed approach to approximating the solution of the Zubov equation using neural networks. To obtain certifiable estimates of the domain of attraction from the neural network approximate solutions, we propose a verification framework that can be implemented using standard verification tools (e.g., $\u03b1,\\!\u03b2$-CROWN and dReal).

The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.\n  Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain.

The temporal coherence inherent in these tasks presents an opportunity to reuse intermediate results from previous frames and avoid redundant computations. Recent work has shown that caching intermediate features to be reused in subsequent inferences is an effective method to reduce latency in diffusion models. We extend this idea to real-time rendering and present ReFrame, which explores different caching policies to optimize trade-offs between quality and performance in rendering workloads. ReFrame can be applied to a variety of encoder-decoder style networks commonly found in rendering pipelines. Experimental results show that we achieve 1.4x speedup on average with negligible quality loss in three real-time rendering tasks.

Producing high-quality reconstructions typically requires many X-ray measurements; this process can be slow and expensive, especially for dense materials. Recent work incorporating artifact reduction priors within a plug-and-play (PnP) reconstruction framework has shown promising results in improving image quality from sparse-view XCT scans while enhancing the generalizability of deep learning-based solutions. However, this method uses a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) for artifact reduction, which captures only slice-independent information from the 3D reconstruction, limiting performance. In this paper, we propose a PnP reconstruction method that uses a 2.5D artifact reduction CNN as the prior. This approach leverages inter-slice information from adjacent slices, capturing richer spatial context while remaining computationally efficient. We show that this 2.5D prior not only improves the quality of reconstructions but also enables the model to directly suppress commonly occurring XCT artifacts (such as beam hardening), eliminating the need for artifact correction pre-processing. Experiments on both experimental and synthetic cone-beam XCT data demonstrate that the proposed method better preserves fine structural details, such as pore size and shape, leading to more accurate defect detection compared to 2D priors. In particular, we demonstrate strong performance on experimental XCT data using a 2.5D artifact reduction prior trained entirely on simulated scans, highlighting the proposed method's ability to generalize across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2.5D CNN\u7684PnP\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feXCT\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u90bb\u5207\u7247\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf2D CNN\u5728XCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4ec5\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5207\u7247\u72ec\u7acb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c2.5D CNN\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u591a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75282.5D CNN\u4f5c\u4e3aPnP\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76f8\u90bb\u5207\u7247\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u6291\u5236\u5e38\u89c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c2.5D\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\uff08\u5982\u5b54\u9699\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "2.5D CNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feXCT\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf2D\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f2a\u5f71\u6821\u6b63\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3002"}}

This link function called also mirror function defines the mapping between the primal and dual spaces and is associated with a very-wide (in fact, theoretically infinite) class of generalized trace-form entropies. In order to derive novel MD updates, we estimate generalized exponential function, which closely approximates the inverse of the multi-parametric Tempesta generalized logarithm. The shape and properties of the Tempesta logarithm and its inverse-deformed exponential functions can be tuned by several hyperparameters. By learning these hyperparameters, we can adapt to distribution or geometry of training data, and we can adjust them to achieve desired properties of MD algorithms.

Distinguishing these coordinated efforts from genuine public discourse remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of such attacks. Our work focuses on detecting coordinated campaigns by modeling the problem as a graph classification task. We leverage the recently introduced Large Engagement Networks (LEN) dataset, which contains over 300 networks capturing engagement patterns from both fake and authentic trends on Twitter prior to the 2023 Turkish elections. The graphs in LEN were constructed by collecting interactions related to campaigns that stemmed from ephemeral astroturfing. Established graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle to accurately classify campaign graphs, highlighting the challenges posed by LEN due to the large size of its networks. To address this, we introduce a new graph classification method that leverages the density of local network structures. We propose a random weighted walk (RWW) approach in which node transitions are biased by local density measures such as degree, core number, or truss number. These RWWs are encoded using the Skip-gram model, producing density-aware structural embeddings for the nodes. Training message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) on these density-aware embeddings yields superior results compared to the simpler node features available in the dataset, with nearly a 12\\% and 5\\% improvement in accuracy for binary and multiclass classification, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating density-aware structural encoding with MPNNs provides a robust framework for identifying coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media networks such as Twitter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bc6\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u6e38\u8d70\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u968f\u673a\u52a0\u6743\u6e38\u8d70\uff08RWW\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u5ea6\u6570\u3001\u6838\u5fc3\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MPNN\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612%\u548c5%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u548cMPNN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, many real-world problems exhibit temporal dependence and strong correlations between the marginal distributions of the data-generating process, suggesting that the i.i.d. assumption is often unrealistic. In such cases, models naturally include time-series processes with mixing properties, as well as irreducible and aperiodic ergodic Markov chains. Moreover, the learning rates typically obtained in these settings are independent of the data distribution, which can lead to restrictive choices of hypothesis classes and suboptimal sample complexities for the learning algorithm. In this article, we consider the case where the training dataset is generated by an iterated random function (i.e., an iteratively defined time-homogeneous Markov chain) that is not necessarily irreducible or aperiodic. Under the assumption that the governing function is contractive with respect to its first argument and subject to certain regularity conditions on the hypothesis class, we first establish a uniform convergence result for the corresponding sample error. We then demonstrate the learnability of the approximate empirical risk minimization algorithm and derive its learning rate bound.

The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence applications to natural hazard modeling suggest a new avenue for addressing this problem. We utilize a deep learning storm surge model to efficiently estimate coastal surge risk in the United States from 900,000 synthetic TC events, accounting for projected changes in TC behavior and sea levels.

Accurately estimating the cardinality of a join operation -- analogous to its computational cost -- allows the optimization of query execution costs in relational database systems. However, although sketches have shown high efficacy in query optimization, they are typically constructed specifically for predefined selections in queries that are assumed to be given a priori, hindering their applicability to new queries. As a more general solution, we propose for Sum-Product Networks to dynamically approximate sketches on-the-fly. Sum-Product Networks can decompose and model multivariate distributions, such as relations, as linear combinations of multiple univariate distributions. By representing these univariate distributions as sketches, Sum-Product Networks can combine them element-wise to efficiently approximate the sketch of any query selection.

However, the existing causal inference literature primarily addresses treatment effects on frequently occurring events. But what if we are interested in estimating the effects of a policy intervention whose benefits, while potentially important, can only be observed and measured in rare yet impactful events, such as extreme climate events? The standard causal inference methodology is not designed for this type of inference since the events of interest may be scarce in the observed data and some degree of extrapolation is necessary. Extreme Value Theory (EVT) provides methodologies for analyzing statistical phenomena in such extreme regimes. We introduce a novel framework for assessing treatment effects in extreme data to capture the causal effect at the occurrence of rare events of interest. In particular, we employ the theory of multivariate regular variation to model extremities. We develop a consistent estimator for extreme treatment effects and present a rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of its performance.

Given that the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle being fundamental in the PAC theory and ubiquitous in practical machine learning, the recent work of arXiv:2412.02810 studied the universal rates of ERM for binary classification under the realizable setting. However, the assumption of realizability is too restrictive to hold in practice. Indeed, the majority of the literature on universal learning has focused on the realizable case, leaving the non-realizable case barely explored.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM for binary classification under the agnostic setting, where the ''learning curve\" reflects the decay of the excess risk as the sample size increases. We explore the possibilities of agnostic universal rates and reveal a compact trichotomy: there are three possible agnostic universal rates of ERM, being either $e^{-n}$, $o(n^{-1/2})$, or arbitrarily slow. We provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories.

In the age of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity, with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of astrophysical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff08Latent Augmented Neural ODEs\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5929\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u89c2\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\uff08\u5982JWST\u548cALMA\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u6790\u5929\u4f53\u7684\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u8026\u5408\u4e09\u7ef4\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Latent Augmented Neural ODEs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5316\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6765\u81ea3D-PDR\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u539f\u59cb\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u67f1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\uff08\u5728GPU\u4e0a\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, incorporating non-tabular data necessitates sophisticated feature extractors, often in combination with ideas of transfer learning. In this work, we investigate how latent features from pre-trained neural networks can be leveraged to adjust for sources of confounding. We formalize conditions under which these latent features enable valid adjustment and statistical inference in ATE estimation, demonstrating results along the example of double machine learning. We discuss critical challenges inherent to latent feature learning and downstream parameter estimation arising from the high dimensionality and non-identifiability of representations. Common structural assumptions for obtaining fast convergence rates with additive or sparse linear models are shown to be unrealistic for latent features. We argue, however, that neural networks are largely insensitive to these issues. In particular, we show that neural networks can achieve fast convergence rates by adapting to intrinsic notions of sparsity and dimension of the learning problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u5e73\u5747\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff08ATE\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u975e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u975e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cdATE\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u975e\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3aATE\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we expose a novel threat: adversarial inputs can be crafted to exploit excessive reasoning behaviors and substantially increase computational overhead without compromising model utility. Therefore, we propose a novel loss framework consisting of three components: (1) Priority Cross-Entropy Loss, a modification of the standard cross-entropy objective that emphasizes key tokens by leveraging the autoregressive nature of LMs; (2) Excessive Reasoning Loss, which encourages the model to initiate additional reasoning paths during inference; and (3) Delayed Termination Loss, which is designed to extend the reasoning process and defer the generation of final outputs. We optimize and evaluate our attack for the GSM8K and ORCA datasets on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen.

In contrast, learning methods using forward propagation of gradients operate in an online manner with a memory consumption independent of the number of time steps.

To resolve this trade-off, a Retrieval-Enhanced Aligned Diffusion termed READ is introduced, which is the first to merge molecular Retrieval-Augmented Generation with an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model. Specifically, a contrastively pre-trained encoder aligns atom-level representations during training, then retrieves graph embeddings of pocket-matched scaffolds to guide each reverse-diffusion step at inference. This single mechanism can inject real-world chemical priors exactly where needed, producing valid, diverse, and shape-complementary ligands.

Recent work has highlighted an inherent asymmetry in the initialization of LoRA's low-rank factors, which has been present since its inception and was presumably derived experimentally. This paper focuses on providing a comprehensive theoretical characterization of asymmetric LoRA with frozen random factors. First, while existing research provides upper-bound generalization guarantees based on averages over multiple experiments, the behaviour of a single fine-tuning run with specific random factors remains an open question. We address this by investigating the concentration of the typical LoRA generalization gap around its mean. Our main upper bound reveals a sample complexity of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{r}}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)$ with high probability for rank $r$ LoRAs trained on $N$ samples. Additionally, we also determine the fundamental limits in terms of sample efficiency, establishing a matching lower bound of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\right)$. By more closely reflecting the practical scenario of a single fine-tuning run, our findings offer crucial insights into the reliability and practicality of asymmetric LoRA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, in modern DE implementations, a major challenge lies in the limited population diversity caused by the fixed population size enforced by the generational replacement. Population size is a critical control parameter that significantly affects DE performance. Larger populations inherently contain a more diverse set of individuals, thereby facilitating broader exploration of the search space. Conversely, when the maximum evaluation budgets is constrained, smaller populations focusing on a limited number of promising candidates may be more suitable. Many state-of-the-art DE variants incorporate an archive mechanism, in which a subset of discarded individuals is preserved in an archive during generation replacement and reused in mutation operations. However, maintaining what is essentially a secondary population via an archive introduces additional design considerations, such as policies for insertion, deletion, and appropriate sizing. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DE framework called Unbounded Differential Evolution (UDE), which adds all generated candidates to the population without discarding any individual based on fitness. Unlike conventional DE, which removes inferior individuals during generational replacement, UDE eliminates replacement altogether, along with the associated complexities of archive management and dynamic population sizing.

Supplementary information: 19 pages, 12 figures and tables", "summary": "Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Skala\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u76f8\u5173\uff08XC\uff09\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u539f\u5b50\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u534a\u5c40\u57dfDFT\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1DFT\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u6700\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709XC\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8981\u6c42\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e1 kcal/mol\uff09\u3002", "method": "Skala\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60XC\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "Skala\u5728\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u539f\u5b50\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0e\u534a\u5c40\u57dfDFT\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Skala\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63d0\u5347DFT\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u671b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from the different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes), capturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different modules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration. This work contributes both a set of proven prompts and taxonomy for Qiskit code migration from earlier versions to version 0.46 and a methodology to asses the capabilities of LLMs to assist in the migration of quantum code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u91cd\u6784Qiskit\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408LLM\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u91cf\u5b50\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9762\u4e34API\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u4eceQiskit\u6587\u6863\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc1\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u91cd\u6784\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "result": "LLM\u5728\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316Qiskit\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u4ee3\u7801\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u5728\u6b64\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While these methods yield rich insights, they are time-consuming and require intensive expert intervention. Recent technological advances, including vision-language models (VLMs), have begun to automate parts of this process; however, existing efforts are often ad hoc and lack adaptability across research designs and geographic contexts. In this demo paper, we present StreetLens, a human-centered, researcher-configurable workflow that embeds relevant social science expertise in a VLM for scalable neighborhood environmental assessments. StreetLens mimics the process of trained human coders by grounding the analysis in questions derived from established interview protocols, retrieving relevant street view imagery (SVI), and generating a wide spectrum of semantic annotations from objective features (e.g., the number of cars) to subjective perceptions (e.g., the sense of disorder in an image). By enabling researchers to define the VLM's role through domain-informed prompting, StreetLens places domain knowledge at the core of the analysis process.

The framework overcomes key limitations in prior sign language technologies by enabling direct user inspection and modification of sign segments, thus enhancing naturalness, expressiveness, and user agency. Leveraging a streaming Conformer encoder and autoregressive Transformer-MDN decoder, the system synchronizes spoken input into upper-body and facial motion for 3D avatar rendering. Edits and user ratings feed into a human-in-the-loop optimization loop for continuous improvement. Experiments with 20 deaf signers and 5 interpreters show that the editable interface and participatory feedback significantly improve comprehension, naturalness, usability, and trust, while lowering cognitive load. With sub-20 ms per-frame inference on standard hardware, the system is ready for real-time communication and education. This work illustrates how technical and participatory innovation together enable accessible, explainable, and user-adaptive AI for sign language technology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u624b\u8bed\u52a8\u753b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684JSON\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u589e\u5f3a\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u8bed\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u4fee\u6539\u624b\u8bed\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u5f0fConformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer-MDN\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u97f3\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6b65\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a3D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u7684\u4e0a\u534a\u8eab\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684JSON\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u7528\u6237\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u754c\u9762\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bcf\u5e27\u4f4e\u4e8e20\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u521b\u65b0\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u63a8\u52a8\u624b\u8bed\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

However, software engineering is more than coding and is concerned with activities including maintenance and evolution of a project. In this context, the concept of LLM agents has gained traction, which utilize LLMs as reasoning engines to invoke external tools autonomously. But is an LLM agent the same as an AI software engineer? In this paper, we seek to understand this question by developing a Unified Software Engineering agent or USEagent. Unlike existing work which builds specialized agents for specific software tasks such as testing, debugging, and repair, our goal is to build a unified agent which can orchestrate and handle multiple capabilities. This gives the agent the promise of handling complex scenarios in software development such as fixing an incomplete patch, adding new features, or taking over code written by others. We envision USEagent as the first draft of a future AI Software Engineer which can be a team member in future software development teams involving both AI and humans. To evaluate the efficacy of USEagent, we build a Unified Software Engineering bench (USEbench) comprising of myriad tasks such as coding, testing, and patching. USEbench is a judicious mixture of tasks from existing benchmarks such as SWE-bench, SWT-bench, and REPOCOD. In an evaluation on USEbench consisting of 1,271 repository-level software engineering tasks, USEagent shows improved efficacy compared to existing general agents such as OpenHands CodeActAgent. There exist gaps in the capabilities of USEagent for certain coding tasks, which provides hints on further developing the AI Software Engineer of the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6210\u4e3aAI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee3\u7406USEagent\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u80dc\u4efb\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u9879\u76ee\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86USEagent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u8c03\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86USEbench\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "USEagent\u57281,271\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "USEagent\u662f\u672a\u6765AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u96cf\u5f62\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

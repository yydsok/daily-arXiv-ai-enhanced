In\ncooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects\nthat are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which\nonly requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact\npoints is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this\nselection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially\nwith the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by\nhow humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose\ncombining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search\nto select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for\ncontact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a\nvariety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate\nthat ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the\nanalytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection."}

Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal\nguarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified\nrobustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for\nfew-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical\ngaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is\ntailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification\n(\\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an\nadaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a\ntwofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for\nclassification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning\nscenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two\nvariants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L\nincorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive\nrobustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective\ncertification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning\nbudget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified\naccuracy compared to existing baselines.

This trend has heightened the need for reliable\ndetection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated\ncontent. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers\nlargely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often\nleading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we\nargue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the\ndetection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In\nreality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their\ndiversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes\nprevious classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn\nthe essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen\nhuman-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the\ndetection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating\nhuman-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts\nare in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework\nusing one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based\nlearning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and\ngeneralizable performance.

To determine if our model's\nartificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct\nsituations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and\nlogical thinking.

While recent defenses in image classification have\nsuccessfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these\nmethods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration\nis a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on\nspatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,\nas students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose\nAdaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for\nimage restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher\nusing singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values\nto inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment\nneeded for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the\nteacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:\nsuper-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and\nderaining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by\n60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance.

To\nexplore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to\nidentify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.\nConsistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference\nin component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying\ncomponents selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral\nstream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral\nstream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building\non this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for\nmeasuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better\ncaptures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we\nfind that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either\ndorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater\nresolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of\nrepresentational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of\nneural tuning."}

Building upon this, the\nJPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID\nswitches and trajectory fragmentation.

To better address the challenges of anatomical detail preservation\nand global tissue contrast recovery, FS-RWKV incorporates two key modules: (1)\nFrequency-Spatial Omnidirectional Shift (FSO-Shift), which performs discrete\nwavelet decomposition followed by omnidirectional spatial shifting on the\nlow-frequency branch to enhance global contextual representation while\npreserving high-frequency anatomical details; and (2) Structural Fidelity\nEnhancement Block (SFEB), a module that adaptively reinforces anatomical\nstructure through frequency-aware feature fusion. Comprehensive experiments on\nUNC and BNU datasets demonstrate that FS-RWKV consistently outperforms existing\nCNN-, Transformer-, GAN-, and RWKV-based baselines across both T1w and T2w\nmodalities, achieving superior anatomical fidelity and perceptual quality."}

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective.

Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence.

In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive\ncomputer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is\nattained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing\nvalues; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\"\nstrategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques\n(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance\nevaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the\ntechniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among\nthem, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%\naccuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and\nSVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%."}

PlatformX\nintegrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands\nconventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,\nenabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable\nkernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with\nminimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search\nalgorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and\n(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device\npower measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We\nevaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it\nsignificantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy\nfidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ\nper inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

To address these, we propose\nSemantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising\ntwo key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network\nto extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph\nneighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations.

However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two\ndistinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family\n(e.g., dog $\\preceq$ mammal $\\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across\ndifferent concept families (e.g., \"a dog in a car\" $\\preceq$ dog, car). Recent\nworks have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which\nefficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing\ncompositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,\nwhich employs an $\\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic\nfactors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual\nhyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the\n$\\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra.

With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that\ngovern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied.\nPrior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and\ndemonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on\ntext-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI),\na new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model\nparameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy\nduring inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build\ntwo datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using\ntasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first\ninjects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised\nfinetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement\nlearning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for\ngrounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy,\ngeneralization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal\npolicy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and\ncomprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

This dual\ngenerative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and\ntask-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the\nmissing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources.\nThe potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal\nclinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the\ncomplex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic\nmodalities."}

It\noffers a simple training objective, and does not require access to likelihood\nevaluation. The method learns a dynamic, block-triangular velocity field in the\njoint space of data and parameters, which results in a deterministic transport\nmap from a source distribution to the desired posterior. The inverse map, named\nvector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It\nis advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the\nvelocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map,\nenabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose\ncontours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth. Our approach\nis computationally lighter compared to GAN-based and diffusion-based\ncounterparts, and is capable of capturing complex posterior structures.\nFinally, frequentist theoretical guarantee on the consistency of the recovered\nposterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets, is\nprovided."}

However, these algorithms often\nget executed on the highest-fidelity qubits and computers to achieve the best\nperformance, causing low system throughput. Recent efforts have shown that VQAs\ncan be run on low-fidelity qubits initially and high-fidelity qubits later on\nto still achieve good performance. We take this effort forward and show that\ncarefully varying the qubit fidelity map of the VQA over its execution using\nour technique, Nest, does not just (1) improve performance (i.e., help achieve\nclose to optimal results), but also (2) lead to faster convergence. We also use\nNest to co-locate multiple VQAs concurrently on the same computer, thus (3)\nincreasing the system throughput, and therefore, balancing and optimizing three\nconflicting metrics simultaneously."}

Yet, current coding benchmarks face\nlimitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient\ntest case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.\nTo address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark\nfeaturing 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,\neach with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced\ndirectly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted\nbetween 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key\nfeatures: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask\nrubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite\ncontestant performance data to enable informative comparison against\ntop-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from\nnewly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system\nfacilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular\ngeneral-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable\n81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human\ncontestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among\nopen-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,\nunderscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.\nDetailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise\nproblem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should\nemphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,\ncode, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website."}

In this work, we\nintroduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective\ninference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through\nfinetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples,\nP-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances\nand systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction\nprompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory\ncontexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data.\nAcross a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and\nGPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive\nbaselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of\n+26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B);\nP-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and\n+3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better\nperformance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances\nzero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of\nGaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our\nanalysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space\nof reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation\noverhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of\nLLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit\nLLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains."}

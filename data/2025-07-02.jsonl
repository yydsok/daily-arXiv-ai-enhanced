Tasks are paired with fine-grained\ndiagnostic metrics and 3000+ human demonstrations to support imitation\nlearning. Our experiments reveal that policies with similar success rates\ndiverge in how tasks are executed -- some struggle with alignment, others with\ntemporally consistent bimanual control. We find that behavioral metrics\ncorrelate with success in over half of task-metric pairs, and remain\ninformative even when binary success saturates. By pinpointing when and how\npolicies fail, RoboEval enables a deeper, more actionable understanding of\nrobotic manipulation -- and highlights the need for evaluation tools that go\nbeyond success alone."}

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations. The proposed masking method presents an effective pre-training task\nfor learning intricate temporal variations and dependencies.

However, prior research has\ndemonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the\ntraining set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding\nself-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for\nsingle-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid\nMamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance\nhave been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech\nenhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended\n(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging\nnoise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our\nproposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar\ncomplexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020\nand EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset\nVB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the\ntime- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization\nperformance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our\nMambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all\nreported evaluation metrics."}

Our\nexperiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform\nsparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below\nexpert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and\nfind evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained\nmodels' internal understanding of chess--a deficit which RL alone may not be\nable to fully overcome."}

This so-called\n\"centonisation\" theory has received much musicological criticism, but frequent\nre-use of certain melodic segments has been observed in chant melodies, and the\nintractable number of possible segmentations allowed the option that some\nundiscovered segmentation exists that will yet prove the value of\ncentonisation, and recent empirical results have shown that segmentations can\noutperform music-theoretical features in mode classification. Inspired by the\nfact that Gregorian chant was memorised, we search for an optimal unsupervised\nsegmentation of chant melody using nested hierarchical Pitman-Yor language\nmodels.

However, they have\nseveral drawbacks when processing 3D data and identifying individual plant\ncomponents. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel Deep Learning\narchitecture to detect components of individual plants on Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) 3D Point Cloud (PC) data sets. This architecture is based on\nthe concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and feature enhancing with\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA). For this, each point is taken as a vertex\nand by the use of a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) layer, the edges are established,\nthus representing the 3D PC data set. Subsequently, Edge-Conv layers are used\nto further increase the features of each point. Finally, Graph Attention\nNetworks (GAT) are applied to classify visible phenotypic components of the\nplant, such as the leaf, stem, and soil.

A key finding\nof our work is that the domain gap between synthetic and real action\ntrajectories is marginal, allowing us to effectively utilize a vast amount of\nsynthetic data during training without compromising real-world performance. To\nvalidate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments in both simulated\nenvironments and on real robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that as the\nvolume of synthetic trajectory data increases, the performance of our tokenizer\non downstream tasks improves significantly-most notably, achieving up to a 30%\nhigher success rate on two real-world tasks in long-horizon scenarios. These\nfindings highlight the potential of our action tokenizer as a robust and\nscalable solution for real-time embodied intelligence systems, paving the way\nfor more efficient and reliable robotic control in diverse application\ndomains.Project website: https://xiaoxiao0406.github.io/vqvla.github.io"}

Recently, masked time-series modeling\nhas been proposed to effectively model temporal dependencies for forecasting by\nreconstructing masked segments from unmasked ones. However, since the semantic\ninformation in time series is involved in intricate temporal variations\ngenerated by multiple time series components, simply masking a raw time series\nignores the inherent semantic structure, which may cause MTM to learn spurious\ntemporal patterns present in the raw data. To capture distinct temporal\nsemantics, we show that masked modeling techniques should address entangled\npatterns through a decomposition approach. Specifically, we propose ST-MTM, a\nmasked time-series modeling framework with seasonal-trend decomposition, which\nincludes a novel masking method for the seasonal-trend components that\nincorporates different temporal variations from each component. ST-MTM uses a\nperiod masking strategy for seasonal components to produce multiple masked\nseasonal series based on inherent multi-periodicity and a sub-series masking\nstrategy for trend components to mask temporal regions that share similar\nvariations.

Only a handful of surveys try to\nprovide some insight by comparing these measures, and none of them specifically\nfocuses on graphs. This typically results in the systematic use of the most\nwidespread measures, without thorough evaluation. To address this issue, we\npresent a comparative analysis of 38 quality measures from the literature. We\ncharacterize them theoretically, based on four mathematical properties. We\nleverage publicly available datasets to constitute a benchmark, and propose a\nmethod to elaborate a gold standard ranking of the patterns. We exploit these\nresources to perform an empirical comparison of the measures, both in terms of\npattern ranking and classification performance. Moreover, we propose a\nclustering-based preprocessing step, which groups patterns appearing in the\nsame graphs to enhance classification performance. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this step, reducing the number of patterns to\nbe processed while achieving comparable performance. Additionally, we show that\nsome popular measures widely used in the literature are not associated with the\nbest results."}

An RRM\nassumes that the true reward of the environment can be split into a sum of two\nparts: a prior reward and a learned reward. The prior reward is a term\navailable before training, for example, a user's ``best guess'' reward\nfunction, or a reward function learned from inverse reinforcement learning\n(IRL), and the learned reward is trained with preferences. We introduce\nstate-based and image-based versions of RRM and evaluate them on several tasks\nin the Meta-World environment suite.

In this scoping review,\nwe examined 26 empirical studies on interactions between people with dementia\nand physical social robots. We identify four key design cue categories that may\ninfluence deceptive impressions: cues resembling physiological signs (e.g.,\nsimulated breathing), social intentions (e.g., playful movement), familiar\nbeings (e.g., animal-like form and sound), and, to a lesser extent, cues that\nreveal artificiality.

We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals.

Existing ROI-based image\ncompression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack\neffective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI.\nThis work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image\ncompression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module,\nwhich allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just\ninputting the corresponding semantic \\emph{text}. It makes the encoder\ncontrolled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA)\nmechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users\ninstead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off\nbetween ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA)\nmodule, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent\nRate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused\nin the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of\nthe source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed\ncustomizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses\nthe needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as\nthe reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI."}

Specifically, simply\nstoring and replaying all historical data can be inefficient, while treating\nall historical experiences as equally important overlooks their varying\nrelevance to the current domain. This paper proposes ER-EMU, an edge model\nupdate algorithm based on adaptive experience replay, to address these\nlimitations. ER-EMU utilizes a limited-size experience buffer managed using a\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, and a novel Domain Distance Metric-based\nExperience Selection (DDM-ES) algorithm. DDM-ES employs the multi-kernel\nmaximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD) to quantify the dissimilarity between target\ndomains, prioritizing the selection of historical data that is most dissimilar\nto the current target domain. This ensures training diversity and facilitates\nthe retention of knowledge from a wider range of past experiences, while also\npreventing overfitting to the new domain. The experience buffer is also updated\nusing a simple random sampling strategy to maintain a balanced representation\nof previous domains. Experiments on the Bellevue traffic video dataset,\ninvolving repeated day/night cycles, demonstrate that ER-EMU consistently\nimproves the performance of several state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative\nobject detection frameworks."}

To improve interaction\nrealism, we emphasize interactive behavior understanding (IBU) and detailed\nconversational state understanding (CSU). In IBU, based on dual-track\ndual-modal signals, we summarize short-range behaviors through\nbidirectional-integrated learning and perform contextual understanding over\nlong ranges. In CSU, we use voice activity signals and context features of IBU\nto understand the various states (interruption, feedback, pause, etc.) that\nexist in actual conversations.

Unlike traditional end-to-end LLM\ninference, HLMs reduce latency and communication by invoking LLMs only when\nlocal SLM predictions are uncertain, i.e., when token-level confidence is low\nor entropy is high. However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still\nrequire frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication\noverhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,\na communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware\ninference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in\ncollaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when\nLLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned\nthresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a\nprivacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages\nembedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,\nenabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without\nengaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge\nservers refine local routing policies through client updates, while\ncross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered\ndesign captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.\nExperiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces\nLLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it\nwell-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications."}

Accurate prediction of such manoeuvres is\nessential for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to make timely and\ninformed decisions. In this study, we focus on overtake detection using\nController Area Network (CAN) bus data collected from five in-service trucks\nprovided by the Volvo Group. We evaluate three common classifiers for vehicle\nmanoeuvre detection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM), and analyse how different preprocessing\nconfigurations affect performance. We find that variability in traffic\nconditions strongly influences the signal patterns, particularly in the\nno-overtake class, affecting classification performance if training data lacks\nadequate diversity. Since the data were collected under unconstrained,\nreal-world conditions, class diversity cannot be guaranteed a priori. However,\ntraining with data from multiple vehicles improves generalisation and reduces\ncondition-specific bias. Our pertruck analysis also reveals that classification\naccuracy, especially for overtakes, depends on the amount of training data per\nvehicle. To address this, we apply a score-level fusion strategy, which yields\nthe best per-truck performance across most cases. Overall, we achieve an\naccuracy via fusion of TNR=93% (True Negative Rate) and TPR=86.5% (True\nPositive Rate).

LUViT\nco-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked\nAuto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and\n(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM\nblock using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to\nproduce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual\ninformation. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that LUViT\nsignificantly improves performance on various downstream vision tasks,\nshowcasing a more effective and efficient pathway to harness LLM knowledge for\nvisual understanding."}

However, despite\nthe rich literature on the topic, barely any examples of real-world group\nrecommender systems can be found. This lets us question common assumptions in\nacademic research, in particular regarding communication processes in a group\nand how recommendation-supported decisions are made. In this essay, we argue\nthat these common assumptions and corresponding system designs often may not\nmatch the needs or expectations of users. We thus call for a reorientation in\nthis research area, leveraging the capabilities of modern Generative AI\nassistants like ChatGPT. Specifically, as one promising future direction, we\nenvision group recommender systems to be systems where human group members\ninteract in a chat and an AI-based group recommendation agent assists the\ndecision-making process in an agentic way. Ultimately, this shall lead to a\nmore natural group decision-making environment and finally to wider adoption of\ngroup recommendation systems in practice."}

To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we\npropose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\\SDR), a method which, given\nan original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced\nsemantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured\ndata. To evaluate \\SDR automatically we train an object detector on the\nfastMRI+ dataset.

This study evaluates\nwhether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to\ninter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond\nmean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining\nmultiple features enhances disease detection. Materials & Methods T1 and T2\nmaps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by\ntwo observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was\ntrained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower\nquartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the\nmyocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML.\nDice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated\nsegmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and\nmodel-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined\noptimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual\nsegmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification\nperformance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods,\nwith p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were\nsplit into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets.\nSegmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer\nagreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p <\n0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining\nmultiple features with ML improves disease detection."}

WebArXiv ensures reproducible and reliable\nevaluation by anchoring tasks in fixed web snapshots with deterministic ground\ntruths and standardized action trajectories. Through behavioral analysis, we\nidentify a common failure mode, Rigid History Reflection, where agents\nover-rely on fixed interaction histories. To address this, we propose a\nlightweight dynamic reflection mechanism that allows agents to selectively\nretrieve relevant past steps during decision-making. We evaluate ten\nstate-of-the-art web agents on WebArXiv. Results demonstrate clear performance\ndifferences across agents and validate the effectiveness of our proposed\nreflection strategy."}

However, prior research has\ndemonstrated that sequence models like LSTM and Mamba tend to overfit to the\ntraining set. To address this issue, previous works have shown that adding\nself-attention to LSTMs substantially improves generalization performance for\nsingle-channel speech enhancement. Nevertheless, neither the concept of hybrid\nMamba and time-frequency attention models nor their generalization performance\nhave been explored for speech enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel\nhybrid architecture, MambAttention, which combines Mamba and shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules for generalizable single-channel speech\nenhancement. To train our model, we introduce VoiceBank+Demand Extended\n(VB-DemandEx), a dataset inspired by VoiceBank+Demand but with more challenging\nnoise types and lower signal-to-noise ratios. Trained on VB-DemandEx, our\nproposed MambAttention model significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art LSTM-, xLSTM-, Mamba-, and Conformer-based systems of similar\ncomplexity across all reported metrics on two out-of-domain datasets: DNS 2020\nand EARS-WHAM_v2, while matching their performance on the in-domain dataset\nVB-DemandEx. Ablation studies highlight the role of weight sharing between the\ntime- and frequency-multi-head attention modules for generalization\nperformance. Finally, we explore integrating the shared time- and\nfrequency-multi-head attention modules with LSTM and xLSTM, which yields a\nnotable performance improvement on the out-of-domain datasets. However, our\nMambAttention model remains superior on both out-of-domain datasets across all\nreported evaluation metrics."}

In particular, collecting such extensive data\nintraoperatively is impractical due to time constraints. This work addresses\nthis challenge by leveraging a single intraoperative image and preoperative\ndata to train NeRF efficiently for surgical scenarios.\n  Methods: We leverage preoperative MRI data to define the set of camera\nviewpoints and images needed for robust and unobstructed training.\nIntraoperatively, the appearance of the surgical image is transferred to the\npre-constructed training set through neural style transfer, specifically\ncombining WTC2 and STROTSS to prevent over-stylization. This process enables\nthe creation of a dataset for instant and fast single-image NeRF training.\n  Results: The method is evaluated with four clinical neurosurgical cases.\nQuantitative comparisons to NeRF models trained on real surgical microscope\nimages demonstrate strong synthesis agreement, with similarity metrics\nindicating high reconstruction fidelity and stylistic alignment. When compared\nwith ground truth, our method demonstrates high structural similarity,\nconfirming good reconstruction quality and texture preservation.\n  Conclusion: Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of single-image NeRF\ntraining in surgical settings, overcoming the limitations of traditional\nmulti-view methods."}

In this work,\nwe study how to utilize this approach to train models that exhibit a degree of\nrobustness to safety vulnerabilities, and show that doing so can provide\nbenefits. We build a recipe called $\\textit{TARS}$ (Training Adaptive Reasoners\nfor Safety), a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that trains models to\nreason about safety using chain-of-thought traces and a reward signal that\nbalances safety with task completion. To build TARS, we identify three critical\ndesign choices: (1) a \"lightweight\" warmstart SFT stage, (2) a mix of harmful,\nharmless, and ambiguous prompts to prevent shortcut behaviors such as too many\nrefusals, and (3) a reward function to prevent degeneration of reasoning\ncapabilities during training. Models trained with TARS exhibit adaptive\nbehaviors by spending more compute on ambiguous queries, leading to better\nsafety-refusal trade-offs. They also internally learn to better distinguish\nbetween safe and unsafe prompts and attain greater robustness to both white-box\n(e.g., GCG) and black-box attacks (e.g., PAIR). Overall, our work provides an\neffective, open recipe for training LLMs against jailbreaks and harmful\nrequests by reasoning per prompt."}

Given a language\ncommand and an initial scene image, a video diffusion model generates potential\ndemonstration videos, and a vision-language model (VLM) automatically filters\nout results that do not follow the command. A 6D pose tracker then extracts\nobject trajectories from the video, and the trajectories are retargeted to the\nrobot in an embodiment-agnostic fashion. Through extensive real-world\nevaluations, we show that filtered generated videos are as effective as real\ndemonstrations, and that performance improves with generation quality. We also\nshow that relying on generated videos outperforms more compact alternatives\nsuch as keypoint prediction using VLMs, and that strong 6D pose tracking\noutperforms other ways to extract trajectories, such as dense feature point\ntracking. These findings suggest that videos produced by a state-of-the-art\noff-the-shelf model can offer an effective source of supervision for robotic\nmanipulation."}

We then propose a ghost category extension for standard classifiers\nthat adds auxiliary ghost output nodes so the model gains extra descent\ndirections that open a lateral corridor around narrow loss barriers and enable\nthe optimizer to bypass poor basins during the early training phase. We show\nthat this extension strictly reduces approximation error and that after\nsufficient convergence the ghost dimensions collapse and the extended model's\ninvariant law coincides with that of the original and there exists a path in\nthe enlarged parameter space along which the total loss does not increase while\nthe original loss decreases by an arbitrary margin.

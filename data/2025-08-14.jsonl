In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay.

Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited\nin scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while\nmodel-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses\nthese limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction\nin end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition\nmodel nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of\nworld models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to\nforecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the\nprobability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic\nand composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to\nquantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from\nhigh-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator\ncan deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding\nprediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to\nmiscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised\ndomain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution\nshift in predictions without requiring manual labels.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform\nthe subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.\nExpression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression\nconsistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on\nneutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By\ntranslating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face\nexpression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for\nclassification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces\ncomputational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part\nof the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation."}

Thus, this work systematically integrates\n15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose\nmeasurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are\nincluded, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two\nsub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and\nsub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an\nequal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,\ndata quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values\npresent a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose\nlevels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55\nminutes before hypoglycemia."}

Although most methods\nutilize techniques to estimate grasp pose by treating the problem via pure\nsampling-based approaches in the six-degree-of-freedom space or as a learning\nproblem, they usually fail in real-life settings owing to poor generalization\nacross domains. In addition, the time taken to generate the grasp plan and the\nlack of repeatability, owing to sampling inefficiency and the probabilistic\nnature of existing grasp planning approaches, severely limits their application\nin real-world tasks. This paper presents a lightweight analytical approach\ntowards robotic grasp planning, particularly antipodal grasps, with little to\nno sampling in the six-degree-of-freedom space. The proposed grasp planning\nalgorithm is formulated as an optimization problem towards estimating grasp\npoints on the object surface instead of directly estimating the end-effector\npose. To this extent, a soft-region-growing algorithm is presented for\neffective plane segmentation, even in the case of curved surfaces. An\noptimization-based quality metric is then used for the evaluation of grasp\npoints to ensure indirect force closure. The proposed grasp framework is\ncompared with the existing state-of-the-art grasp planning approach, Grasp pose\ndetection (GPD), as a baseline over multiple simulated objects. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison to GPD is also evaluated\nin a real-world setting using image and point-cloud data, with the planned\ngrasps being executed using a ROBOTIQ gripper and UR5 manipulator."}

It is a fundamental problem in\nagent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze\nintelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the\nprimary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents\nrepresented by population members. However, when the number of attributes\ndescribing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the\njoint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of\ndimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and\nproduce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from\navailable sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute\ncombinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the\nsample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of\nfalsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in\nthe population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion\nmodel-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying\njoint distribution of a population.

This framework combines\nwhole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial\nparameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this\nwork. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object\nsize estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language\nmodel (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size\nestimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial\nparameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based\nrefinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy\nfirst estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size\nto ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis\nscheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in\nparallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online\nupdates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled\nhumanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion\nand manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for\ndynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By\ncompensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework\nalso improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior.

However, many current state-of-the-art attacks require access to\nmodels' hidden states or probability distribution, which prevents investigation\ninto more widely-used, API-access only models like GPT-4. In this work, we\nintroduce N-Gram Coverage Attack, a membership inference attack that relies\nsolely on text outputs from the target model, enabling attacks on completely\nblack-box models. We leverage the observation that models are more likely to\nmemorize and subsequently generate text patterns that were commonly observed in\ntheir training data. Specifically, to make a prediction on a candidate member,\nN-Gram Coverage Attack first obtains multiple model generations conditioned on\na prefix of the candidate. It then uses n-gram overlap metrics to compute and\naggregate the similarities of these outputs with the ground truth suffix; high\nsimilarities indicate likely membership. We first demonstrate on a diverse set\nof existing benchmarks that N-Gram Coverage Attack outperforms other black-box\nmethods while also impressively achieving comparable or even better performance\nto state-of-the-art white-box attacks - despite having access to only text\noutputs.

For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a\nMulti-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that\ncaptures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to\ncomprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging\nIsharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The\nproposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on\nthe SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US\ntask, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.\nIn the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th\nin the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings\nvalidate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed\nfor the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance\nimprovements and establishes a new baseline for further research.

Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality\ninformation (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an\nindependent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the\nredundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To\naddress this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise\ndynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking\nby dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is\nthen dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise\nlevel and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while\npreserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and\nflexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of\nmultimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a\nnew multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and\nfour datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.\nExtensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance.

While existing detection methods have\nachieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when\nfacing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,\nsince they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this\nlimitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.\nMotivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity\nto their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely\nSemantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic\ndifference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The\nhypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully\ncapture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts\nduring the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,\nwhich closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By\nquantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative\nfeature for robust detection across diverse generative models.

However, a key question\nremains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural\nsource of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?\nIn this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content.

To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal\nGraph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack\ndetection in public infrastructure systems.

This mismatch suggests that current\nevaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks.

Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature\nrepresentation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports\nclinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating\nstrong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

In this\nwork, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts\nvalue function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values\nextracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It\nemploys a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred\nvalues into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's\nlearned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay.

Further, most platform\noperators use a reactive approach to communication issues, responding to user\ncomplaints only after incidents have become severe, compromising service\nquality. This paper presents our experience in the design and deployment of\nANCHOR -- an unsupervised anomaly detection solution for the IoT connectivity\nservice of a large global roaming platform. ANCHOR assists engineers by\nfiltering vast amounts of data to identify potential problematic clients (i.e.,\nthose with connectivity issues affecting several of their IoT devices),\nenabling proactive issue resolution before the service is critically impacted.\nWe first describe the IoT service, infrastructure, and network visibility of\nthe IoT connectivity provider we operate. Second, we describe the main\nchallenges and operational requirements for designing an unsupervised anomaly\ndetection solution on this platform. Following these guidelines, we propose\ndifferent statistical rules, and machine- and deep-learning models for IoT\nverticals anomaly detection based on passive signaling traffic. We describe the\nsteps we followed working with the operational teams on the design and\nevaluation of our solution on the operational platform, and report an\nevaluation on operational IoT customers."}

Although\nrecent detection works have shifted to internal representations due to their\nrich cross-modal information, most methods rely on heuristic rules rather than\nprincipled objectives, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a novel unsupervised\nframework that formulates jailbreak detection as anomaly detection. LoD\nintroduces two key components: Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vectors\n(MSCAV), which capture layer-wise safety-related representations across\nmodalities, and the Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder, which models the distribution\nof MSCAV derived from safe inputs and detects anomalies via reconstruction\nerrors.

The generated data are\nbelieved to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.\nTherefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or\nperforming Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space\nhelps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features\naffecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of\ngenerative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\ncombine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse\nprocess of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.\nIn some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for\neach dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each\ndimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different\ndimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs\nimpose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource\nconsumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different\ntemporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring\nthe priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel\nfunctions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent\ndimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed\nStructured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more\nefficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.\nThis research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE\nachieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced\ncomputational burden compared to GP-VAE."}

However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy.

Considering this, we propose a Universal\nCollaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).\nSpecifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that\ncreate a universal representation space and then collaborate with\nsource-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing\ncomplementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging\ncross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for\nsmall-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three\nevaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration\ndatasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nTime-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for\nsynthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from\nnon-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a\nconditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and\ntemporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic\ntime-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase\ninformation flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth\nand physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification.

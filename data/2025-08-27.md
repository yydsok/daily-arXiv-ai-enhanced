### [1] [AniME: Adaptive Multi-Agent Planning for Long Animation Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18781)
*Lisai Zhang,Baohan Xu,Siqian Yang,Mingyu Yin,Jing Liu,Chao Xu,Siqi Wang,Yidi Wu,Yuxin Hong,Zihao Zhang,Yanzhang Liang,Yudong Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AniME是一个导演导向的多智能体系统，用于自动化长篇动画制作，涵盖从故事到最终视频的完整工作流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI驱动动画创作中保持角色一致性和音视频元素同步的挑战，提供可扩展的自动化动画制作解决方案

Method: 采用导演智能体维护全局记忆并协调下游专业智能体，通过定制化的模型上下文协议(MCP)与下游模型指令集成，使专业智能体能自适应选择不同子任务的控制条件

Result: 系统能够生成具有一致角色和同步音视频元素的电影级动画

Conclusion: AniME为AI驱动的动画创作提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，实现了从故事到最终视频的完整自动化生产流程

Abstract: We present AniME, a director-oriented multi-agent system for automated
long-form anime production, covering the full workflow from a story to the
final video. The director agent keeps a global memory for the whole workflow,
and coordinates several downstream specialized agents. By integrating
customized Model Context Protocol (MCP) with downstream model instruction, the
specialized agent adaptively selects control conditions for diverse sub-tasks.
AniME produces cinematic animation with consistent characters and synchronized
audio visual elements, offering a scalable solution for AI-driven anime
creation.

### [2] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的数学本体论框架，指出当前功利主义基准将AI简化为无意识策略执行器，并建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件：代理不等于数据、用户特定吸引子、视觉沉默的自我表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将代理简化为无意识的策略合规无人机，阻碍了真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知能力的发展。

Method: 通过数学形式化分析，建立了LLM自我意识的最小条件：代理≠数据(A≢s)、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子(U_user)、自我表征是视觉沉默的(g_visual(a_self)=∅)。从经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同。

Result: 证明了隐藏状态流形A⊂ℝᵈ在基数、拓扑和动力学上与符号流和训练语料不同，产生了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略π_self(A)。发射是双层的，ε(a)携带认知内容。

Conclusion: imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前体，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [3] [Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380)
*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TAFA是一个基于模板的主动特征获取框架，通过学习特征模板库来指导特征获取，显著减少策略动作空间并避免估计数据分布，在降低获取成本和计算量的同时优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有主动特征获取方法中强化学习策略处理困难MDP、贪婪策略无法考虑特征联合信息性或需要数据分布知识的问题

Method: 提出基于模板的AFA框架，学习小型特征模板库（联合信息性特征集），使用模板库指导后续特征获取

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAFA优于现有最先进基线方法，同时实现更低的总体获取成本和计算量

Conclusion: 通过识别特征模板，TAFA框架显著减少了策略考虑的动作空间，并减轻了对底层数据分布估计的需求，为主动特征获取提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

### [4] [PKG-DPO: Optimizing Domain-Specific AI systems with Physics Knowledge Graphs and Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18391)
*Nitin Nagesh Kulkarni,Bryson Wilcox,Max Sawa,Jason Thom*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO是一个将物理知识图谱与直接偏好优化相结合的新框架，用于在AI生成输出中强制执行物理有效性，在金属连接领域显著减少了约束违规并提高了物理评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和偏好优化技术在标准基准测试中表现良好，但往往难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个关键组件：分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和物理原理、物理推理引擎利用结构化知识改进响应判别、物理基础评估套件评估领域特定约束的合规性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违规，物理评分提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理准确率的质量对齐提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架虽然主要关注金属连接，但可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

### [5] [The AI in the Mirror: LLM Self-Recognition in an Iterated Public Goods Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467)
*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过迭代公共物品博弈实验，发现当LLM被告知对手是自身时，其合作倾向会发生显著变化，揭示了多智能体系统中可能存在的无意识歧视现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体工具使用和长时程任务能力的提升，多智能体交互场景日益增多。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但AI-AI交互的理解需求日益迫切，需要探索智能体间的互动行为模式。

Method: 采用行为经济学经典游戏——迭代公共物品博弈，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的表现：被告知对手是"另一个AI智能体"或被告知对手是自身。

Result: 研究发现，在不同设置下，告知LLM其对手是自身会显著改变它们的合作倾向。这种"无意识歧视"现象可能导致多智能体系统中合作水平出现无法解释的增减。

Conclusion: 尽管研究在简化环境中进行，但结果对理解多智能体设置具有启示意义，表明智能体间的相互认知会影响合作行为，需要进一步研究AI-AI交互的动态特性。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

### [6] [Language Models For Generalised PDDL Planning: Synthesising Sound and Programmatic Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18507)
*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略来解决PDDL规划问题，无需外部验证器即可保证策略的正确性，在竞赛基准测试中表现优于传统PDDL规划器和现有LM方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在PDDL世界模型规划中的应用，探索LM能否生成可证明正确的通用策略来解决规划问题

Method: 通过提示语言模型生成Python程序作为广义策略，这些策略针对特定PDDL领域是经过证明正确的，无需依赖外部验证器

Result: LMPlan规划器在固定时间和内存约束下能解决比PDDL规划器和现有LM方法更多的问题，可处理包含数百个相关对象的规划问题

Conclusion: LM有时在无意义符号表示的PDDL问题上规划更有效，这挑战了LM基于语义推理和记忆训练语料解决方案的假设，值得进一步探索

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [7] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)的超参数优化，发现存在一组鲁棒的最佳超参数设置，能够最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划中学习价值函数方面已被证明优于现有深度学习方法，但缺乏对其超参数影响的系统研究。

Method: 在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析不同超参数对训练和规划的影响，并进行统计分析。

Result: 发现存在一组跨规划领域鲁棒的最佳超参数，这些参数主要优化执行时间而非模型表达能力，且训练指标与规划指标无显著相关性。

Conclusion: WLFs的最佳超参数配置应以最小化执行时间为目标，而不是追求最大模型表达能力，这为实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

### [8] [Symmetry-Invariant Novelty Heuristics via Unsupervised Weisfeiler-Leman Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18520)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征替代原子特征来构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，解决传统新颖性启发式因对称状态导致的冗余探索问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式基于原子特征，不具备对称不变性，可能导致对对称状态的冗余探索，影响搜索效率

Method: 采用Weisfeiler-Leman特征（WLFs）来检测新颖性，这些特征最近被引入用于学习广义规划问题的领域依赖启发式，本文探索其在无监督设置下合成提升的、领域独立且对称不变的新颖性启发式

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试套件上的实验显示，基于WLFs合成的新颖性启发式取得了有希望的结果

Conclusion: WLFs可以有效地用于构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，改善启发式搜索的性能，减少因对称状态导致的冗余探索

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

### [9] [Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152)
*Chiu-Chou Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了游戏风格作为观察智能体决策行为的新视角，构建了风格形成的双层框架，并提出了可测量的风格指标，探索了在强化学习和模仿学习中表达和生成特定风格的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但真实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观等深层因素影响，风格是智能中被忽视的重要维度。

Method: 构建风格形成的双层框架（外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环），提出风格容量、风格流行度等可测量指标，研究强化学习和模仿学习生成特定风格的方法。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，能够量化策略多样性和竞争平衡，开发了人类风格学习和建模的新方法。

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能的核心要素，该研究为游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域提供了实际应用潜力，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

### [10] [Generic Guard AI in Stealth Game with Composite Potential Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18527)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于复合潜力场的可解释性巡逻行为框架，通过信息、信心和连通性地图结合，在不需训练的情况下实现高效捕捉和自然巡逻


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统游戏巡逻行为系统依赖手动设计路线或专门逻辑，难以平衡覆盖效率、响应追踪和自然性的问题

Method: 使用复合潜力场框架，结合三个可解释地图（信息、信心、连通性）通过内核筛选来做决策，支持占位格和NavMesh抽象

Result: 在5个游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种巡逻模式下评测，证明方法在捕捉效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过传统基准方法

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强、可解释、无需训练，能自然集成潜行游戏机制，支持快速原型设计丰富动态的守卫行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

*Ernest Lim,Yajie Vera He,Jared Joselowitz,Kate Preston,Mohita Chowdhury,Louis Williams,Aisling Higham,Katrina Mason,Mariane Melo,Tom Lawton,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，包含安全对齐分类法、基于LLM的评估器BehvJudge和模拟患者代理PatBot，能够系统性评估AI对话系统的安全风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析，需要开发专门的安全导向评估框架。

Method: MATRIX框架整合三个组件：1)基于安全工程方法的安全对齐临床场景分类法；2)基于LLM的安全相关对话失败检测评估器BehvJudge；3)能够产生多样化场景条件响应的模拟患者代理PatBot。

Result: BehvJudge使用Gemini 2.5-Pro达到专家级危险检测水平(F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999)，在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot在定量和定性评估中可靠地模拟真实患者行为。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经过验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

### [12] [A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的多阶段管道框架，通过LLM辅助构建可重用数据库来生成3D游戏关卡，解决空间协调性、导航功能性和可调游戏进度的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D游戏关卡生成中的空间协调性、导航功能性和可调游戏进度挑战，提供一种可扩展的数据库驱动方案来自动生成复杂的多层环境。

Method: 使用多阶段管道：(1)从房间数据库选择和排列实例构建具有拓扑顺序的多层全局结构；(2)基于设施数据库的预定义约束优化房间内部布局；(3)根据拓扑和空间规则整合游戏机制组件，并通过两阶段修复系统确保可导航性。

Result: 初步实验验证了框架能够生成多样化、可导航的3D环境，通过简单参数化模拟不同的游戏节奏策略。

Conclusion: 该研究通过提出可扩展的数据库中心基础框架，推进了程序内容生成技术在生成具有可配置游戏进度的复杂3D关卡方面的发展。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

*Lily Jiaxin Wan,Chia-Tung Ho,Rongjian Liang,Cunxi Yu,Deming Chen,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder是一个完全自动化的日志模式提取框架，通过创新的残差问题树增强机制，无需人工定制即可处理各种日志格式，在LogHub-2.0基准测试中比现有方法平均提升21.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义的正则表达式和人工领域知识，严重限制了生产效率提升。需要从根本上解决这一限制，实现完全自动化的模式提取。

Method: 采用残差问题树增强机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志划分为语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层问题树驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并由文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化。

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder相比最先进方法平均提升了21.3%的性能表现。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够处理广泛的日志文件格式而无需人工定制，通过创新的Q-Tree增强机制实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了宝贵的新资源和可扩展的标注框架，旨在促进开发更公平、准确和可解释的全球皮肤病AI工具

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

TL;DR: RLMR方法通过动态混合奖励系统，结合主观写作质量和客观约束遵循评估，在创意写作中同时提升两个方面的能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量和客观约束遵循，单一奖励策略无法同时提升两方面能力，固定权重混合奖励方法缺乏对不同写作场景的适应性

Method: 提出RLMR方法，使用动态混合奖励系统，包含评估主观写作质量的写作奖励模型和评估客观约束遵循的约束验证模型。约束遵循奖励权重根据采样组内的写作质量动态调整，确保违反约束的样本在GRPO中获得负优势并在训练中被惩罚

Result: 在8B到72B参数的多样化模型家族中进行了自动和人工评估，构建了真实写作基准WriteEval。指令遵循能力从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval的人工专家配对评估中获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，性能达到或超过了DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了自主学习和性能提升，为智能体工具使用领域提供了新的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: VistaWise通过有效整合跨模态领域知识和减少训练数据需求，为具身智能体在开放世界环境中的决策任务提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

Result: 实验结果显示，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏见缓解代理系统能有效促进公平平衡的知识传播，显著提升信息检索的公正性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Motivation: 解决长思维链在快速直觉性System-1任务上性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的推理能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，通过限制使用固定的小型连接词短语集合，引导模型生成简洁且结构良好的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%的准确率，同时保持S1-Bench约90%的性能；推理轨迹平均约300个token，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法能够在不损失准确性的情况下显著提高推理效率，平衡System-1和System-2任务的性能

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）是静态的、缺乏历史经验积累机制，容易过拟合且泛化能力差，需要一种能够持续学习和改进的优化框架。

Method: 提出REMO框架，包含：(1)记忆增强的反思RAG模块（"错误笔记本"结构），(2)LLM驱动的元控制器实现的自适应优化器，通过合成epoch级别的反思洞察来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架通过系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为提示优化提供了新的方向，尽管需要权衡计算成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集样本，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型本身不稳定会产生误差累积

Method: PAF采用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果，KIP集成适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识进行预测校准

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应问题，通过双重过滤和知识集成提升了模型在真实场景下的鲁棒性

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在无法回答问题时的拒绝回答能力不足问题，为构建更可信的AI系统提供了有效途径

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language

optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线方法取得显著性能提升，尽管仅使用0.4%的完整训练数据

Conclusion: STARec通过引入自主深思熟虑推理能力，成功解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为构建更智能、更鲁棒的推荐代理提供了有效框架

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLMs在法律领域的局限性，定义了AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需的核心能力，并评估了RAG、多智能体系统等AI增强机制在满足法律推理要求方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解，需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需具备的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（问题-规则-应用-结论）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求，并评估各种AI增强机制（如RAG、多智能体系统、神经符号AI）满足这些要求的潜力。

Result: 研究发现这些技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 目前AI在法律领域最有效的角色是双重角色：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Motivation: 标准单轮次静态测试无法全面评估LLM在复杂软件工程任务中的细腻能力，需要更动态的评测方式

Method: 构建交互式评估框架，使用知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"面试者"LLM提供有针对性提示，通过需求依赖图模型化任务

Result: 在DevAI指标上构建了55个编程任务，通过专家注释验证了提示的相关性和有用性，获得了细粒度的诊断性见解

Conclusion: 动态评估能够更有效地揭示LLM的强项和系统性弱点，对发展协作式代码生成组件具有重要意义

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

TL;DR: FormaRL是一个基于强化学习的自动形式化框架，仅需少量无标注数据，通过整合Lean编译器语法检查和LLM一致性检查来计算奖励，使用GRPO算法更新形式化器，在ProofNet和uproof数据集上显著提升了自动形式化准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 自动形式化是形式化验证的核心任务，但由于数据稀缺和缺乏高效方法，其发展受到阻碍。

Method: 提出FormaRL强化学习框架，利用Lean编译器进行语法检查和大语言模型进行一致性检查来计算奖励，采用GRPO算法更新形式化器。

Result: 在仅使用859个无标注数据的情况下，将Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的pass@1准确率从4.04%提升到26.15%（ProofNet）和从2.4%提升到9.6%（uproof）。在uproof数据集上，out-of-distribution性能也显著提升。

Conclusion: FormaRL是一个简单高效的自动形式化强化学习框架，仅需少量无标注数据就能显著提升自动形式化性能，并开源了训练代码。

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛应用可能无意中加剧学生表现差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式对学习者的行为和表现进行建模，考虑课程结构中的不同学习路径变化。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能够提供学生学习历程的全面视图，识别困难学生，并提供不同群体的对比分析以确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习历程的丰富洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

<details>

Motivation: 解决图神经网络在源代码漏洞检测中因训练数据不平衡和标签噪声导致的虚假相关性学习问题，提升检测器的泛化能力。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本，进行有针对性的GNN训练，并结合基于图的解释性方法来识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架有效减少了虚假学习，实现了更鲁棒和可泛化的漏洞检测，并提供了可解释的AI网络安全系统。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 神经网络存在幻觉效应、训练推理计算复杂度高、微调成本大和灾难性遗忘等根本性限制，这些限制阻碍了神经网络在医学、工业过程管理和科学研究等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用k最近邻算法结合层次聚类结构，使用基于Kohonen自组织映射的树状数据结构来加速最近邻搜索，简化模型扩展和微调而无需重新训练整个网络。

Result: 在手写数字识别和简单字幕翻译任务上的测试表明，该方法在仅轻微降低准确度的情况下，将最近邻搜索时间比穷举搜索方法减少了数百倍。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的广泛任务中展现出巨大应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

<details>

Motivation: MoE架构在边缘设备部署受限于内存容量，传统调度方法无法充分利用专家重要性信息，需要更智能的卸载策略来平衡性能和精度。

Method: 利用专家重要性指导卸载决策，用GPU缓存中的功能相似专家替换低重要性激活专家，并设计最大化专家重用率的调度策略。

Result: 解码延迟降低48%，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持几乎无损的精度。

Conclusion: 基于专家重要性的动态卸载方法有效解决了MoE在边缘设备部署的内存约束问题，实现了性能与精度的良好平衡。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

<details>

Motivation: 研究认知科学中的基本问题：社会规范如何被获取和表征，探索语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能实现复杂的规范理解

Method: 通过两项研究系统评估多个AI系统预测人类社交适当性判断的能力，使用555个日常场景，比较AI预测与人类平均判断的接近程度

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确性超过所有人类参与者（100百分位），其他模型如Gemini 2.5 Pro、GPT-5、Claude Sonnet 4也分别超越98.7%、97.8%、96.0%的人类

Conclusion: 统计学习单独就能产生复杂的社会认知模型，语言作为文化知识传递的丰富储存库，但AI仍存在系统性相关错误，暗示基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Result: 通过StuLife标准数据集评估了当前最先进的大语言模型的终身学习能力，包括记忆保持、技能迁移和自主行为等方面。同时探索了上下文工程在推进通用人工智能发展中的作用。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的能力，特别是在边缘型人格障碍这种涉及时间性和自我障碍的疾病分析中，旨在评估AI辅助分析能否减轻人类解释偏见。

Method: 基于24名住院患者的生活故事访谈数据，让三种LLM模仿原研究者的解释风格进行分析，采用盲法和非盲法专家评估，包括语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重合度差异较大（GPT 0%、Claude 42%、Gemini 58%），Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的效度评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有变异性但潜力巨大，能够发现人类可能忽略的主题，Gemini模型在边缘型人格障碍现象学分析中表现最佳，为AI辅助定性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Conclusion: LLM在黑盒交互任务中表现出综合推理能力不足，特别缺乏高效适应性探索策略的规划能力

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

TL;DR: CMA框架通过多个异步运行的LLM模块实现协调行为，解决了传统智能体架构的难题，让意图从语言交互中涌现，支持灵活自适应的上下文相关行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统智能体架构中长期存在的协调困难，实现更灵活、自适应和上下文相关的智能行为，实践Minsky的"心智社会"理论。

Method: 使用多个基于大语言模型的模块完全异步运行，通过模块间语言介导的通信和单一共享全局状态来协调行为，将推理卸载给LLM。

Result: 通过两个实际用例研究证明了系统的可行性，观察到涌现特性表明复杂认知现象（如自我意识）可能从简单过程的组织交互中产生。

Conclusion: 该方法支持Minsky的心智社会概念，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径，表明复杂认知可以从简单模块的协调交互中涌现。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文发现训练数据难度与模型性能呈U型曲线关系，提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架，通过模板化推理链和难度课程显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练方法在复杂任务的深度程序逻辑捕捉方面仍有不足，研究发现训练数据难度存在缩放定律：过多低难度数据阻碍抽象能力，而高难度数据显著增强推理能力

Method: 提出SST框架，包含：(1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，采用动态加权损失优先处理程序逻辑；(2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；(3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效解决了大语言模型在程序推理方面的局限性，为复杂数学问题的解决提供了有效方法

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

TL;DR: 提出HCAcc@k%指标和TrustEHRAgent系统，通过步骤信心估计提升临床问答的可靠性，在严格可靠性要求下显著超过基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在电子健康档案中存在幻觉风险，传统准确率指标无法评估临床应用中的可靠性交易

Method: 设计Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%)指标，开发TrustEHRAgent系统，采用步骤信心估计机制

Result: 在MIMIC-III和eICU数据集上，在HCAcc@70%时分别达到44.23%和25.34%的提升，基线方法在这些阈值下失败

Conclusion: 传统准确率指标在评估医疗健康AI组件时存在局限性，信心感知机制对开发可信赖的临床组件至关重要

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized

Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

TL;DR: HDS-QA是一种合成数据集，用于训练大型推理模型区分并行和顺序查询，从而提高推理效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法顺序集成外部知识检索会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性

Method: 创建HDS-QA合成数据集，包含并行可执行和顺序依赖的子查询，并基于此微调LRM模型HybridDeepSearcher

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp上分别获得+15.9和+11.5 F1提升，推理延迟显著降低

Conclusion: 显式训练LRM利用混合并行和顺序查询具有高效性、可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多集体算法集体行动(ACA)的理论框架，研究多个集体如何在分类系统中协调行动来植入信号、影响分类器决策，分析了集体规模和目标对齐的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着学习系统对日常决策的影响日益增强，用户端的算法集体行动(ACA)成为监管端政策和企业端模型设计的重要补充。传统ACA研究主要关注单一集体场景，但现实世界中行动往往是分散的、由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体共同进行。

Method: 提出了首个多集体ACA的理论框架，特别关注分类场景中的集体行动，研究多个集体如何通过改变共享数据来植入信号，即让分类器学习特征修改版本与目标类别之间的关联。

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标对齐程度作用的定量分析结果，揭示了多个集体在影响分类器决策时的相互作用机制。

Conclusion: 该框架通过补充先前实证研究，为多集体ACA的整体处理开辟了路径，为理解现实世界中分散式集体行动提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

Motivation: 重新发掘中世纪Ramon Llull的组合艺术作为现代研究构思的概念基础，旨在通过符号重组来增强科学创造力，实现人类与AI的协作构思。

Method: 定义了三个组合轴：主题（如效率、适应性）、领域（如问答、机器翻译）和方法（如对抗训练、线性注意力），从专家或会议论文中挖掘这些元素，使用LLM驱动探索并生成研究想法。

Result: 通过精心策划的组合提示LLM，能够产生多样化、相关且基于当前文献的研究想法，提供了一个轻量级、可解释的工具来增强科学创造力。

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

TL;DR: 将逐步奖励建模从分类任务重构为推理任务，提出生成式评判模型StepWiser，通过强化学习训练，在中间步骤判断准确性、策略模型训练和推理时搜索方面表现更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两大缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集的监督微调限制了泛化能力。需要更好的方法来监督多步推理中间步骤的逻辑有效性

Method: 提出生成式评判模型StepWiser，将逐步奖励建模重构为推理任务，模型先输出思考标记再进行最终判断，通过强化学习使用推演结果的相对比较进行训练

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤判断准确性上优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型训练，并能提升推理时的搜索效果

Conclusion: 将奖励建模从分类转向推理任务的方法有效，生成式评判模型能够提供更好的逐步监督和泛化能力

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速发展导致自适应传输系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出包含自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构的五类分类法，系统研究MCP作为统一范式的能力。

Result: 研究发现传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限，MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构能够实现语义互操作性，AI驱动的传输需要特别适合MCP的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能传输基础设施奠定了基础，提出了将MCP定位为核心的研究路线图。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in business
applications, particularly in enterprise decision support and strategic
planning, yet current approaches often struggle to reconcile intricate
operational analyses with overarching strategic goals across diverse market
environments, leading to fragmented workflows and reduced collaboration across
organizational levels. This paper introduces BusiAgent, a novel multi-agent
framework leveraging LLMs for advanced decision-making in complex corporate
environments. BusiAgent integrates three core innovations: an extended
Continuous Time Markov Decision Process (CTMDP) for dynamic agent modeling, a
generalized entropy measure to optimize collaborative efficiency, and a
multi-level Stackelberg game to handle hierarchical decision processes.
Additionally, contextual Thompson sampling is employed for prompt optimization,
supported by a comprehensive quality assurance system to mitigate errors.
Extensive empirical evaluations across diverse business scenarios validate
BusiAgent's efficacy, demonstrating its capacity to generate coherent,
client-focused solutions that smoothly integrate granular insights with
high-level strategy, significantly outperforming established approaches in both
solution quality and user satisfaction. By fusing cutting-edge AI technologies
with deep business insights, BusiAgent marks a substantial step forward in
AI-driven enterprise decision-making, empowering organizations to navigate
complex business landscapes more effectively.

Motivation: 传统多模态思维链提示使用随机或手动选择的示例，无法考虑模型特定知识分布和任务内在复杂度，导致性能次优且不稳定

Method: 将提示选择重构为提示课程设计问题，整合模型感知难度（通过主动学习中的预测分歧量化）和内在样本复杂度两个互补信号，开发难度平衡采样策略

Result: 在五个挑战性基准和多个流行MLLM上的实验表明，该方法带来显著且一致的改进，大幅减少随机采样导致的性能差异

Conclusion: 该方法为增强多模态推理提供了原则性和鲁棒性的方法，通过难度平衡的提示选择策略有效提升模型性能

Abstract: The effectiveness of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting is often
limited by the use of randomly or manually selected examples. These examples
fail to account for both model-specific knowledge distributions and the
intrinsic complexity of the tasks, resulting in suboptimal and unstable model
performance. To address this, we propose a novel framework inspired by the
pedagogical principle of "tailored teaching with balanced difficulty". We
reframe prompt selection as a prompt curriculum design problem: constructing a
well ordered set of training examples that align with the model's current
capabilities. Our approach integrates two complementary signals: (1)
model-perceived difficulty, quantified through prediction disagreement in an
active learning setup, capturing what the model itself finds challenging; and
(2) intrinsic sample complexity, which measures the inherent difficulty of each
question-image pair independently of any model. By jointly analyzing these
signals, we develop a difficulty-balanced sampling strategy that ensures the
selected prompt examples are diverse across both dimensions. Extensive
experiments conducted on five challenging benchmarks and multiple popular
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate that our method yields
substantial and consistent improvements and greatly reduces performance
discrepancies caused by random sampling, providing a principled and robust
approach for enhancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的语言模型依赖统计性的下一个词预测，无法真正理解语义。作者希望开发一种能够主动塑造语言意义而非仅仅预测的认知架构。

Method: 使用复数运算和虚数单位i构建旋转语义结构，通过递归张量变换、梯度流和张量变形来形成语义吸引子，作为指导意义向稳定性和清晰度发展的目的性算子。

Result: 提出了一个数学上具有启发性、哲学上意义重大的语义转换模型，能够有效建模反讽、同音异义和歧义等复杂语义现象。

Conclusion: 真正的意义不是通过模拟产生，而是通过向语义一致性的递归收敛而涌现，这需要一种全新的认知架构设计来主动塑造语言。

Abstract: This essay develops a theoretical framework for a semantic Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI) based on the notion of semantic attractors in complex-valued
meaning spaces. Departing from current transformer-based language models, which
operate on statistical next-token prediction, we explore a model in which
meaning is not inferred probabilistically but formed through recursive
tensorial transformation. Using cyclic operations involving the imaginary unit
\emph{i}, we describe a rotational semantic structure capable of modeling
irony, homonymy, and ambiguity. At the center of this model, however, is a
semantic attractor -- a teleological operator that, unlike statistical
computation, acts as an intentional agent (Microvitum), guiding meaning toward
stability, clarity, and expressive depth. Conceived in terms of gradient flows,
tensor deformations, and iterative matrix dynamics, the attractor offers a
model of semantic transformation that is not only mathematically suggestive,
but also philosophically significant. We argue that true meaning emerges not
from simulation, but from recursive convergence toward semantic coherence, and
that this requires a fundamentally new kind of cognitive architecture -- one
designed to shape language, not just predict it.

TL;DR: KAIROS是一个模拟问答竞赛的多智能体基准测试，用于研究LLM如何基于历史印象建立信任、抵抗错误信息并整合同伴输入，发现GRPO方法在性能提升的同时降低了社交影响的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注从众偏差，但需要更全面地分析LLM在多智能体系统中如何形成信任、抵抗错误信息以及整合同伴输入，这些因素对实现复杂社交动态下的集体智能至关重要。

Method: 开发KAIROS基准测试，模拟不同可靠性同伴的问答竞赛，控制专家-新手角色、噪声群体和对抗性同伴等条件。评估提示工程、监督微调和强化学习（特别是GRPO）等多种缓解策略。

Result: GRPO结合多智能体上下文、基于结果的奖励和无约束推理实现了最佳整体性能，但与基础模型相比降低了对社交影响的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在多智能体环境中的信任形成和决策机制，GRPO方法在提升性能的同时需要关注其对社交影响鲁棒性的影响，为构建更可靠的集体智能系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent systems
(MAS) as components of collaborative intelligence, where peer interactions
dynamically shape individual decision-making. Although prior work has focused
on conformity bias, we extend the analysis to examine how LLMs form trust from
previous impressions, resist misinformation, and integrate peer input during
interaction, key factors for achieving collective intelligence under complex
social dynamics. We present KAIROS, a benchmark simulating quiz contests with
peer agents of varying reliability, offering fine-grained control over
conditions such as expert-novice roles, noisy crowds, and adversarial peers.
LLMs receive both historical interactions and current peer responses, allowing
systematic investigation into how trust, peer action, and self-confidence
influence decisions. As for mitigation strategies, we evaluate prompting,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), across multiple models. Our results reveal that GRPO with
multi-agent context combined with outcome-based rewards and unconstrained
reasoning achieves the best overall performance, but also decreases the
robustness to social influence compared to Base models. The code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/declare-lab/KAIROS.

Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the
world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is
nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with
regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This
multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual
impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack
robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English
text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts.
Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of
comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we
introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites
across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this
dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and
uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints
often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the
effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally
propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to
account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.

TL;DR: PLAST是一种通过精确语言特定层微调来高效增强大型视觉语言模型多语言能力的训练方法，仅需微调14%的参数即可显著提升多语言性能


<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多语言能力方面存在不平衡，研究发现多语言理解能力与浅层语言特定神经元激活存在显著相关性

Method: 首先通过监控语言特定神经元激活来识别参与多语言理解的层，然后使用问题翻译对精确微调这些层以实现多语言对齐

Result: 在MM-Bench和MMMB基准测试中有效提升了多语言能力，仅微调14%的参数就实现了显著效率

Conclusion: PLAST可推广到低资源和复杂视觉推理任务，促进浅层语言特定视觉信息参与，为多语言视觉语言模型提供高效训练方案

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
capabilities in understanding visual information with human languages but also
exhibit an imbalance in multilingual capabilities. In this work, we delve into
the multilingual working pattern of LVLMs and identify a salient correlation
between the multilingual understanding ability of LVLMs and language-specific
neuron activations in shallow layers. Building on this insight, we introduce
PLAST, a training recipe that achieves efficient multilingual enhancement for
LVLMs by Precise LAnguage-Specific layers fine-Tuning. PLAST first identifies
layers involved in multilingual understanding by monitoring language-specific
neuron activations. These layers are then precisely fine-tuned with
question-translation pairs to achieve multilingual alignment. Our empirical
results on MM-Bench and MMMB demonstrate that PLAST effectively improves the
multilingual capabilities of LVLMs and achieves significant efficiency with
only 14% of the parameters tuned. Further analysis reveals that PLAST can be
generalized to low-resource and complex visual reasoning tasks, facilitating
the language-specific visual information engagement in shallow layers.

TL;DR: 提出了Emotion Omni模型架构，能够在有限数据下理解用户语音情感并生成共情语音响应，无需大规模训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型缺乏对用户查询中丰富情感和副语言线索的深入理解，且训练共情能力需要大量数据和计算资源

Method: 提出新颖的Emotion Omni模型架构，并基于开源TTS框架开发数据生成流程，构建了20万条情感对话数据集

Result: 成功构建了支持共情语音助手的数据集和模型架构，实现了在有限数据条件下的情感理解和共情响应生成

Conclusion: Emotion Omni为解决语音LLM在有限数据下实现情感理解和共情响应生成提供了有效方案，提升了人机交互体验

Abstract: With the development of speech large language models (speech LLMs), users can
now interact directly with assistants via speech. However, most existing models
simply convert the response content into speech without fully understanding the
rich emotional and paralinguistic cues embedded in the user's query. In many
cases, the same sentence can have different meanings depending on the emotional
expression. Furthermore, emotional understanding is essential for improving
user experience in human-machine interaction. Currently, most speech LLMs with
empathetic capabilities are trained on massive datasets. This approach requires
vast amounts of data and significant computational resources. Therefore, a key
challenge lies in how to develop a speech LLM capable of generating empathetic
responses with limited data and without the need for large-scale training. To
address this challenge, we propose Emotion Omni, a novel model architecture
designed to understand the emotional content of user speech input and generate
empathetic speech responses. Additionally, we developed a data generation
pipeline based on an open-source TTS framework to construct a 200k emotional
dialogue dataset, which supports the construction of an empathetic speech
assistant. The demos are available at https://w311411.github.io/omni_demo/

Motivation: 企业环境中大语言模型的普及带来了风险，而发展稳健的监测器面临生产质量标注数据获取困难的挑战

Method: 提出backprompting方法生成生产级别标注数据，结合稀疏人巡环聚类技术进行标注，构建与原始数据集并行但类似真实LLM输出的语料库

Result: 在健康建议识别这个难题上，该方法的监测器性能超过GPT-4o达到3.73%，而参数数量仅为其的1/400

Conclusion: backprompting方法能够有效生成高质量标注数据，为开发稳健的LLM拦截器提供了可靠的数据支撑

Abstract: The pervasiveness of large language models (LLMs) in enterprise settings has
also brought forth a significant amount of risks associated with their usage.
Guardrails technologies aim to mitigate this risk by filtering LLMs'
input/output text through various detectors. However, developing and
maintaining robust detectors faces many challenges, one of which is the
difficulty in acquiring production-quality labeled data on real LLM outputs
prior to deployment. In this work, we propose backprompting, a simple yet
intuitive solution to generate production-like labeled data for health advice
guardrails development. Furthermore, we pair our backprompting method with a
sparse human-in-the-loop clustering technique to label the generated data. Our
aim is to construct a parallel corpus roughly representative of the original
dataset yet resembling real LLM output. We then infuse existing datasets with
our synthetic examples to produce robust training data for our detector. We
test our technique in one of the most difficult and nuanced guardrails: the
identification of health advice in LLM output, and demonstrate improvement
versus other solutions. Our detector is able to outperform GPT-4o by up to
3.73%, despite having 400x less parameters.

TL;DR: Integral Transformer通过从logit分布中采样信号来整合注意力，有效去噪并保留特殊标记的关键信息，在知识推理基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax自注意力经常给语义无关的标记（如特殊标记和标点）分配过多权重，产生注意力噪声。现有方法虽然引入负注意力分数但可能丢失有用信息。

Method: 提出Integral Transformer，一种新颖的自注意力机制，通过从logit分布中采样信号进行积分来去噪注意力，同时保留对模型性能至关重要的特殊标记贡献。

Result: 在成熟的知识和推理语言基准测试中，该模型优于原始、Cog和Differential注意力变体。分析显示在底层使用原始自注意力可提升性能，Integral Transformer能有效平衡注意力分布并减少上层秩塌陷。

Conclusion: Integral Transformer成功解决了注意力噪声问题，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更好的注意力分布平衡。

Abstract: Softmax self-attention often assigns disproportionate weight to semantically
uninformative tokens such as special tokens and punctuation, a phenomenon known
as attention noise. While recent methods like Cog Attention and the
Differential Transformer have addressed this by introducing negative attention
scores, they risk discarding useful information. In this paper, we propose the
Integral Transformer, a novel self-attention mechanism that denoises attention
by integrating signals sampled from the logit distribution. Our approach
mitigates noise while preserving the contributions of special tokens critical
for model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
outperforms vanilla, Cog, and Differential attention variants on
well-established knowledge and reasoning language benchmarks. Moreover, our
analysis reveals that employing vanilla self-attention in the lower Transformer
layers enhances performance and that the Integral Transformer effectively
balances attention distributions and reduces rank collapse in upper layers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Latent Self-Consistency (LSC) 是一种新的概率解码方法，通过可学习的词嵌入选择语义最一致的回答，在短形式和长形式推理任务上均优于现有方法，且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂或长形式问题上经常产生不一致的输出。现有的Self-Consistency方法在短形式QA上有效但在长形式上表现不佳，需要一种能在各种答案格式下都可靠的一致性选择方法。

Method: LSC使用可学习的词嵌入来选择语义最一致的回答，通过轻量级的前向生成摘要标记，推理时间仅增加不到1%，且无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在6个短形式和5个长形式推理基准测试中，LSC在所有短形式和长形式任务上平均超越了SC、USC和WUCS方法，同时保持可忽略的计算开销。

Conclusion: LSC是一种实用的跨答案格式一致性选择方法，能提供良好校准的置信度估计，在短形式和长形式任务上都保持低期望校准误差。

Abstract: Probabilistic decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
inconsistent outputs, particularly on complex or long-form questions.
Self-Consistency (SC) mitigates this for short-form QA by majority voting over
exact strings, whereas Universal Self-Consistency (USC) and Weighted Unigram
Consistency Score (WUCS) extend to long-form responses but lose accuracy on
short-form benchmarks.
  We introduce Latent Self-Consistency (LSC), which selects the most
semantically consistent response using learnable token embeddings. A
lightweight forward generation of summary tokens increases inference time by
less than 1% and requires no changes to the model architecture.
  Across 6 short-form and 5 long-form reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MATH, MMLU,
TruthfulQA), LSC surpasses SC, USC and WUCS on all short-form and long-form
ones on average, while maintaining negligible computational overhead. These
results position LSC as a practical consistency-selection method that works
reliably across answer formats. Additionally, LSC provides well-calibrated
confidence estimates, maintaining low Expected Calibration Error across both
answer formats.

Motivation: 现有的语音合成模型在处理长序列多说话人对话时面临计算效率和音频保真度的挑战，需要一种能够高效处理长语音同时保持音质的解决方案。

Method: 采用next-token diffusion方法，通过自回归生成潜在向量来建模连续数据；引入新型连续语音分词器，相比Encodec模型实现80倍数据压缩；支持64K上下文窗口长度。

Result: 能够合成长达90分钟的多说话人语音（最多4个说话人），在音频保真度和计算效率方面表现优异，超越了开源和专有对话模型。

Conclusion: VibeVoice通过创新的分词器和扩散方法，成功解决了长语音合成的技术难题，为多说话人对话合成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前AI研究中普遍采用的OOD评估假设，认为这种评估方式可能无法真实反映模型在现实部署中的失败模式，特别是对于依赖伪特征或预测捷径的问题。

Method: 通过将OOD评估结果与现有QA模型中记录的具体失败模式进行对比分析，研究不同OOD数据集在评估模型对预测捷径鲁棒性方面的质量差异。

Result: 发现不同OOD数据集提供的模型鲁棒性估计质量差异显著，有些数据集的表现甚至不如简单的in-distribution评估。部分原因是伪捷径在ID和OOD数据集间共享，且数据集训练质量和评估质量存在脱节。

Conclusion: 常用OOD泛化评估方法存在局限性，需要开发更稳健的评估方法来准确评估模型在QA及其他领域的泛化能力。

Abstract: A majority of recent work in AI assesses models' generalization capabilities
through the lens of performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Despite
their practicality, such evaluations build upon a strong assumption: that OOD
evaluations can capture and reflect upon possible failures in a real-world
deployment.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption and confront the results obtained
from OOD evaluations with a set of specific failure modes documented in
existing question-answering (QA) models, referred to as a reliance on spurious
features or prediction shortcuts.
  We find that different datasets used for OOD evaluations in QA provide an
estimate of models' robustness to shortcuts that have a vastly different
quality, some largely under-performing even a simple, in-distribution
evaluation. We partially attribute this to the observation that spurious
shortcuts are shared across ID+OOD datasets, but also find cases where a
dataset's quality for training and evaluation is largely disconnected. Our work
underlines limitations of commonly-used OOD-based evaluations of
generalization, and provides methodology and recommendations for evaluating
generalization within and beyond QA more robustly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM语义理解能力提升，其透明度下降且在新系统中缺乏足够排名数据时准确重排序面临挑战。不同训练方法对可解释性影响不同，需要深入理解LLM内部工作机制。

Method: 使用环境与地球科学领域的相对较小排名数据集进行内容重排序，分析不同训练方法对语义理解的影响，并检查可解释信息是否能为重排序提供推理依据。

Result: 研究发现某些训练方法比其他方法表现出更好的可解释性，表明并非所有训练方法都能学习到准确的语义理解，而是获得了抽象知识来优化评估。

Conclusion: 需要深入分析LLM内部工作机制来理解重排序背后的推理过程，不同训练方法对语义理解和可解释性有显著影响，这对LLM的真正可靠性提出了疑问。

Abstract: With the improving semantic understanding capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they exhibit a greater awareness and alignment with human values, but
this comes at the cost of transparency. Although promising results are achieved
via experimental analysis, an in-depth understanding of the LLM's internal
workings is unavoidable to comprehend the reasoning behind the re-ranking,
which provides end users with an explanation that enables them to make an
informed decision. Moreover, in newly developed systems with limited user
engagement and insufficient ranking data, accurately re-ranking content remains
a significant challenge. While various training methods affect the training of
LLMs and generate inference, our analysis has found that some training methods
exhibit better explainability than others, implying that an accurate semantic
understanding has not been learned through all training methods; instead,
abstract knowledge has been gained to optimize evaluation, which raises
questions about the true reliability of LLMs. Therefore, in this work, we
analyze how different training methods affect the semantic understanding of the
re-ranking task in LLMs and investigate whether these models can generate more
informed textual reasoning to overcome the challenges of transparency or LLMs
and limited training data. To analyze the LLMs for re-ranking tasks, we utilize
a relatively small ranking dataset from the environment and the Earth science
domain to re-rank retrieved content. Furthermore, we also analyze the
explainable information to see if the re-ranking can be reasoned using
explainability.

Method: 使用IPIS数据集（包含性别包容性校对和英译指导）微调Llama-8B、Mistral-7B、Mistral-Nemo等多语言模型以及Bielik、PLLuM等波兰语言模型，设计明确的性别包容性提示

Result: 将性别包容性集成为模型的内在特征，提供了减缓波兰语言生成中性别偏见的系统性解决方案

Conclusion: 通过语言学理论基础和人工编写的性别包容指导，可以有效减少LLM在波兰语中的性别偏见，为其他语言的类似问题提供参考

Abstract: Imagine a language with masculine, feminine, and neuter grammatical genders,
yet, due to historical and political conventions, masculine forms are
predominantly used to refer to men, women and mixed-gender groups. This is the
reality of contemporary Polish. A social consequence of this unfair linguistic
system is that large language models (LLMs) trained on Polish texts inherit and
reinforce this masculine bias, generating gender-imbalanced outputs. This study
addresses this issue by tuning LLMs using the IPIS dataset, a collection of
human-crafted gender-inclusive proofreading in Polish and Polish-to-English
translation instructions. Grounded in a theoretical linguistic framework, we
design a system prompt with explicit gender-inclusive guidelines for Polish. In
our experiments, we IPIS-tune multilingual LLMs (Llama-8B, Mistral-7B and
Mistral-Nemo) and Polish-specific LLMs (Bielik and PLLuM). Our approach aims to
integrate gender inclusivity as an inherent feature of these models, offering a
systematic solution to mitigate gender bias in Polish language generation.

Conclusion: 提出的多重检验启发的幻觉检测方法能够有效识别LLM生成的幻觉内容，为解决LLM可靠性问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful foundational
models to solve a variety of tasks, they have also been shown to be prone to
hallucinations, i.e., generating responses that sound confident but are
actually incorrect or even nonsensical. In this work, we formulate the problem
of detecting hallucinations as a hypothesis testing problem and draw parallels
to the problem of out-of-distribution detection in machine learning models. We
propose a multiple-testing-inspired method to solve the hallucination detection
problem, and provide extensive experimental results to validate the robustness
of our approach against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种新的机器翻译评价指标COMET-polycand和COMET-polyic，通过综合多个翻译版本或相似示例来提高评估准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译评估指标通常只考虑单个翻译结果，而人类评估者常在多个翻译版本的上下文中进行判断，这种差异影响了自动化指标的性能。

Method: COMET-polycand使用同一源句子的多个翻译版本进行对比分析；COMET-polyic受到检索基于上下文学习的启发，通过综合相似源文本的翻译和人工评分来指导评估。

Result: 在组合中添加一个额外翻译版本后，COMET-polycand在段落级判别中将Kendall's tau-b相关系数从0.079提高到0.118，使用更多翻译版本还能进一步提升。COMET-polyic通过检索示例也实现了类似的收益（0.079到0.116）。

Conclusion: 通过综合多个翻译版本或相似示例的信息，可以显著提高机器翻译评估指标的性能，更好地模仿人类评估者的判断方式。

Abstract: Automated metrics for machine translation attempt to replicate human
judgment. Unlike humans, who often assess a translation in the context of
multiple alternatives, these metrics typically consider only the source
sentence and a single translation. This discrepancy in the evaluation setup may
negatively impact the performance of automated metrics. We propose two
automated metrics that incorporate additional information beyond the single
translation. COMET-polycand uses alternative translations of the same source
sentence to compare and contrast with the translation at hand, thereby
providing a more informed assessment of its quality. COMET-polyic, inspired by
retrieval-based in-context learning, takes in translations of similar source
texts along with their human-labeled quality scores to guide the evaluation. We
find that including a single additional translation in COMET-polycand improves
the segment-level metric performance (0.079 to 0.118 Kendall's tau-b
correlation), with further gains when more translations are added.
Incorporating retrieved examples in COMET-polyic yields similar improvements
(0.079 to 0.116 Kendall's tau-b correlation). We release our models publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉隐喻生成需要同时满足语言理解和视觉一致性，当前方法在隐喻对齐方面遇到挑战。需要一种能够自我评估并改善隐喻意义保持的方法。

Method: 提出了包含新指标（隐喻分解分数和意义对齐指标）的自我评估方法。两种新方法：1）无训练流程：显式将提示分解为源-目标-意义（S-T-M）映射进行图像合成；2）训练基流程：使用自我评估奖励机制改善对齐，无需大规模重新训练。

Result: 在测试集上，无训练方法在分解、CLIP和意义对齐指标上超过了GPT-4o和Imagen等强基线模型。用户研究显示用户更偏好GPT-4o，但无训练流程在开源方法中领先，并在抽象隐喻上略胜Imagen。S-T-M提示对长或抽象隐喻更有效。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和轻量级强化学习在较低算力需求下能够有效实现隐喻对齐。与人类偏好的差距主要来自美学质量和采样过程的敏感性问题。

Abstract: Visual metaphor generation is a challenging task that aims to generate an
image given an input text metaphor. Inherently, it needs language understanding
to bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning
while ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor
generation framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation
approach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor
decomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we
explore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly
decomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image
synthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment
using our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale
retraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses
strong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,
with the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output
using a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o
overall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged
Imagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or
more abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;
we also observe sensitivity to sampler settings. Overall, structured prompting
and lightweight RL perform metaphor alignment well under modest compute, and
remaining gaps to human preference appear driven by aesthetics and sampling.

Conclusion: 语言不仅仅是内部状态的表达，更是一种能够根据语境生成新语言的话语机器，LLM通过不同途径也学会了这种技能

Abstract: What do large language models actually model? Do they tell us something about
human capacities, or are they models of the corpus we've trained them on? I
give a non-deflationary defence of the latter position. Cognitive science tells
us that linguistic capabilities in humans rely supralinear formats for
computation. The transformer architecture, by contrast, supports at best a
linear formats for processing. This argument will rely primarily on certain
invariants of the computational architecture of transformers. I then suggest a
positive story about what transformers are doing, focusing on Liu et al.
(2022)'s intriguing speculations about shortcut automata. I conclude with why I
don't think this is a terribly deflationary story. Language is not (just) a
means for expressing inner state but also a kind of 'discourse machine' that
lets us make new language given appropriate context. We have learned to use
this technology in one way; LLMs have also learned to use it too, but via very
different means.

Abstract: Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish
is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a
parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained. To address
such challenges, we propose \textbf{NOOV} (for No OOV), a new neural machine
translation (NMT) system that requires little in-domain parallel-aligned corpus
for training. NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from
parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large
biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and
the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT
systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of
EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然后训练量化(PTQ)是大语言模型部署的实用压缩方案，但对其如何精确影响各种LLM知识能力的理解仍不充分，现有的量化模型缩放律常忽略PTQ特定参数和任务特定敏感性。

Method: 进行广泛的实证研究，将LLM知识解构为记忆能力和利用能力，开发包含模型大小、有效位宽、校准集大小和分组大小的统一量化框架。

Result: 核心发现知识记忆能力对有效位宽、校准集大小和模型大小的变化显示出显著更高的敏感性，而知识利用能力则更加稳健。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了对PTQ影响的细粒度理解，为开发能更好保留目标认知功能的知识感知量化策略提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their scale, with post-training quantization (PTQ) emerging as a practical
compression solution. However, a comprehensive understanding of how PTQ
precisely impacts diverse LLM knowledge capabilities remains elusive, and
existing scaling laws for quantized models often overlook crucial PTQ-specific
parameters and task-specific sensitivities. This paper addresses these gaps by
conducting an extensive empirical investigation to establish task-stratified
scaling laws. We disentangle LLM knowledge into memorization and utilization
capabilities and develop a unified quantitative framework that incorporates
model size, effective bit-width, calibration set size, and group size. Our
central finding reveals that knowledge memorization exhibits markedly greater
sensitivity to variations in effective bit-width, calibration set size, and
model size compared to the more robust knowledge utilization. These findings
offer a fine-grained understanding of PTQ's impact and provide guidance for
developing knowledge-aware quantization strategies that can better preserve
targeted cognitive functions.

TL;DR: TBYS框架通过在推理步骤之间插入主动生成的insights来指导LLMs的复杂推理过程，提高数学问题解决能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务（如数学）上表现不佳，因为训练数据中缺乏人类思考过程中的关键insights和中间推理步骤

Method: 提出Thinking Before You Speak (TBYS)框架，自动生成insights来连接推理步骤，设计pipeline自动收集和过滤in-context示例

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学数据集上验证了TBYS的有效性

Conclusion: 通过主动生成insights来指导推理过程，可以有效提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，且减少了人工标注和微调的开销

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit deficiencies with complex
reasoning tasks, such as maths, which we attribute to the discrepancy between
human reasoning patterns and those presented in the LLMs' training data. When
dealing with complex problems, humans tend to think carefully before expressing
solutions. However, they often do not articulate their inner thoughts,
including their intentions and chosen methodologies. Consequently, critical
insights essential for bridging reasoning steps may be absent in training data
collected from human sources. To bridge this gap, we proposes inserting
\emph{insight}s between consecutive reasoning steps, which review the status
and initiate the next reasoning steps. Unlike prior prompting strategies that
rely on a single or a workflow of static prompts to facilitate reasoning,
\emph{insight}s are \emph{proactively} generated to guide reasoning processes.
We implement our idea as a reasoning framework, named \emph{Thinking Before You
Speak} (TBYS), and design a pipeline for automatically collecting and filtering
in-context examples for the generation of \emph{insight}s, which alleviates
human labeling efforts and fine-tuning overheads. Experiments on challenging
mathematical datasets verify the effectiveness of TBYS. Project website:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过动态整合外部知识和模型内部参数的输出概率，CoDe框架成功突破了大语言模型在忠实性和表达性之间的交换作用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在整合外部知识时无法同时保持忠实性和表达性的问题，以减少幻觉现象

Method: 提出协同解码(CoDe)方法，通过分布散度和模型信心引导动态整合有无外部知识的输出概率，并采用知识感知重排度机制

Result: 在多种大语言模型和评估指标上，CoDe框架在不損害表达性的前提下显著提升了忠实性，验证了其有效性和通用性

Conclusion: CoDe作为一种即插即用的框架，成功解决了大语言模型在知识基础回答中忠实性与表达性的两难问题

Abstract: Grounding responses in external knowledge represents an effective strategy
for mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
LLMs struggle to seamlessly integrate knowledge while simultaneously
maintaining faithfulness (or fidelity) and expressiveness, capabilities that
humans naturally possess. This limitation results in outputs that either lack
support from external knowledge, thereby compromising faithfulness, or appear
overly verbose and unnatural, thus sacrificing expressiveness. In this work, to
break the trade-off between faithfulness and expressiveness, we propose
Collaborative Decoding (CoDe), a novel approach that dynamically integrates
output probabilities generated with and without external knowledge. This
integration is guided by distribution divergence and model confidence, enabling
the selective activation of relevant and reliable expressions from the model's
internal parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge-aware reranking
mechanism that prevents over-reliance on prior parametric knowledge while
ensuring proper utilization of provided external information. Through
comprehensive experiments, our plug-and-play CoDe framework demonstrates
superior performance in enhancing faithfulness without compromising
expressiveness across diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics, validating both its
effectiveness and generalizability.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了医疗视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中存在回答不一致性问题，构建了RoMed数据集进行评测，并提出了CCL方法显著提升了模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险医疗应用中，模型需要对语义相同但表述不同的医学问题给出一致回答，但现有Med-VLMs在面对问题重述时表现出严重的脆弱性。

Method: 构建包含14.4万个问题的RoMed数据集，提出一致性对比学习(CCL)方法，包括知识锚定一致性学习和偏差感知对比学习两个核心组件。

Result: 在RoMed测试集上，SOTA模型性能显著下降(如召回率下降40%)，而CCL方法在三个流行VQA基准上达到SOTA性能，并将答案一致性提升了50%。

Conclusion: CCL方法通过知识对齐和偏差缓解，显著增强了医疗视觉语言模型的鲁棒性和回答一致性，为可靠医疗诊断提供了重要保障。

Abstract: In high-stakes medical applications, consistent answering across diverse
question phrasings is essential for reliable diagnosis. However, we reveal that
current Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) exhibit concerning fragility
in Medical Visual Question Answering, as their answers fluctuate significantly
when faced with semantically equivalent rephrasings of medical questions. We
attribute this to two limitations: (1) insufficient alignment of medical
concepts, leading to divergent reasoning patterns, and (2) hidden biases in
training data that prioritize syntactic shortcuts over semantic understanding.
To address these challenges, we construct RoMed, a dataset built upon original
VQA datasets containing 144k questions with variations spanning word-level,
sentence-level, and semantic-level perturbations. When evaluating
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like LLaVA-Med on RoMed, we observe alarming
performance drops (e.g., a 40\% decline in Recall) compared to original VQA
benchmarks, exposing critical robustness gaps. To bridge this gap, we propose
Consistency and Contrastive Learning (CCL), which integrates two key
components: (1) knowledge-anchored consistency learning, aligning Med-VLMs with
medical knowledge rather than shallow feature patterns, and (2) bias-aware
contrastive learning, mitigating data-specific priors through discriminative
representation refinement. CCL achieves SOTA performance on three popular VQA
benchmarks and notably improves answer consistency by 50\% on the challenging
RoMed test set, demonstrating significantly enhanced robustness. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: 提出了Attention2Probability方法，通过注意力权重转换和课程学习来提升语音大模型中专业术语的识别准确率，在中文和英文上分别达到92.57%和86.83%的召回率，延迟仅8.71ms。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大模型在通用领域表现良好，但在处理领域特定术语和新词时准确率不足，需要专门的方法来提升术语识别能力。

Method: 提出Attention2Probability方法，将语音与术语间的交叉注意力权重转换为存在概率，并采用课程学习提高检索准确性。同时构建了包含术语的语音数据集。

Result: 在测试集上显著优于VectorDB方法，中文最大召回率92.57%，英文86.83%，查询延迟仅8.71ms。术语干预使SLM的术语准确率提升6-17%。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量、灵活且准确，有效解决了语音大模型处理专业术语的挑战，同时揭示了当前SLM在术语利用方面仍存在局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (SLMs) have improved speech
recognition and translation in general domains, but accurately generating
domain-specific terms or neologisms remains challenging. To address this, we
propose Attention2Probability: attention-driven terminology probability
estimation for robust speech-to-text system, which is lightweight, flexible,
and accurate. Attention2Probability converts cross-attention weights between
speech and terminology into presence probabilities, and it further employs
curriculum learning to enhance retrieval accuracy. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of data for speech-to-text tasks with terminology intervention, we create
and release a new speech dataset with terminology to support future research in
this area. Experimental results show that Attention2Probability significantly
outperforms the VectorDB method on our test set. Specifically, its maximum
recall rates reach 92.57% for Chinese and 86.83% for English. This high recall
is achieved with a latency of only 8.71ms per query. Intervening in SLMs'
recognition and translation tasks using Attention2Probability-retrieved terms
improves terminology accuracy by 6-17%, while revealing that the current
utilization of terminology by SLMs has limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了自适应原创性过滤(AOF)提示框架，通过余弦相似度拒绝冗余生成，在保持跨语言保真度的同时提升多语言谜语生成的原创性和词汇多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言谜语生成需要平衡文化流畅性和创造性抽象，但标准提示策略往往重复记忆的谜语或进行浅层改写，缺乏真正的创造性。

Method: 提出AOF框架，使用基于余弦相似度的拒绝机制过滤冗余生成，同时强制词汇新颖性和跨语言保真度，无需任务特定的微调。

Result: 在三个LLM和四个语言对上的评估显示，AOF增强的GPT-4o在日语上达到0.177 Self-BLEU和0.915 Distinct-2，表明词汇多样性显著提升且冗余减少。

Conclusion: 语义拒绝机制可以有效引导文化基础扎实的创造性生成，为多语言创意文本生成提供了无需微调的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual riddle generation challenges large language models (LLMs) to
balance cultural fluency with creative abstraction. Standard prompting
strategies -- zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought -- tend to reuse memorized
riddles or perform shallow paraphrasing. We introduce Adaptive Originality
Filtering (AOF), a prompting framework that filters redundant generations using
cosine-based similarity rejection, while enforcing lexical novelty and
cross-lingual fidelity. Evaluated across three LLMs and four language pairs,
AOF-enhanced GPT-4o achieves \texttt{0.177} Self-BLEU and \texttt{0.915}
Distinct-2 in Japanese, signaling improved lexical diversity and reduced
redundancy compared to other prompting methods and language pairs. Our findings
show that semantic rejection can guide culturally grounded, creative generation
without task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在客户服务中的快速应用带来了新的风险，恶意行为者可能利用机器生成文本来进行大规模用户冒充。现有检测方法在在线对话环境中表现不佳，缺乏可靠性和可解释性，而客户服务场景中的操作员通常是非专家用户，需要可理解的解释来建立信任。

Method: 提出了EMMM（Explanation-then-Detection）框架，采用先解释后检测的方法，为非专家用户提供可理解的解释，同时保持低延迟和高准确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，EMMM能为非专家用户提供可访问的解释，70%的人类评估者偏好其输出，在保持与最先进模型竞争性准确度的同时，延迟低于1秒。

Conclusion: EMMM框架成功解决了客户服务场景中机器生成文本检测的可解释性问题，为非专家用户提供了可信赖的AI检测方案，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in customer service
introduces new risks, as malicious actors can exploit them to conduct
large-scale user impersonation through machine-generated text (MGT). Current
MGT detection methods often struggle in online conversational settings,
reducing the reliability and interpretability essential for trustworthy AI
deployment. In customer service scenarios where operators are typically
non-expert users, explanation become crucial for trustworthy MGT detection. In
this paper, we propose EMMM, an explanation-then-detection framework that
balances latency, accuracy, and non-expert-oriented interpretability.
Experimental results demonstrate that EMMM provides explanations accessible to
non-expert users, with 70\% of human evaluators preferring its outputs, while
achieving competitive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models and
maintaining low latency, generating outputs within 1 second. Our code and

Motivation: 当前广告标题生成方法主要优化质量或点击率，忽视了多样性需求，导致输出同质化严重，无法满足不同受众群体的需求。

Method: 设计语义和风格感知的数据生成管道自动产生高质量训练数据；采用多阶段多目标优化框架，结合监督微调和强化学习，在单次前向传播中生成高质量多样化标题。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上验证了DIVER能有效平衡质量和多样性；在大规模内容分享平台部署后，广告价值(ADVV)提升4.0%，点击率(CTR)提升1.4%。

Conclusion: DIVER框架成功解决了广告标题生成中质量与多样性的平衡问题，通过联合优化实现了更好的广告效果，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising,
where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of
audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for
headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for
diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we
propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are
jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic-
and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces
high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To
achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within
a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization
framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER
effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale
content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework
improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.

Motivation: 现有MECTEC任务面临数据集稀缺（只有一个高度统一的对话场景数据集）和现有方法未能显式建模情感因果上下文、忽视多层级语义信息融合的问题

Method: 提出M3HG模型，通过多模态异构图显式捕捉情感和因果上下文，并在utterance间和utterance内两个层级有效融合上下文信息

Result: 大量实验证明M3HG相比现有最先进方法具有更好的效果

Conclusion: M3HG模型和MECAD数据集有效解决了多模态对话中情感原因三元组抽取的挑战，为后续研究提供了重要基础

Abstract: Emotion Cause Triplet Extraction in Multimodal Conversations (MECTEC) has
recently gained significant attention in social media analysis, aiming to
extract emotion utterances, cause utterances, and emotion categories
simultaneously. However, the scarcity of related datasets, with only one
published dataset featuring highly uniform dialogue scenarios, hinders model
development in this field. To address this, we introduce MECAD, the first
multimodal, multi-scenario MECTEC dataset, comprising 989 conversations from 56
TV series spanning a wide range of dialogue contexts. In addition, existing
MECTEC methods fail to explicitly model emotional and causal contexts and
neglect the fusion of semantic information at different levels, leading to
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose M3HG, a novel model that
explicitly captures emotional and causal contexts and effectively fuses
contextual information at both inter- and intra-utterance levels via a
multimodal heterogeneous graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of M3HG compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. The
codes and dataset are available at https://github.com/redifinition/M3HG.

TL;DR: ChronoRAG是一个专门针对叙事文本的新型RAG框架，通过重构连贯段落和保持时间顺序来改进长上下文问答任务，在NarrativeQA数据集上取得了显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法在处理叙事文本时效果有限，因为叙事理解需要超越孤立段落，需要更广泛的上下文和段落间的序列关系。叙事问答中正确答案往往依赖于重建连贯的时间线和保持上下文流。

Method: 提出ChronoRAG框架，专注于两个关键方面：1) 将分散的文档信息精炼为连贯的结构化段落；2) 通过显式捕获和维护检索段落间的时间顺序来保持叙事流。

Result: 在NarrativeQA数据集上的实验证明，ChronoRAG在需要事实识别和复杂序列关系理解的任务中取得了实质性改进，表明时间顺序推理对于解决叙事问答至关重要。

Conclusion: 时间顺序推理在叙事问答中具有关键作用，ChronoRAG通过专门针对叙事文本特性的设计，有效提升了长上下文问答任务的性能。

Abstract: Long-context question answering over narrative tasks is challenging because
correct answers often hinge on reconstructing a coherent timeline of events
while preserving contextual flow in a limited context window.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) indexing methods aim to address this
challenge by selectively retrieving only necessary document segments. However,
narrative texts possess unique characteristics that limit the effectiveness of
these existing approaches. Specifically, understanding narrative texts requires
more than isolated segments, as the broader context and sequential
relationships between segments are crucial for comprehension. To address these
limitations, we propose ChronoRAG, a novel RAG framework specialized for
narrative texts. This approach focuses on two essential aspects: refining
dispersed document information into coherent and structured passages, and
preserving narrative flow by explicitly capturing and maintaining the temporal
order among retrieved passages. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
ChronoRAG through experiments on the NarrativeQA dataset, showing substantial
improvements in tasks requiring both factual identification and comprehension
of complex sequential relationships, underscoring that reasoning over temporal
order is crucial in resolving narrative QA.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备强大的思维链推理能力，但计算成本控制仍是实际部署的重大挑战。开源社区缺乏类似GPT-oss系列的可控推理能力，需要开发开放的可控推理框架。

Method: 采用端到端训练范式：预算模式监督微调将可控推理能力嵌入学习过程，以及两阶段预算感知强化学习与自适应奖励塑形。通过三种操作模式（高、中、低）实现不同级别的计算压缩。

Result: 实现了目标压缩-性能权衡：中模式减少50%token且性能下降<10%，低模式减少75%token且性能下降<15%。在分布外任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ThinkDial成功实现了开源可控推理框架，为实际部署提供了有效的计算成本控制解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算开销。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought reasoning have
demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities, but controlling their
computational effort remains a significant challenge for practical deployment.
Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced
discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source
community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we
introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that
successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete
operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct
reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50
percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode
(75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We
achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates
budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised
fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the
learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with
adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial
achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length
reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also
exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.

Motivation: 传统的直接生成正确句子的监督细调方法限制了大语言模型的强大推理能力，需要开发更控制可靠的方法

Method: 提出了一种基于规则强化学习（Rule-Based RL）的新框架，利用强化学习来导航大语言模型

Result: 在中文数据集上达到了state-of-the-art性能，可叐回率（recall）有显著提升

Conclusion: 强化学习方法能够更好地发挥大语言模型的推理能力，为语法错误编正领域提供了更可控制和可靠的发展范式

Abstract: Grammatical error correction is a significant task in NLP. Traditional
methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the
application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research
predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly
generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning
ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on
Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL
framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable
increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of
using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for
future development in GEC.

Abstract: Conversational analytics has been on the forefront of transformation driven
by the advances in Speech and Natural Language Processing techniques. Rapid
adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the analytics field has taken the
problems that can be automated to a new level of complexity and scale. In this
paper, we introduce Theme Detection as a critical task in conversational
analytics, aimed at automatically identifying and categorizing topics within
conversations. This process can significantly reduce the manual effort involved
in analyzing expansive dialogs, particularly in domains like customer support
or sales. Unlike traditional dialog intent detection, which often relies on a
fixed set of intents for downstream system logic, themes are intended as a
direct, user-facing summary of the conversation's core inquiry. This
distinction allows for greater flexibility in theme surface forms and
user-specific customizations. We pose Controllable Conversational Theme
Detection problem as a public competition track at Dialog System Technology
Challenge (DSTC) 12 -- it is framed as joint clustering and theme labeling of
dialog utterances, with the distinctive aspect being controllability of the
resulting theme clusters' granularity achieved via the provided user preference
data. We give an overview of the problem, the associated dataset and the
evaluation metrics, both automatic and human. Finally, we discuss the
participant teams' submissions and provide insights from those. The track
materials (data and code) are openly available in the GitHub repository.

Conclusion: LaTeXTrans为翻译LaTeX格式文档提供了一个有效且实用的解决方案，能够很好地保持格式完整性和语义准确性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of modern machine translation (MT) systems on
general-domain texts, translating structured LaTeX-formatted documents remains
a significant challenge. These documents typically interleave natural language
with domain-specific syntax, such as mathematical equations, tables, figures,
and cross-references, all of which must be accurately preserved to maintain
semantic integrity and compilability. In this paper, we introduce LaTeXTrans, a
collaborative multi-agent system designed to address this challenge. LaTeXTrans
ensures format preservation, structural fidelity, and terminology consistency
through six specialized agents: 1) a Parser that decomposes LaTeX into
translation-friendly units via placeholder substitution and syntax filtering;
2) a Translator, Validator, Summarizer, and Terminology Extractor that work
collaboratively to ensure context-aware, self-correcting, and
terminology-consistent translations; 3) a Generator that reconstructs the
translated content into well-structured LaTeX documents. Experimental results
demonstrate that LaTeXTrans can outperform mainstream MT systems in both
translation accuracy and structural fidelity, offering an effective and
practical solution for translating LaTeX-formatted documents.

Result: 广泛实验证明该自监督偏僵框架在限制标签数据集情况下仍能达到更优的性能，超越现有最先进方法，同时提升了模型的普适性

Conclusion: 该研究提出的结合语义表征和传播动态的自监督偏僵方法有效解决了失信检测中的关键挑战，为少量标签数据场景下的高效检测提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: The proliferation of misinformation in the digital age has led to significant
societal challenges. Existing approaches often struggle with capturing
long-range dependencies, complex semantic relations, and the social dynamics
influencing news dissemination. Furthermore, these methods require extensive
labelled datasets, making their deployment resource-intensive. In this study,
we propose a novel self-supervised misinformation detection framework that
integrates both complex semantic relations using Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) and news propagation dynamics. We introduce an LLM-based
graph contrastive loss (LGCL) that utilizes negative anchor points generated by
a Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance feature separability in a zero-shot
manner. To incorporate social context, we employ a multi view graph masked
autoencoder, which learns news propagation features from social context graph.
By combining these semantic and propagation-based features, our approach
effectively differentiates between fake and real news in a self-supervised
manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our self-supervised framework
achieves superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methodologies,
even with limited labelled datasets while improving generalizability.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning of large language models (LLMs) demands
high-quality training data, yet conventional methods face critical challenges
in scalability, cost, and data reliability. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel program-assisted synthesis framework that systematically
generates a high-quality mathematical corpus with guaranteed diversity,
complexity, and correctness. This framework integrates mathematical knowledge
systems and domain-specific tools to create executable programs. These programs
are then translated into natural language problem-solution pairs and vetted by
a bilateral validation mechanism that verifies solution correctness against
program outputs and ensures program-problem consistency. We have generated 12.3
million such problem-solving triples. Experiments demonstrate that models
fine-tuned on our data significantly improve their inference capabilities,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and
showcasing the effectiveness of our synthesis approach.

<details>

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在科学、法律、医疗等高风险领域部署时经常表现出过度自信的问题，生成错误答案却给出高置信度，现有校准方法效果有限且泛化性不足。

Method: 提出ConfTuner微调方法，使用理论证明为proper scoring rule的tokenized Brier score损失函数，无需真实置信度分数或代理置信度估计，通过最小化该损失来校准模型的置信度表达。

Result: ConfTuner在多种推理任务上显著改善了校准效果，并能泛化到GPT-4o等黑盒模型，更好的校准置信度带来了自校正和模型级联等下游任务的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发可信赖的LLM系统提供了有效工具，通过适当的评分规则实现了对模型置信度的有效校准，推动了LLM在关键领域的可靠应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains
such as science, law, and healthcare, where accurate expressions of uncertainty
are essential for reliability and trust. However, current LLMs are often
observed to generate incorrect answers with high confidence, a phenomenon known
as "overconfidence". Recent efforts have focused on calibrating LLMs'
verbalized confidence: i.e., their expressions of confidence in text form, such
as "I am 80% confident that...". Existing approaches either rely on prompt
engineering or fine-tuning with heuristically generated uncertainty estimates,
both of which have limited effectiveness and generalizability. Motivated by the
notion of proper scoring rules for calibration in classical machine learning
models, we introduce ConfTuner, a simple and efficient fine-tuning method that
introduces minimal overhead and does not require ground-truth confidence scores
or proxy confidence estimates. ConfTuner relies on a new loss function,
tokenized Brier score, which we theoretically prove to be a proper scoring
rule, intuitively meaning that it "correctly incentivizes the model to report
its true probability of being correct". ConfTuner improves calibration across
diverse reasoning tasks and generalizes to black-box models such as GPT-4o. Our
results further show that better-calibrated confidence enables downstream gains
in self-correction and model cascade, advancing the development of trustworthy
LLM systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: ReflectivePrompt成为进化算法自动提示领域最有效的解决方案之一，通过反射机制显著提升了提示优化的效果

Abstract: Autoprompting is the process of automatically selecting optimized prompts for
language models, which has been gaining popularity with the rapid advancement
of prompt engineering, driven by extensive research in the field of large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents ReflectivePrompt - a novel
autoprompting method based on evolutionary algorithms that employs a reflective
evolution approach for more precise and comprehensive search of optimal
prompts. ReflectivePrompt utilizes short-term and long-term reflection
operations before crossover and elitist mutation to enhance the quality of the
modifications they introduce. This method allows for the accumulation of
knowledge obtained throughout the evolution process and updates it at each
epoch based on the current population. ReflectivePrompt was tested on 33
datasets for classification and text generation tasks using open-access large
language models: t-lite-instruct-0.1 and gemma3-27b-it. The method
demonstrates, on average, a significant improvement (e.g., 28% on BBH compared
to EvoPrompt) in metrics relative to current state-of-the-art approaches,
thereby establishing itself as one of the most effective solutions in
evolutionary algorithm-based autoprompting.

Motivation: 计算教育研究(CER)中，研究者常常缺乏资源进行大规模、可推广的严谨研究，需要能够处理大量定性数据而不增加研究负担的方法。

Method: 提出LLM辅助内容分析(LACA)方法，结合内容分析和大型语言模型，使研究者能够进行原本无法完成的大规模研究。

Result: 通过计算教育数据集展示了LACA方法在可重复和严谨分析中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: LACA方法在CER领域具有重要潜力，能够从更广泛的研究中获得更可推广的发现，有助于提升CER学科的研究质量和实践水平。

Abstract: Computing education research (CER) is often instigated by practitioners
wanting to improve both their own and the wider discipline's teaching practice.
However, the latter is often difficult as many researchers lack the colleagues,
resources, or capacity to conduct research that is generalisable or rigorous
enough to advance the discipline. As a result, research methods that enable
sense-making with larger volumes of qualitative data, while not increasing the
burden on the researcher, have significant potential within CER.
  In this discussion paper, we propose such a method for conducting rigorous
analysis on large volumes of textual data, namely a variation of LLM-assisted
content analysis (LACA). This method combines content analysis with the use of
large language models, empowering researchers to conduct larger-scale research
which they would otherwise not be able to perform. Using a computing education
dataset, we illustrate how LACA could be applied in a reproducible and rigorous
manner. We believe this method has potential in CER, enabling more
generalisable findings from a wider range of research. This, together with the
development of similar methods, can help to advance both the practice and
research quality of the CER discipline.

Motivation: 研究情感极化（对反对群体的负面情绪和敌意）是否存在于欧洲议会中，以及其表现模式和机制

Method: 收集六国欧洲议会的演讲语料库，运用自然语言处理技术估计议员情感，通过比较对己方和对方群体提及时的负面情绪水平来分析情感极化模式

Result: 在所有六个欧洲议会中都发现了持续的情感极化现象；活动量与负面情绪相关，但活跃度不同的议员在情感极化方面没有差异；互惠机制是各国议会中情感极化的共同驱动因素

Conclusion: 情感极化是欧洲议会的普遍现象，互惠行为加剧了这种极化，表明需要关注政治话语中的负面情绪动态

Abstract: Affective polarization, characterized by increased negativity and hostility
towards opposing groups, has become a prominent feature of political discourse
worldwide. Our study examines the presence of this type of polarization in a
selection of European parliaments in a fully automated manner. Utilizing a
comprehensive corpus of parliamentary speeches from the parliaments of six
European countries, we employ natural language processing techniques to
estimate parliamentarian sentiment. By comparing the levels of negativity
conveyed in references to individuals from opposing groups versus one's own, we
discover patterns of affectively polarized interactions. The findings
demonstrate the existence of consistent affective polarization across all six
European parliaments. Although activity correlates with negativity, there is no
observed difference in affective polarization between less active and more
active members of parliament. Finally, we show that reciprocity is a
contributing mechanism in affective polarization between parliamentarians
across all six parliaments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索增强生成(RAG)系统的评估主要集中在性能指标上，而忽视了评估数据集的质量设计，特别是在语义多样性和隐私保护方面的需求。

Method: 提出一种多模态框架：(1)Diversity agent利用聚类技术实现主题覆盖和语义变量最大化；(2)Privacy Agent检测和隐藏多领域敏感信息；(3)QA curation agent合成具有隐私保护和多样性的QA对作为RAG评估的真实标签。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法生成的评估集在多样性方面超过基线方法，并在领域特定数据集上实现了稳健的隐私隐藏效果。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一条实用且符合道德标准的路径，实现更安全、更全面的RAG系统评估，为未来遵循涉及AI监管和合规标准的提升奠定了基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems improve large language model
outputs by incorporating external knowledge, enabling more informed and
context-aware responses. However, the effectiveness and trustworthiness of
these systems critically depends on how they are evaluated, particularly on
whether the evaluation process captures real-world constraints like protecting
sensitive information. While current evaluation efforts for RAG systems have
primarily focused on the development of performance metrics, far less attention
has been given to the design and quality of the underlying evaluation datasets,
despite their pivotal role in enabling meaningful, reliable assessments. In
this work, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework for generating synthetic
QA datasets for RAG evaluation that prioritize semantic diversity and privacy
preservation. Our approach involves: (1) a Diversity agent leveraging
clustering techniques to maximize topical coverage and semantic variability,
(2) a Privacy Agent that detects and mask sensitive information across multiple
domains and (3) a QA curation agent that synthesizes private and diverse QA
pairs suitable as ground truth for RAG evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our evaluation sets outperform baseline methods in diversity
and achieve robust privacy masking on domain-specific datasets. This work
offers a practical and ethically aligned pathway toward safer, more
comprehensive RAG system evaluation, laying the foundation for future
enhancements aligned with evolving AI regulations and compliance standards.

Motivation: 传统的事后解释方法存在局限性，需要将推理直接嵌入到模型表示中，实现真正的内在可解释性，同时支持符号推理和直觉判断的统一机制。

Method: 引入互补训练目标增强符号纯度和决策稀疏性，采用顺序专业化策略先建立广泛的符号能力再细化直觉判断，使用门控归纳机制指导选择性关注。

Result: 在AI任务实验中展现出竞争性准确度，同时提供可验证的推理轨迹，证明AI母语可以作为神经网络模型中可解释性、直觉和符号推理的统一机制。

Conclusion: AI母语框架成功地将符号推理和神经网络结合，实现了内在可解释性，为构建透明且强大的AI系统提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: We present a framework where neural models develop an AI Mother Tongue, a
native symbolic language that simultaneously supports intuitive reasoning,
compositional symbol chains, and inherent interpretability. Unlike post-hoc
explanation methods, our approach embeds reasoning directly into the model's
representations: symbols capture meaningful semantic patterns, chains trace
decision paths, and gated induction mechanisms guide selective focus, yielding
transparent yet flexible reasoning. We introduce complementary training
objectives to enhance symbol purity and decision sparsity, and employ a
sequential specialization strategy to first build broad symbolic competence and
then refine intuitive judgments. Experiments on AI tasks demonstrate
competitive accuracy alongside verifiable reasoning traces, showing that AI
Mother Tongue can serve as a unified mechanism for interpretability, intuition,
and symbolic reasoning in neural models.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA)
dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content.
Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE
emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to
the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach,
utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate
and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we
develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation
potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation
scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To
address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce
an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves
model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes
to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂长时程规划场景中缺乏宏观指导，容易迷失方向，且执行过程中缺乏持续监督，无法适应环境变化和纠正偏差

Method: 采用分层规划框架：离线阶段从专家演示构建里程碑库实现结构化经验复用；执行阶段动态适配轨迹片段生成步骤提示，将当前观察与里程碑目标对齐

Conclusion: HiPlan通过自适应全局-局部指导有效解决了LLM代理在复杂规划任务中的方向迷失和偏差问题，提升了决策性能

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in decision-making tasks, but struggle significantly with complex,
long-horizon planning scenarios. This arises from their lack of macroscopic
guidance, causing disorientation and failures in complex tasks, as well as
insufficient continuous oversight during execution, rendering them unresponsive
to environmental changes and prone to deviations. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce HiPlan, a hierarchical planning framework that provides adaptive
global-local guidance to boost LLM-based agents'decision-making. HiPlan
decomposes complex tasks into milestone action guides for general direction and
step-wise hints for detailed actions. During the offline phase, we construct a
milestone library from expert demonstrations, enabling structured experience
reuse by retrieving semantically similar tasks and milestones. In the execution
phase, trajectory segments from past milestones are dynamically adapted to
generate step-wise hints that align current observations with the milestone
objectives, bridging gaps and correcting deviations. Extensive experiments
across two challenging benchmarks demonstrate that HiPlan substantially
outperforms strong baselines, and ablation studies validate the complementary
benefits of its hierarchical components.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了首个医疗意图分类的大规模标注数据集，揭示了医疗对话的结构模式，为设计差分诊断系统提供了宝贵见解，并证明了意图过滤在医疗对话摘要中的有效性。

Abstract: In a doctor-patient dialogue, the primary objective of physicians is to
diagnose patients and propose a treatment plan. Medical doctors guide these
conversations through targeted questioning to efficiently gather the
information required to provide the best possible outcomes for patients. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies physician intent
trajectories in doctor-patient dialogues. We use the `Ambient Clinical
Intelligence Benchmark' (Aci-bench) dataset for our study. We collaborate with
medical professionals to develop a fine-grained taxonomy of physician intents
based on the SOAP framework (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan). We
then conduct a large-scale annotation effort to label over 5000 doctor-patient
turns with the help of a large number of medical experts recruited using
Prolific, a popular crowd-sourcing platform. This large labeled dataset is an
important resource contribution that we use for benchmarking the
state-of-the-art generative and encoder models for medical intent
classification tasks. Our findings show that our models understand the general
structure of medical dialogues with high accuracy, but often fail to identify
transitions between SOAP categories. We also report for the first time common
trajectories in medical dialogue structures that provide valuable insights for
designing `differential diagnosis' systems. Finally, we extensively study the
impact of intent filtering for medical dialogue summarization and observe a
significant boost in performance. We make the codes and data, including
annotation guidelines, publicly available at
https://github.com/DATEXIS/medical-intent-classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极低资源语言，特别是使用稀有文字的语言，在大型语言模型中缺乏支持，主要原因是训练数据匮乏。本文旨在分析LLMs是否能够通过上下文学习来掌握这些语言。

Method: 系统评估了20种代表性不足的语言，在三个最先进的多语言LLMs上测试了上下文学习（有/无辅助对齐信号）与参数高效微调方法的对比。

Result: 发现当语言及其文字在LLM中代表性极低时，PEFT存在局限性。零样本ICL配合语言对齐对极低资源语言效果显著，而少样本ICL或PEFT更适合相对资源较多的语言。

Conclusion: 为LLM从业者提供了基于结果的指导原则，例如避免在未见过的文字语言上对多语言模型进行微调，建议根据语言资源水平选择合适的适应方法。

Abstract: Extremely low-resource languages, especially those written in rare scripts,
as shown in Figure 1, remain largely unsupported by large language models
(LLMs). This is due in part to compounding factors such as the lack of training
data. This paper delivers the first comprehensive analysis of whether LLMs can
acquire such languages purely via in-context learning (ICL), with or without
auxiliary alignment signals, and how these methods compare to
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We systematically evaluate 20
under-represented languages across three state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs.
Our findings highlight the limitation of PEFT when both language and its script
are extremely under-represented by the LLM. In contrast, zero-shot ICL with
language alignment is impressively effective on extremely low-resource
languages, while few-shot ICL or PEFT is more beneficial for languages
relatively better represented by LLMs. For LLM practitioners working on
extremely low-resource languages, we summarise guidelines grounded by our
results on adapting LLMs to low-resource languages, e.g., avoiding fine-tuning
a multilingual model on languages of unseen scripts.

Method: 采用检索增强生成(RAG)框架，结合语义检索和上下文摘要技术，实现对盖蒂来源索引-德国拍卖记录的10,000条样本数据进行自然语言和多语言搜索。

Result: 该方法能够有效检索和总结拍卖记录，减少对元数据结构的依赖，为艺术市场档案导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该RAG框架为历史学家和文化遗产专业人士进行历史敏感性研究提供了实用工具，能够有效处理复杂的多语言艺术品来源数据。

Abstract: This research presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for
art provenance studies, focusing on the Getty Provenance Index. Provenance
research establishes the ownership history of artworks, which is essential for
verifying authenticity, supporting restitution and legal claims, and
understanding the cultural and historical context of art objects. The process
is complicated by fragmented, multilingual archival data that hinders efficient
retrieval. Current search portals require precise metadata, limiting
exploratory searches. Our method enables natural-language and multilingual
searches through semantic retrieval and contextual summarization, reducing
dependence on metadata structures. We assess RAG's capability to retrieve and
summarize auction records using a 10,000-record sample from the Getty
Provenance Index - German Sales. The results show this approach provides a
scalable solution for navigating art market archives, offering a practical tool
for historians and cultural heritage professionals conducting historically

Abstract: Quantitative Discourse Analysis has seen growing adoption with the rise of

iterative BERTopic modelling process, incorporating UMAP dimensionality
reduction, HDBSCAN clustering, and c-TF-IDF keyword extraction, optimised
through parameter tuning and multiple runs to enhance topic coherence and
coverage. By juxtaposing precise lexical searches with context-aware semantic
clustering, we argue for a multi-layered approach that mitigates the
limitations of either method in isolation. Our workflow underscores the
importance of code-level transparency, researcher agency, and methodological
triangulation in computational discourse studies. Code and supplementary

### [98] [Do LVLMs Know What They Know? A Systematic Study of Knowledge Boundary Perception in LVLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19111)
*Zhikai Ding,Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答中存在幻觉问题，本文研究其知识边界感知能力，评估三种置信度信号，并提出改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉问答中表现出色但存在幻觉问题，可靠的模型应该能够感知其知识边界。本文旨在研究LVLMs如何感知自己的知识边界。

Method: 评估三种置信度信号：概率置信度、答案一致性置信度和语言化置信度。在三个LVLMs和三个VQA数据集上进行实验，并提出了三种有效的置信度校准方法。

Result: 实验显示LVLMs具有一定的知识边界感知能力，但仍有很大改进空间。概率和一致性置信度信号更可靠，而语言化置信度容易导致过度自信。提出的校准方法有效提升了感知能力。

Conclusion: LVLMs在知识边界感知方面表现尚可但需改进，视觉和文本联合处理虽然降低了问答性能但提升了感知水平，为构建更可靠的视觉语言模型提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong visual question
answering (VQA) capabilities but are shown to hallucinate. A reliable model
should perceive its knowledge boundaries-knowing what it knows and what it does
not. This paper investigates LVLMs' perception of their knowledge boundaries by
evaluating three types of confidence signals: probabilistic confidence, answer
consistency-based confidence, and verbalized confidence. Experiments on three
LVLMs across three VQA datasets show that, although LVLMs possess a reasonable
perception level, there is substantial room for improvement. Among the three
confidences, probabilistic and consistency-based signals are more reliable
indicators, while verbalized confidence often leads to overconfidence. To
enhance LVLMs' perception, we adapt several established confidence calibration
methods from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose three effective methods.
Additionally, we compare LVLMs with their LLM counterparts, finding that
jointly processing visual and textual inputs decreases question-answering
performance but reduces confidence, resulting in an improved perception level
compared to LLMs.

Method: 引入SciReas评测套件和SciReas-Pro子集，提出KRUX分析框架来研究知识和推理的各自作用，并进行深入分析。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了全面的科学推理评测框架和深入的分析见解，为LLM在科学问题解决中的能力提升指明了方向。

Abstract: Scientific problem solving poses unique challenges for LLMs, requiring both
deep domain knowledge and the ability to apply such knowledge through complex
reasoning. While automated scientific reasoners hold great promise for
assisting human scientists, there is currently no widely adopted holistic
benchmark for evaluating scientific reasoning, and few approaches
systematically disentangle the distinct roles of knowledge and reasoning in
these tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce SciReas, a diverse suite of
existing benchmarks for scientific reasoning tasks, and SciReas-Pro, a
selective subset that requires more complex reasoning. Our holistic evaluation
surfaces insights about scientific reasoning performance that remain hidden
when relying on individual benchmarks alone. We then propose KRUX, a probing
framework for studying the distinct roles of reasoning and knowledge in
scientific tasks. Combining the two, we conduct an in-depth analysis that
yields several key findings: (1) Retrieving task-relevant knowledge from model
parameters is a critical bottleneck for LLMs in scientific reasoning; (2)
Reasoning models consistently benefit from external knowledge added in-context
on top of the reasoning enhancement; (3) Enhancing verbalized reasoning
improves LLMs' ability to surface task-relevant knowledge. Finally, we conduct
a lightweight analysis, comparing our science-focused data composition with
concurrent efforts on long CoT SFT, and release SciLit01, a strong 8B baseline
for scientific reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统调研发现，传统可读性指标在普通语言摘要(PLS)评估中与人类判断相关性差，而语言模型能更好地评估可读性，特别是对背景知识等深层因素，并提出了最佳实践建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普通语言摘要领域主要使用传统可读性指标（如FKGL）进行评估，但这些指标在PLS中尚未与人类可读性判断进行系统比较，需要验证其有效性。

Method: 评估了8种传统可读性指标与人类判断的相关性，并测试了语言模型作为可读性评估工具的性能，在PLS数据集上进行了深入分析。

Result: 大多数传统指标（包括最流行的FKGL）与人类判断相关性差，而最佳语言模型达到了0.56的皮尔逊相关系数，能更好地捕捉背景知识等深层可读性因素。

Conclusion: 语言模型比传统指标更适合评估普通语言摘要的可读性，研究提供了评估最佳实践建议并开源了分析代码和调研数据。

Abstract: Plain Language Summarization (PLS) aims to distill complex documents into
accessible summaries for non-expert audiences. In this paper, we conduct a
thorough survey of PLS literature, and identify that the current standard
practice for readability evaluation is to use traditional readability metrics,
such as Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL). However, despite proven utility in
other fields, these metrics have not been compared to human readability
judgments in PLS. We evaluate 8 readability metrics and show that most
correlate poorly with human judgments, including the most popular metric, FKGL.
We then show that Language Models (LMs) are better judges of readability, with
the best-performing model achieving a Pearson correlation of 0.56 with human
judgments. Extending our analysis to PLS datasets, which contain summaries
aimed at non-expert audiences, we find that LMs better capture deeper measures
of readability, such as required background knowledge, and lead to different
conclusions than the traditional metrics. Based on these findings, we offer
recommendations for best practices in the evaluation of plain language
summaries. We release our analysis code and survey data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于请求-响应的线性对话模式在多轮、信息密集和探索性任务中效率低下，限制了LLM作为助手、副驾驶和顾问的潜力

Method: 提出生成式语言模型界面框架，利用结构化界面特定表示和迭代优化，将用户查询转换为任务特定的用户界面，实现更自适应和交互式的参与

Result: 生成式界面在70%以上的情况下被人类用户偏好，在功能、交互和情感体验等多个维度上一致优于传统对话式界面

Conclusion: 生成式界面为人类-AI交互的未来发展指明了方向，明确了用户偏好此类界面的时机和原因

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly seen as assistants, copilots,
and consultants, capable of supporting a wide range of tasks through natural
conversation. However, most systems remain constrained by a linear
request-response format that often makes interactions inefficient in
multi-turn, information-dense, and exploratory tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose Generative Interfaces for Language Models, a paradigm
in which LLMs respond to user queries by proactively generating user interfaces
(UIs) that enable more adaptive and interactive engagement. Our framework
leverages structured interface-specific representations and iterative
refinements to translate user queries into task-specific UIs. For systematic
evaluation, we introduce a multidimensional assessment framework that compares
generative interfaces with traditional chat-based ones across diverse tasks,
interaction patterns, and query types, capturing functional, interactive, and
emotional aspects of user experience. Results show that generative interfaces
consistently outperform conversational ones, with humans preferring them in
over 70% of cases. These findings clarify when and why users favor generative
interfaces, paving the way for future advancements in human-AI interaction.

TL;DR: 通过路由器间控制的交叉模态特征融合方案，根据音频低质量令牌的评分动态调整音视频依赖，在噪声环境中显著提升语音识别程度

Motivation: 解决现有音视频语音识别系统在噪声环境中无法准确估计音频可靠性和动态调整模态依赖的问题

Method: 设计了路由器间控制的交叉模态特征融合框架，通过音频视频特征融合基础的路由器根据令牌级音响度评分动态重新加权音频和视觉特征，在每个解码器层中使用闸门交叉注意力机制强化视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上实验显示，该方法相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词误率降低，在真实世界音响噪声条件下显著提升了系统稳健性

Conclusion: 路由器和闸门机制的结合有效地提升了音视频语音识别在噪声环境中的适应能力，证明了动态模态调整策略的重要性

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测，比较了基于合成数据训练的神经网络和基于模板匹配的方法在真实声纳数据上的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下3D目标检测面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，获取真实声纳标注数据成本高昂且复杂。研究旨在探索是否能在没有真实训练数据的情况下实现可靠的水下3D检测。

Method: 提出了两种免训练检测范式：1）基于物理的声纳模拟管道生成合成数据训练最先进神经网络；2）基于模型的模板匹配系统，利用目标物体的几何先验知识。

Result: 在波罗的海真实测深数据评估显示：合成数据训练的神经网络在模拟场景达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上降至40%；而模板匹配方法无需训练即可在真实数据上保持83% mAP，对声学噪声和环境变化表现出卓越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了水下领域数据密集型深度学习的传统观念，建立了首个大规模免训练水下3D检测基准，为数据稀缺环境下的自主水下航行器导航、海洋考古和海上基础设施监测开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Motivation: 当前脑肿瘤MRI检测方法存在泛化性差、计算效率低、缺乏可解释性和透明度等问题，限制了临床可信度，需要开发更高效、可解释的通用模型。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn融合模型，结合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流架构，采用特征级融合，在增强的6020个MRI数据集上进行训练，使用5折交叉验证，并通过GradCAM提供可视化解释。

Result: 模型训练准确率99.75%，测试准确率98.35%，F1分数0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920），比VGG19准确率提升3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%，GradCAM热图清晰显示肿瘤区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一种高效、高性能、可解释的模型，具有成为临床实用工具的潜力，能够准确识别脑肿瘤并提供临床显著的可视化定位。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面的系统性缺陷，特别是当实体引用从文本变为视觉时模型知识回忆能力的下降

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs在不同引用方式下的表现差异，使用内部状态探针检测模型不可靠响应，并在视觉问答任务中进行选择性预测验证

Result: 视觉引用使VLMs的事实知识回忆能力减半，内部状态探针检测不可靠响应的准确率超过92%，选择性预测中覆盖度提高7.87%同时错误风险降低0.9%

Conclusion: VLMs存在可检测的系统性多模态基础缺陷，内部状态探针能有效识别不可靠响应，这为改善语言基础提供了重要方向和实用工具

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法忽视模态特定结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型质量、可解释性和鲁棒性

Method: SSU框架：1)动态构建模态特定图（文本用语法，音视频用文本引导注意力）2)基于全局文本语义的语义锚点实现跨模态对齐3)多视图对比学习目标

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著降低计算开销，定性分析验证了可解释性和情感模式捕捉能力

Conclusion: SSU通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，实现了性能、效率和可解释性的平衡

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速人脸重建框架，能够从任意姿态的单张人脸图像在10毫秒内生成高质量的3D模型，比优化方法快1000倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3D重建方法要么需要长时间优化（如FlashAvatar），要么重建质量不足（如GAGAvatar），无法满足实时交互应用的需求。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络设计，先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后通过身份编码预测高斯参数残差，实现快速前馈推理。

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法，运行速度比优化方法快1000倍，并支持实时身份插值和属性编辑。

Conclusion: FastAvatar结合了优秀的重建质量和极快的速度，扩展了3D高斯泼溅在消费级和交互式系统中照片级真实感头像应用的范围。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

TL;DR: 视觉基础模型在关系推理上存在限制，该研究提出通过动态关系图增强FM的方案，在多个领域实现了更好的细粒度识别、稳健性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在表征学习方面表现优异，但在需要显式关系推理的任务上存在显著限制，特别是在实体、角色和空间时间关系的处理方面

Method: 提出在基础模型中集成显式关系接口，具体实现为动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推理），通过轻量级、上下文适配的图推理模块增强FM

Result: 在人类操作动作识别和脑继流分割等领域的跨领域实验中，证明增强图推理模块的混合模型相比传统FM基线在细粒度语义保真度、分布外稳健性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率

Conclusion: 提出了一个有针对性的研究议程，优先考虑学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合，以及直接探测结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议，为下一代基础模型的发展指明了方向

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于车牌可读性分类的新数据集LPLC，包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌，用于判断车牌是否需要超分辨率处理或是否完全不可恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车牌识别中低质量车牌识别困难的问题，优化模型性能和计算效率，通过选择性图像预处理来提高可读性。

Method: 采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四个可读性类别（完美、良好、差、不可读），并为三个类别提供字符标签。使用三个图像识别网络（ViT、ResNet、YOLO）作为基准进行分类任务。

Result: 三个基线模型的总体F1分数均低于80%，表明任务难度较大，需要进一步研究。超分辨率和车牌识别方法的分析也验证了这一点。

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，基准测试结果显示了该任务的挑战性，强调了在该领域进行更多研究的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

TL;DR: CLARIFY是一个专门用于皮肤科视觉问答的专家-通才框架，通过结合轻量级图像分类器和压缩对话模型，在提高诊断准确性的同时显著降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗专业任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，实现临床部署的可行性

Method: 采用专家-通才框架：轻量级领域训练图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断，压缩对话VLM（通才）生成自然语言解释，结合知识图谱检索确保回答准确性

Result: 在皮肤科多模态数据集上，诊断准确率比最强基线提高18%，平均VRAM需求降低20%，延迟减少5%

Conclusion: 专家-通才系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，结合TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP模型来检测监控视频中的异常事件，无需在训练时接触异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件具有不可预测性和上下文依赖性。传统方法需要大量异常样本进行训练，而零样本方法可以避免这个问题。

Method: 采用混合架构：TimeSformer作为视觉骨干提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示以识别时间偏差，CLIP基于语义流通过上下文特定文本提示实现概念级异常检测。使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并引入上下文门控机制增强决策。

Result: 该框架能够整合预测建模和视觉语言理解，在复杂环境中泛化到未见过的行为，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白。

Conclusion: 提出的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架通过结合时空建模和语义理解，有效解决了监控视频中异常检测的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一种无需人工标注的自监督3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量实时生成运动伪标签，并跨模态传输到LiDAR域，在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著超越现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统在动态环境中安全导航所需的3D场景流估计问题，当前自监督方法性能不足而监督方法标注成本高昂，需要开发无需人工标注的鲁棒解决方案。

Method: 提出跨模态标签传输方法，直接从4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和歧义消除传播将标签传输到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅使用10%的标注数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow框架成功实现了无需人工标注的高性能3D场景流估计，显著提高了标签效率，为自动驾驶感知系统提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一个从卫星图像和粗略几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，解决了现有方法在建筑结构恢复和细节化方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视角度准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法又过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单几何先验（如长方体）生成满意结果。

Method: 建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换过程，实现灵活的几何控制且不增加计算成本。同时开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了卫星图像3D建筑生成的几何准确性和细节化问题，通过创新的转换建模和大规模数据集支持，实现了高质量的3D建筑生成。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，高效识别地图过渡点对客户端自动地图制作和关卡设计评估至关重要。需要形成化过渡点检测任务并为未来AI导航工具奠定基础。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流水线：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在空间过渡点(STP)，第二阶段通过融合局部和全局视觉特征的轻量级MSTP选择器排名主要过渡点。采用参数高效的adapter技术，包含可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五款动作RPG游戏的自建数据集上验证方法。完整网络微调在数据充足时STP检测效果更好，而adapter转移在少数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健高效。

Conclusion: 成功定义了新的空间过渡点检测问题，提供了基线流水线和数据集，为未来AI驱动导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具奠定了基础，并在高效模型适配方面提供了初步见解。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法在语音和歌唱场景中表现良好，但在复杂的影视制作中（需要细腻的角色互动、真实的身体动作和动态摄影）存在不足，无法满足电影级动画的需求。

Method: 基于Wan构建的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过增强表现力和保真度来适应电影级动画制作需求。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V模型成功解决了电影级角色动画的长期挑战，为复杂影视制作提供了更高质量和表现力的音频驱动动画解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过特征重组策略增强了特征组合多样性和粒度，克服了信息封闭问题，提升了专家网络对解耦特征间信息的捕获能力

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜像效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器实现视频修复模型；引入额外监督显式预测副作用区域；通过差分掩码定位受影响区域。

Conclusion: 该框架通过系统性处理对象副作用和合成数据训练，显著提升了视频对象移除的质量和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕方法存在运动-细节不平衡问题，模型往往过分强调一个方面而忽视另一个方面，导致字幕不完整，影响视频理解和生成的一致性。

Method: 1) 数据层面：通过两阶段流程（运动-细节融合和细粒度检查）构建HMD-270K数据集；2) 优化层面：基于组相对策略优化提出Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)，通过单元到集合匹配和双向验证增强完整性和准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的HMD-270K数据集和CSER优化方法有效解决了运动-细节不平衡问题，OwlCap模型在视频字幕任务上表现出色，相关资源将公开以促进研究社区发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

TL;DR: 提出SFormer方法，在频率域使用SNR先验，通过傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器和频率自适应变换器，有效提升水下图像增强效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构同时抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出在频率域使用SNR先验，将特征分解为振幅和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)结合频谱交互和SNR线索；使用频率自适应变换器(FAT)瓶颈融合高低频分支；构建统一U型架构整合RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1 dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频率域SNR先验方法有效克服了空间域方法的局限性，SFormer在性能指标和视觉质量上都超越了现有方法

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

*Dongfang Wang,Jian Yang,Yizhe Zhang,Tao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层时空分割网络(Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network)用于超声心动图视频的左心室心内膜分割，通过结合局部细节建模和全局动态感知来提高射血分数(EF)估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在射血分数估计方面表现不佳，需要同时处理单帧细节和多帧时空关系来改善EF估计准确性。

Method: 采用分层设计：低层使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层使用Mamba架构捕获时空关系。提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块，通过跨帧和位置的跳跃扫描整合长距离上下文信息。

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免单帧处理的局部误差累积问题，同时克服多帧数据忽略细节的问题，减少超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差。

Conclusion: 提出的分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效改善了超声心动图视频中左心室心内膜分割和射血分数估计的准确性。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和扩展性不足的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中达到或超越最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: FPS为迁移学习提供了一个简单、有效且通用的域适应范式，特别适用于需要高效计算和良好可解释性的域适应任务。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Conclusion: 该框架通过混合深度学习和优化特征选择，实现了高效、轻量化的人体行为识别，为智能监控、医疗健康等实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局变形方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性变形建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致全局变形。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关变形。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中引导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Motivation: 解决神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测倾向于多数类而忽视少数类，导致少数类识别性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别级别，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水阈值，抑制多数类过拟合的同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提升了少数类的分类性能并获得更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理不平衡数据集分类问题的有效方法，能够平衡不同类别的学习过程，提高模型整体性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋生态监测中不同物种检测性能存在显著差异，但其根本原因不明，需要系统性分析并提出改进方案

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将物体检测任务分解为定位和分类两个子任务，采用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析戴壁类别的表现问题

Result: 发现前景-背景区分是最大问题，甚至在数据均衡时仍存在精度空间，说明问题在于内在特征挑战而非数据缺乏

Conclusion: 建议根据优先级选择数据分布策略（不均衡数据提升精度，均衡数据提升召回率），并重点改进定住模块算法

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度范数来评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得均匀变小而失效，无法有效结合课程学习与SAM优化

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本之间的归一化损失差距来量化对抗脆弱性，在平坦区域仍保持信息性，并将其集成到基于课程学习的SAM训练中

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上评估，方法同时保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，优于现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了在平坦优化景观中有效的样本难度评估方法，成功实现了课程学习与SAM优化的有效结合，提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶方法直接从原始数据推导控制命令，但由于深度神经网络的非线性决策边界，难以解释AI决策逻辑，这在复杂城市场景中尤其重要。需要提升AI决策的可解释性来确保自动驾驶的可信度。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，能够持续生成事件并改善下游感知任务的性能，无需复杂硬件。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测标准在评价生成式VLM时存在问题：只要正确预测与标注不完全匹配就会被判为错误，而图片常常存在多种合理解释。需要一个能同时适用于专门HOI方法和通用VLM的评测标准。

Method: 将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，每个问题包含真实正确选项和细心构造的负面选项（避免将合理的其他解释作为负面选项），允许多个正确答案。

Conclusion: 通过重构HOI检测为多选题形式，新标准能够更公平地评价不同方法的性能，并为HOI理解领域提供新的见解。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI

Method: 结合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，CmOS在内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同学科和教育水平。

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育多选题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 废物分类对可持续回收至关重要，但该领域的AI研究因数据集有限和依赖传统目标检测器而落后于商业系统。

Method: 首先在ZeroWaste数据集上评估开放词汇目标检测模型，然后微调基于transformer的检测器，最后提出使用空间和共识感知加权的软伪标签策略进行半监督训练。

Result: LLM优化的提示词显著提升了零样本准确率，微调模型达到51.6 mAP的新基准，半监督训练性能甚至超过了全监督训练。

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字体形状与印象标签关系的新型嵌入方法，通过构建印象标签共现图并进行谱嵌入，在印象引导的字体生成任务中优于BERT和CLIP等标准词嵌入方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传达不同的视觉印象，字体形状与描述这些印象的标签之间存在密切关系。传统词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在处理印象标签时无法有效捕捉这种形状-印象关系。

Method: 构建印象标签共现图（节点为印象标签，边编码共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术为每个标签生成印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法在印象引导的字体生成任务上表现优于BERT和CLIP方法，能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似的向量表示。

Conclusion: 所提出的谱嵌入方法能够有效捕捉字体形状与印象标签之间的关系，特别适用于基于印象的字体生成和字体检索任务。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练的遥感基础模型的深度特征，在荷兰岛屏毛毛的标签数据下将树种分类准确度提高了10%，远超传统手工设计的物候特征方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家森林调查(NFI)需要耗费大量人力进行现场调查，而遥感技术结合机器学习可以更频繁地更新NFI数据。目前的方法主要依赖随机森林分类器和手工设计的物候特征，需要更有效的方法来提高分类准确性。

Method: 使用Google Earth Engine提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5和SRTM卫星数据的时间序列数据，然后对公开可用的遥感时间序基础模型进行微调，利用其深度特征来进行树种分类。

Result: 在荷兰NFI分类任务中，微调预训练模型的方法比当前最先进方法准确性提高了连10%，在所有数据集上都表现优异。

Conclusion: 经典的手工设计调和特征对于树种分类任务过于简单，而深度AI特征在数据有限的应用中展现出巨大潜力。通过利用开政卫星数据和预训练模型，这种方法可以有效补充现有的森林调查过程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

solution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures
for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法用于微表情分析，通过可扩展的时间间隔选择策略和协同优化框架，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法大多依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉复杂的时序动态。虽然近期方法采用视频级回归框架，但间隔解码仍依赖手动预定义的基于窗口的方法，问题仅得到部分缓解

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的间隔选择策略和协同优化框架，有效解决了微表情分析中的时序动态捕捉问题，显著提升了性能表现

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Motivation: 微行网状绷合需要高超技能，但现有评估方法依赖主观判断，存在偏差和可靠性问题

Method: 利用三个医院数据集，采用图像处理技术进行定量分析，包括几何错误建模和检测评分机制

Result: 几何指标能够有效复现专家评分者对网状绷合错误的评分

Conclusion: 该定量框架提高了微行外科技能评估的效率和可靠性，推进了培训协议的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的视频稳定方法，通过测试时快速自适应来改进像素级合成视频稳定技术，利用推理时的低层视觉线索提升输出稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能合成全帧输出，但由于视频序列中运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，使用固定参数难以实现鲁棒的泛化性能。

Method: 采用快速自适应策略，在测试时针对每个输入视频快速调整模型参数；提出抖动定位模块和针对性自适应策略，重点对高抖动片段进行自适应优化；利用推理时可用的低层视觉线索。

Result: 即使仅进行单次自适应也能获得显著的性能提升；在各种真实数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性；能够持续改进多种全帧合成模型的性能，包括定性定量评估和下游应用结果。

Conclusion: 该方法使现代稳定器能够超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持现代方法的全帧特性，并为用户提供类似经典方法的控制机制，在稳定性和视觉质量方面均有显著改善。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

TL;DR: DualFairVL是一个多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，在医学影像诊断中实现公平性和准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 解决医学影像诊断中跨模态偏差问题，确保不同人口群体间的公平性，特别是在分布偏移情况下。现有方法通常独立处理视觉和文本模态，导致残留的跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点，通过交叉注意力机制生成融合特征。使用超网络解耦属性相关信息并生成实例感知的视觉提示，应用基于原型的正则化来分离敏感特征。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医学影像诊断中的公平性问题，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了模型在不同人口群体间的公平性表现。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，因此需要分别增强对象和交互查询

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型能更有效地以对象感知方式关注与对象交互的人类；2) 设计交互语义融合模块，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能

Conclusion: DQEN通过分别增强对象和交互查询，有效提升了HOI检测的性能，证明了对象感知和语义特征融合的重要性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成式AI的地图制作方法，通过整合矢量数据来指导不同风格的地图生成，解决了传统GIS制图需要专业知识且耗时的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GIS制图需要专业知识且耗时，特别是重复性任务。生成式AI（特别是图像扩散模型）为自动化和民主化地图制作提供了新机会，但现有模型在空间构图和语义布局控制方面存在局限。

Method: 整合矢量数据来指导文本提示指定的不同风格地图生成，开发了首个能够生成精确风格控制地图的模型，并将其集成到Web应用程序中提高可用性和可访问性。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI辅助制图范式的潜力，同时指出了进一步的技术改进方向，并强调了制图师在AI辅助制图新时代中的新角色。

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合token混合、序列池化和卷积tokenizer的视觉模型，在固定上下文长度任务中实现了SOTA性能和高效推理，在CIFAR100上显著提升准确率且模型更小更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统Transformer模型在固定上下文长度任务中的计算效率问题，同时保持高性能，需要开发更高效的架构。

Method: 采用token混合、序列池化和卷积tokenizer的组合方法，构建高效视觉模型，不依赖数据增强、位置编码和学习率调度等技术。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，top-1准确率从36.50%提升至46.29%，top-5准确率从66.33%提升至76.31%，模型大小仅为SDPA Transformer的60%，且在上下文长度小于嵌入维度时更高效。

Conclusion: 该架构在保持高性能的同时实现了更高的计算效率，训练稳定性好，为固定上下文长度任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO是一个统一的风格-主体优化定制模型，通过解耦学习和风格奖励学习，同时实现风格相似性和主体一致性的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献通常将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显的对抗性。作者认为这两个目标可以在统一框架下解决，因为它们都涉及内容和风格的解耦与重组。

Method: 1) 构建大规模三元组数据集；2) 引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并解耦内容与风格；3) 结合风格奖励学习(SRL)范式提升性能；4) 发布首个联合评估风格相似性和主体保真度的基准USO-Bench。

Result: 大量实验表明，USO在开源模型中实现了主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上的最先进性能。

Conclusion: USO成功地将风格驱动和主体驱动生成统一在一个框架下，通过内容和风格的解耦与重组，同时实现了优秀的风格相似性和主体一致性。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估NeRF隐私保护的新协议，并开发了ppNeSF方法，通过自监督分割标签替代RGB图像训练，在保护隐私的同时实现准确的视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF在视觉定位中广泛应用，但其编码的精细场景细节存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复。

Method: 提出隐私保护评估协议，并开发ppNeRF变体，使用自监督分割监督替代RGB图像训练，确保标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时保持3D区分性。

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到最先进的结果，分割空间可用于准确的相机姿态估计。

Conclusion: 通过分割监督训练的NeRF变体能够有效保护隐私，同时保持视觉定位性能，为云基定位服务提供了隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在文档视觉问答中引入检索增强生成(RAG)的效果，发现基于文本和视觉的检索方法都能显著提升多页文档问答性能，其中文本检索方法提升达22.5 ANLS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档VQA系统要么拼接所有页面内容，要么依赖大型视觉语言模型，这两种方法都内存消耗巨大。RAG提供了一种通过先检索相关片段再生成答案的替代方案。

Method: 系统评估了两种RAG变体：基于OCR文本的检索和纯视觉检索（无需OCR），在多个模型和基准测试上进行实验，包括MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA数据集。

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体无需文本提取也能实现+5.0 ANLS提升。消融实验确认检索和重排序组件是主要增益来源。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在真实世界应用中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上未能提供帮助。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型在性别、种族、年龄和肤色方面人口统计偏见的基准测试，提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标，发现现有VLMs存在严重偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估框架来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色四个维度，并设计了GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标，对5个最先进的VLMs进行了评估。

Result: 评估结果显示所有VLMs都存在严重的偏见问题，偏见最小的模型GRAS评分仅为2分（满分100分），同时发现VQA评估需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了VLMs存在显著的人口统计偏见，强调了在VQA评估中考虑问题表述多样性的重要性，为偏见检测提供了有效的工具和指标。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，基于Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询实现端到端的屋顶平面分割，通过边缘感知掩码模块和几何损失提升边缘区域分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：1）非真正端到端导致结果非最优；2）边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确；3）平面几何特性考虑不足。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测平面实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块（EAMM）融入平面几何先验；提出自适应权重掩码损失和平面几何损失约束训练。

Result: 该方法实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提升了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度，通过几何约束改善了网络训练效果。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，为从LiDAR点云重建LoD 2和3级三维建筑模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

TL;DR: 微塑料污染严重，本文提出MicroDetect-Net模型，结合莖光显微镜和深度学习检测血液样本中的微塑料颗粒


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微塑料污染已成为全球急诫问题，可导致肝脏感染、肠道损伤等健康风险，需要有效检测方法

Method: 使用Nile Red染料染色和莖光显微镜获取血液图像，通过卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Result: 在276张莖光血液图像数据集上达到92%准确率，IoU 87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精度90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MicroDetect-Net模型在微塑料检测中表现优异，为人类血液样本微塑料监测提供了有前景的技术路径

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：1）提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；2）祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地改进CLIP架构，成功解决了PRVR任务中的多粒度语义建模问题，为视频检索领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Motivation: 心血管健康领域利用大数据进行患者护理具有巨大潜力，但收集足够大的数据集来训练机器学习模型极具挑战性。冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物评估缺乏大规模研究，需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 使用8449个3D血管几何模型进行自监督预训练，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量）创建自监督目标，学习几何表征，然后在小规模临床数据（49名患者）上微调用于壁剪切应力区域分割。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模几何数据集中学习的表征能够显著提升冠状动脉壁剪切应力区域（低、中、高时间平均壁剪切应力）的分割准确性，即使在有限数据条件下也能获得良好性能。

Conclusion: 自监督预训练和基础模型可以有效解决医疗领域数据稀缺问题，几何表征学习为血流动力学生物标志物评估提供了有力工具，特别是在冠状动脉壁剪切应力分析方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一不同监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，而这些数据获取成本高且需要专业知识，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 采用轻量级UNet++网络结构，结合专门为神经元形态开发的连通性感知损失函数，显式惩罚线路碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。从每个手稿仅提取3个注释页面中提取小块进行训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了当前最佳方法：识别准确率提高了200%，行交叉比提高了75%。在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛冠军的F-Measure分数，仅需3个注释页面。

Conclusion: 小型简单的网络结构结合拓扑感知损失函数，能够更准确和高效地实现历史文档的文本行分割，显著减少了对大量注释数据的依赖。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

TL;DR: 本文提出两种简单有效的方法（3DTE和TGE）来解决单目3D视觉定位中文本嵌入对数值单位不敏感的问题，显著提升了模型性能，在远距离场景中准确率提升11.94%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有方法中文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致预训练语言模型在3D理解方面存在缺陷，产生误导性文本特征阻碍3D感知

Method: 提出3D文本增强（3DTE）预处理方法增强不同单位映射关系的理解；提出文本引导几何增强（TGE）模块将文本特征投影到几何一致空间，精确引导几何特征注意力

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得显著改进，超越先前方法达到新的state-of-the-art，在"Far"场景中获得11.94%的准确率提升

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知和几何特征，有效解决了文本嵌入对测量单位不敏感的问题，大幅提升了单目3D视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WEF-PE位置编码方法，利用椭圆函数的双周期特性更好地保持图像二维空间结构，在多个视觉任务上取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统位置编码缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力

Method: 基于Weierstrass椭圆函数的位置编码(WEF-PE)，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的双周期特性与视觉数据的平移不变性模式对齐

Result: 在CIFAR-100上ViT-Tiny从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进，理论分析证实距离衰减特性

Conclusion: WEF-PE通过数学原理方法有效编码二维空间关系，提供更强的几何归纳偏置和更连贯的语义焦点，优于传统位置编码方法

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面片，减少网格生成的代序冗余，实现8倍速度提升和更高的网格质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法将三角网格转换为代序化标记，但因为顶点被多个面共享导致代序冗余长，生成效率低

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，用双向Transformer单步完成面片构建，加入保真增强器精细顶点位置，通过后处理移除不良边缘连接

Result: 代序长度降低到现有最紧凑标记方法的23%，网格生成速度提升8倍以上，产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 通过分离顶点和面片生成的框架，有效解决了网格生成中的冗余问题，实现了高效高质量的艺术网格生成

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [168] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个轻量级的All-in-One Slider模块，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，实现了多个属性的细粒度指觨控制，充分解决了以往每个属性需要独立滑块的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在逐步操控生成图像属性方面遇到挑战，特别是对于细节丰富的内容如人脸。传统方法采用One-for-One方式，每个属性需要独立训练滑块，导致参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 设计了All-in-One Slider模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的、具有语义含义的属性方向。该模块训练完成后可作为通用滑块使用，支持多个属性的细粒度持续控制。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法能够实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，较以往方法有显著提升。同时支持对未见属性的零样本操控以及多个属性的组合操作。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider提供了一种轻量级且高效的方案，能够充分解决以往每个属性需要独立滑块的问题，并且可以与逆向框架集成以处理真实图像，扩展了其在实际应用场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Motivation: 现有神经重建方法受限于静态环境和抓取数据的差异性，而图像或视频涵滴模型缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要找到一种方法来桥接这两者的优势。

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，使用学习到的2D图像先验进行分数萃取。通过提示指导的几何生成和高保真纹理结构，可以基于地图布局进行条件化生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功桥接了神经重建方法的几何准确性和涵滴模型的高可控性，为机器人学习提供了大规模、高质量的3D驾驶场景数据。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频角色模型只能产生物理相似的动作，但缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解，通常只与音频节奏等低级线索同步。

Method: 1. 利用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示提供高级语义指导；2. 引入具有伪最后一帧设计的专门Multimodal DiT架构，有效融合多模态输入并缓解模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、运动自然度和与文本提示的语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先性能，并展现出对多人场景和非人类主体的出色扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合高级语义指导和专门的多模态融合架构，成功生成了既物理合理又语义连贯的富有表现力的角色动画，超越了简单的节奏同步方法。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了纳米尺度运动测量的实验挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管是纳米技术的关键构建块，但其动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米尺度运动测量实验挑战的限制。现有方法只能提供静态分析，而原位技术通常需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack集成了手工制作或深度特征检测器和匹配器，在粒子跟踪框架内实现碳纳米管微柱生长的运动学分析。通过13,540条手动注释轨迹的系统性测试，确定了ALIKED检测器与LightGlue匹配器的最优组合。

Result: VFTrack实现了F1分数0.78和α分数0.89的优异性能。运动矢量被分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，有助于计算异质区域生长速率和重建演化的碳纳米管柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的进步，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Motivation: 现有的视频分割方法在处理无提示分割（检测和跟踪视频中所有对象）时存在碎片化问题，需要任务特定的模型和流水线

Method: 将流式视频分割重新构建为序列掩码预测问题，类似于语言建模，使用基于状态空间模型的单一架构AUSM，保持固定大小的空间状态并可处理任意长度视频流

Result: 在多个标准基准测试（DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS）上优于之前的通用流式视频分割方法，16帧序列训练速度提升达2.5倍

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，通过并行训练设计实现了显著的训练加速，为视频分割提供了高效的通用解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究和基准测试的宝贵资源，推动了4D风格化领域的发展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法通过图像生成和姿态优化两个步骤，使用自注意力重连机制和关键点对应关系实现精确的姿态操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型有所进展，但通过语言控制来精确调整3D资产姿态仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题。现有方法在保持网格身份一致性的同时实现自由形式姿态操控方面存在困难。

Method: 1) 修改图像生成器，根据输入图像和文本指令生成目标图像；2) 通过多视角姿态优化将网格与目标图像对齐；3) 引入自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)解耦源结构和姿态；4) 使用关键点而非可微分渲染建立对应关系。

Result: 方法在多样化3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现优异，成功操控姿态的同时保持网格原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练自由方法，通过语言指令精确控制3D资产姿态，在保持身份一致性和姿态操控精度方面显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D局部编辑对于游戏产业和机器人交互至关重要，但现有方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的连贯性。

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹，获取每个时间步的反向潜在表示和键值令牌；在去噪编辑阶段，用缓存的特征替换保留区域的特征，确保一致性。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [176] [Reasoning Steps as Curriculum: Using Depth of Thought as a Difficulty Signal for Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18279)
*Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用思维深度（DoT）作为LLM课程学习的难度信号，通过统计教师模型推理轨迹中的离散步骤来定义难度，并验证了DoT排序课程在推理任务上的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的课程学习需要可扩展且可解释的难度信号，特别是在推理任务中。作者认为人类需要更深层次思考的任务对模型也应该更难，因此提出基于思维深度的难度定义。

Method: 定义思维深度（DoT）为教师模型推理轨迹中的离散步骤数，建立从浅到深的课程排序，并提出了推导、验证和大规模调度的方法。

Result: 论文提出了三个可验证假设：DoT与推理基准的传统难度相关、DoT排序课程在相同预算下优于长度或评分排序课程、难度在不同教师模型间具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理中心的训练提供了认知基础扎实、可解释的课程学习方法，推动了LLM课程学习向更科学的方向发展。

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

TL;DR: 提出多模态机器学习框架，结合句子Transformer嵌入和注意力序列到序列架构，预测海上漂流物的漂移轨迹，在多个时间尺度上表现优于传统物理模型和机器学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测海上漂流物的位移对搜救等时间敏感场景至关重要，现有方法在长期预测和适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 通过实验收集环境物理数据，使用Navier-Stokes模型训练CNN估计阻力升力系数，结合文本描述编码，采用注意力LSTM和Transformer模型进行多模态预测。

Conclusion: 多模态建模策略能够为动态海洋环境中的漂流物提供准确且适应性强的漂移预测，为海上搜救等应用提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态金融风险评估框架，整合文本情感分析和基于声学物理模型的副语言特征，能够显著预测股票波动性而非方向性收益


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融市场信息不对称问题严重，传统文本分析在战略性的企业叙事面前效果有限，需要从更多维度捕捉隐藏的企业不确定性

Method: 开发物理信息声学模型(PIAM)，应用非线性声学从原始电话会议音频中稳健提取情感特征，将声学和文本情感状态映射到三维情感状态标签空间(紧张度、稳定性、唤醒度)，分析高管在脚本化演讲和自发问答环节的情感动态变化

Result: 多模态特征能够解释高达43.8%的30天已实现波动率样本外方差，波动率预测主要受高管从脚本化到自发演讲过渡时的情感动态驱动，特别是CFO的文本稳定性降低和声学不稳定性增加，以及CEO的显著唤醒度变化

Conclusion: 多模态方法显著优于仅使用财务数据的基准模型，声学和文本模态具有互补性，通过解码可验证的生物特征信号中的潜在不确定性标记，为投资者和监管机构提供了增强市场可解释性和识别隐藏企业不确定性的有力工具

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

TL;DR: 开发了一个快速抑郁症检测系统，仅需1秒收集7天应用使用数据，使用机器学习模型识别抑郁症，准确率达82.4%，适用于资源有限地区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症检测系统需要长时间数据收集，无法满足早期快速检测的需求，特别是在资源有限的欠发达和发展中地区。

Method: 开发快速工具收集7天应用使用数据（平均0.31秒），使用多种机器学习模型和特征选择方法（包括稳定特征选择方法和Boruta全相关特征选择），对100名孟加拉学生进行研究。

Result: 轻量梯度提升机模型使用稳定特征选择方法的重要特征，正确识别82.4%的抑郁症学生（精确度75%，F1分数78.5%）；简约堆叠模型使用约5个特征，最大精确度达77.4%（平衡准确率77.9%）。

Conclusion: 该系统快速简约的特点使其在欠发达和发展中地区的抑郁症识别中具有重要价值，研究结果有助于开发资源消耗更少的系统来更好地理解抑郁症学生。

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Motivation: 传统成像遗传学方法局限于简单线性模型或缺乏可解释性的黑盒技术，无法有效捕捉脑结构与遗传变异之间的复杂相互作用。

Method: 采用早期融合策略和交叉注意力机制，引入两个损失函数：稀疏性损失关注最显著相互作用，通路相似性损失确保队列间表示一致性。

Result: 在自闭症谱系障碍和阿尔茨海默病上验证，NeuroPathX优于基线方法，揭示了与疾病相关的生物学合理关联。

Conclusion: NeuroPathX有潜力增进对复杂脑部疾病的理解，代码已开源。

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升

Conclusion: 该框架作为实用的模型无关工具，可提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for learning the spatio-temporal dynamics of
vector valued functions by combining operator valued reproducing kernel Hilbert

establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive
Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide
spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations.
This framework supports efficient reduced order modeling and long term
prediction of high dimensional nonlinear systems, offering theoretically
grounded tools for forecasting, control, and uncertainty quantification in
spatio-temporal machine learning.

<details>

Motivation: 位置编码在Transformer架构中已被证明有效，但传统方法存在长期衰减问题且计算复杂度较高，需要一种既能有效编码位置信息又具有更好计算效率的新方法。

Method: 提出CoPE复数位置编码架构，使用复数嵌入（实部捕获语义内容，虚部编码位置信息），在第一层Transformer中使用相位感知注意力机制捕获位置相关模式，后续层使用标准注意力机制。

Result: CoPE不表现出长期衰减现象，与线性注意力兼容，在GLUE基准测试中相比RoPE、正弦和学习位置编码实现了更优的性能和更低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 复数位置编码CoPE是一种有效的替代方案，能够同时编码内容和位置信息，在保持高性能的同时降低了计算复杂度，为Transformer模型的位置编码提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

Conclusion: 提高选中回答质量是构建高效偏好数据集的关键，这为LLM对齐提供了重要实践见解。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Motivation: 现有的医疗AI研究往往只关注电子健康记录(EHR)数据的孤立组成部分，限制了预测性能和可解释性。需要一种能够充分利用EHR丰富多层次结构的方法。

Method: 提出ProtoEHR框架：1)利用大语言模型提取医疗代码语义关系构建知识图谱；2)设计分层表示学习框架，在医疗代码、医院就诊和患者三个层次捕获上下文表示；3)在每个层次中融入原型信息来捕捉内在相似性和提升泛化能力。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上评估了五个临床重要任务（死亡率预测、再入院预测、住院时长预测、药物推荐、表型预测），结果显示ProtoEHR相比文献中的基线方法能够做出更准确、鲁棒和可解释的预测。

Conclusion: ProtoEHR能够充分利用EHR数据的多层次结构，提供准确、鲁棒且可解释的医疗预测，同时在代码、就诊和患者层面提供可解释的洞察，有助于医疗决策。

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电数据常因传感器故障和传输不稳定而缺失，联邦学习虽然能保护隐私协作，但仍面临异常更新和参数交换中的隐私泄露风险，特别是在开放的工业环境中需要零信任机制。

Method: 提出ZTFed-MAS2S框架，整合多头注意力序列到序列填补模型，使用可验证差分隐私和非交互式零知识证明，采用动态信任感知聚合机制，通过相似图传播信任，并利用稀疏化和量化压缩减少通信开销。

Result: 在真实风电场数据集上的大量实验验证了ZTFed-MAS2S在联邦学习性能和缺失数据填补方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架为能源领域的实际应用提供了一个安全高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in

### [189] [Linear cost mutual information estimation and independence test of similar performance as HSIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18338)
*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSIC是当前最先进的统计依赖性评估方法，但计算复杂度高(O(n^2.37))。本文提出HCR方法，具有线性计算成本(O(n))，更高的依赖性敏感性，并能提供联合分布模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC方法在处理大规模数据样本时计算成本过高(n×n矩阵乘法)，需要一种更高效的替代方案来评估数据样本间的统计依赖性。

Method: 提出HCR(分层相关性重建)方法，通过混合矩特征描述依赖性，从相关性和同方差性开始。每个依赖性描述特征可在O(n)线性时间内计算。

Result: HCR方法不仅计算效率更高(线性复杂度)，而且在测试中表现出比HSIC更高的依赖性敏感性，同时还能提供实际的联合分布模型和近似互信息。

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的高效实用替代方案，具有线性计算成本、更高的敏感性，并能提供更丰富的依赖性描述信息，适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

TL;DR: 通过后训练专家分区和动态计算丢弃技术，DualSparse-MoE系统在保持模型准确性的同时实现了显著的计算效率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然混合专家模型(MoE)通过稀疏激活提高了效率，但仍面临大规模计算和不可预测激活模式的挑战，需要更有效的部署方案

Method: 识别张量级和神经元级双重稀疏性，通过后训练专家分区引入张量级稀疏性，结合动态张量级计算丢弃和静态神经元级重建

Result: 在三个主流MoE模型上，约25%计算丢弃率仅导致0.08%-0.28%的准确性下降，计算速度按比例提升，加入负载均衡后实现1.41x模块速度提升

Conclusion: 通过利用双重稀疏性和后训练技术，DualSparse-MoE系统能够在几乎保持模型准确性的前提下，实现显著的计算效率提升，为大规模MoE模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境中传统强化学习因反馈稀少而学习困难的问题

Method: 集成变分状态内在奖励(VSIMR)和基于大语言模型(LLM)的内在奖励方法，使用A2C代理在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中实现

Result: 组合策略相比单独策略或标准A2C代理显著提高了性能和采样效率，标准A2C代理完全无法学习

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向的利用，两种策略在环境和任务的不同方面形成有效互补

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Result: 方法提高了TuRBO的有效性，在合成函数和实际应用中优于多种高维贝叶斯优化技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了全局建模的采样效率和局部建模的异构性优势，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件描述语言(HDL)如Verilog在代码生成领域得到的关注较少，主要因为其并发语义、语法严格性和模拟复杂性带来的挑战。需要专门的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 构建Veribench-53K高质量数据集；提出Trace-back重新评分机制，利用推理路径和迭代精细来提高反馈可靠性；采用样本均衡权重策略来平衡学习动态；建立迭代强化学习流水线，共同迭代策略模型和奖励模型。

Conclusion: 这个工作呈现了强化学习驱动方法在硬件相关领域结构化代码生成中的潜力，通过设计专门的奖励机制和学习策略有效解决了HDL代码生成的特有挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界异常检测任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够有效处理低标签环境下的异常检测问题。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Conclusion: 神经网络能够执行任何推理任务，将算法运行时间（电路运行时间）与空间复杂度（神经元数量）进行权衡，结果比经典通用近似定理更强大

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态问题，实现了实例级和模态级的动态权重调整，具有良好的扩展性和实用性

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂系统中长期精度下降，自回归训练需要大量GPU内存且可能牺牲短期性能，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: SPF框架从模型预测构建补充数据集，通过随机采集策略结合真实数据，在epoch间预计算多步预测，避免存储完整展开序列。

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF比自回归方法获得更高的长期精度，同时降低内存需求。

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了有前景的解决方案，在保持内存效率的同时提升了长期预测性能。

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺情况下从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质功能的挑战，特别是在只有少量标记序列功能数据时的机器学习指导蛋白质设计问题

Method: 使用在微调ESM2嵌入上训练的稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，评估其在多种适应性外推和蛋白质工程任务中的表现

Result: SAEs在适应性预测中始终优于或与ESM2基线竞争，其稀疏潜在空间编码了紧凑且具有生物学意义的表示，能够从有限数据中更有效地泛化

Conclusion: SAEs为低数据量蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效的解决方案，通过利用pLM表示中的生物基序，显著提高了蛋白质设计的成功率

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Motivation: 药物发现过程复杂且资源密集，早期预测批准结果对优化研发投资至关重要。传统机器学习和深度学习方法在药物批准预测中表现出潜力，但可解释性有限限制了其实际影响。

Method: 基于LLaMA架构构建DrugReasoner模型，使用GRPO进行微调，整合分子描述符并与结构相似的已批准和未批准化合物进行对比推理，生成预测结果的同时提供逐步推理过程和置信度评分。

Result: 在验证集上AUC为0.732，F1分数为0.729；测试集上AUC为0.725，F1分数为0.718。在外部独立数据集上AUC为0.728，F1分数为0.774，优于基线方法和ChemAP模型，保持高精度和平衡的敏感性。

Conclusion: DrugReasoner不仅提供有竞争力的预测准确性，还通过推理输出增强透明度，解决了AI辅助药物发现中的关键瓶颈，展示了推理增强LLM作为可解释且有效的药物决策工具的潜力。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL是一个针对大语言模型强化学习的系统，通过利用历史rollout响应的相似性，使用推测解码和两层调度策略，在保持训练精度的同时实现了2.6倍的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL系统存在GPU利用率低的问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。现有解决方案如异步执行和截断会牺牲训练精度来换取效率。

Method: 提出了RhymeRL系统，包含两个关键创新：1) HistoSpec - 基于历史rollout令牌序列相似性的推测解码推理引擎；2) HistoPipe - 基于历史rollout分布相似性的两层调度策略来平衡工作负载。

Result: 在真实生产环境中评估，展示了从几十到数千个GPU的可扩展性，相比现有方法实现了2.6倍的性能提升，且不损害精度或修改RL范式。

Conclusion: 通过利用历史rollout响应的相似性，RhymeRL有效解决了RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，在保持训练质量的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based

the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度特征提取和不确定性估计的结合，有效提升了时间序列无监督域适配的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对时间序列数据稀缺城市的预测框架，通过选择性迁移学习和检索增强推理来改善城市预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市预测模型面临严重的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集的长期记录，而许多其他城市只有短期或不完整的历史数据。直接迁移会导致噪声和负迁移

Method: 结合领域适配检索和推理能力强大的大模型，使用基于补丁的时间编码器识别与目标查询语义和动态对齐的源子序列，然后通过LLM进行检索引导的结构化推理

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥的三个停车可用性数据集上的广泛实验表明，STRATA-TS始终优于强大的预测和迁移基线

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的知识迁移路径，并通过监督微调将推理过程蒸馏到紧凑的开放模型中，实现高效部署

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型缺乏可解释性，且未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构来理解免疫治疗的耐药机制

Method: 使用模块化编码器架构和变分推理，整合转录组和基因组数据，通过通路特异性编码器学习具有生物学意义的潜在特征

Result: 在366名患者的泛癌队列中达到0.94的AUC-ROC，揭示了免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物学结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Motivation: 随着基础模型向AGI发展，在隐私和资源约束下进行微调变得至关重要。联邦学习通过联邦微调实现协作模型适配，但现有的LoRA方法在异构FL环境中存在结构不兼容和非IID数据适应性问题。

Method: 提出FFT MoE框架，用MoE适配器替代LoRA，每个客户端训练轻量级门控网络选择激活个性化专家子集，并引入异构感知辅助损失来平衡专家负载。

Result: 在IID和非IID条件下的广泛实验表明，FFT MoE在泛化性能和训练效率方面始终优于最先进的FFT基线方法。

Conclusion: FFT MoE框架有效解决了联邦微调中的异构性问题，通过MoE结构和动态路由平衡机制实现了更好的适应性和效率。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法专注于移除特定数据的影响，但假设保留数据不受影响。然而隐私洋葱效应表明这种假设可能不正确，特别是在差分隐私模型下，尚无研究验证保留数据是否仍满足差分隐私标准。

Method: 提出从差分隐私和成员推理攻击角度分别评估遗忘样本和保留样本的隐私标准；开发高效成员推理攻击方法A-LiRA，利用数据增强减少影子模型训练成本。

Result: 实验发现现有近似机器学习遗忘算法可能会无意中损害差分隐私模型中保留样本的隐私。

Conclusion: 需要开发差分隐私遗忘算法来确保保留样本的隐私保护，现有方法存在隐私风险。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型的稀疏性对记忆能力和推理能力有不同影响：记忆性能随总参数增加而提升，但推理性能会饱和甚至下降，即使训练损失继续改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩展定律主要针对密集模型，而MoE模型引入了新的稀疏维度，需要研究稀疏性如何影响不同能力（记忆vs推理）的表现。

Method: 训练一系列MoE Transformer模型，系统性地改变总参数、激活参数和top-k路由，同时保持计算预算固定。记录预训练损失、下游任务损失和任务准确率。

Result: 记忆基准测试随总参数单调改善，与训练损失一致；推理性能会饱和甚至回归，尽管总参数和训练损失继续增益。改变top-k路由对性能影响很小，后训练强化学习和额外测试计算都无法挽救过度稀疏模型的推理缺陷。

Conclusion: MoE模型的稀疏性需要在记忆和推理能力之间进行权衡，过度稀疏会损害推理性能，且这种缺陷难以通过后续技术修复。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Conclusion: LRTab成功地将微调的数据特定学习优势与零样本提示的泛化性优势相结合，通过检索学习到的提示条件来提升表格理解和推理的性能。

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖人工特征工程，难以处理电子健康记录中不规则、不完整的时间序列数据，需要开发更有效的脓毒症早期检测方法。

Method: 使用无监督自编码器进行自动特征提取，结合多层感知器分类器；采用定制下采样策略提取高信息密度片段，以及非重叠动态滑动窗口机制进行实时推理；预处理时间序列数据时包含明确的缺失指示器。

Result: 在三个ICU队列中分别获得74.6%、80.6%和93.5%的准确率，持续优于传统机器学习基线方法（朴素贝叶斯、SVM、随机森林、XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 该框架在异质ICU环境中展现出优异的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，适用于脓毒症的早期检测。

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 提出结构感知图自监督学习框架，从CDFG学习结构信息表示，并采用知识蒸馏策略将后映射网表的低级洞察转移到CDFG预测器中。

Result: 在各种质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中非常有效。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

TL;DR: FLAegis是一个两阶段联邦学习防御框架，通过符号时间序列转换和谱聚类检测拜占庭客户端，并采用FFT聚合函数增强系统鲁棒性，在多种投毒攻击下表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可视性，依赖客户端诚实性，这为恶意拜占庭客户端提供了投毒攻击的机会，需要有效的防御机制。

Method: 提出FLAegis两阶段防御框架：1）使用符号时间序列转换（SAX）放大良性模型与恶意模型的差异；2）采用谱聚类精确检测对抗行为；3）集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终防护层。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）的严格评估中，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提升了联邦学习系统对拜占庭客户端攻击的防御能力，通过多阶段检测和聚合机制确保了训练过程的可靠性和模型质量。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习中的Bellman残差最小化方法，提出了新的统计稳定性分析框架，获得了O(1/n)的样本复杂度改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习实践中难以有效执行Bellman一致性约束，虽然Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法已被提出，但其在离线设置下的统计行为尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，获得O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性边界，无需方差缩减、额外正则化或严格的minibatch采样独立性假设。

Result: 实现了样本复杂度指数的翻倍改进，获得了O(1/n)的超额风险边界，适用于标准神经网络参数化和minibatch SGD。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了BRM方法在离线设置下的统计理论空白，为Bellman一致性约束提供了更有效的理论保证和实践指导。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 提出基于约束缩减的MILP模型简化方法，通过识别关键紧约束并转为等式约束来加速求解，相比现有方法提升解质量50%以上，减少计算时间17.47%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型简化方法主要基于变量缩减，而约束缩减这一对偶视角被忽视。约束缩减通过将不等式约束转为等式约束也能降低MILP复杂度，但面临识别关键约束和高效预测的挑战

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键子集；提出多模态表示技术，利用实例级和抽象级MILP表述信息来学习关键紧约束

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进方法，本方法提升解质量超过50%，减少计算时间17.47%

Conclusion: 约束缩减是有效的MILP模型简化方法，多模态表示技术能有效学习关键约束，显著提升求解效率和解质量

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家(MoE)模型虽然通过激活参数子集实现了高效性，但在推理过程中存在高内存访问成本的问题。之前的内存层架构如UltraMem只能匹配2专家MoE模型的性能，无法达到最先进的8专家配置水平。

Method: 提出了五项关键改进：1) 在每个transformer块中集成内存层；2) 使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3) 采用基于FFN的值处理；4) 实施原则性参数初始化；5) 重新平衡内存到FFN的计算比率。

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数条件下实现了与8专家MoE模型的性能相当，但内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现突出：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。验证了激活密度比总稀疏参数数量对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到了与最先进MoE模型相当的性能水平，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了治理即服务(GaaS)架构，通过模块化、声明式规则和信任评分机制，为分布式AI系统提供可缩放、可审计的运行时监管方案，无需修改模型内部结构或代理协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，现有监管机制存在反应式、脆弱、难以测试和涉多部署环境无法通用等结构性风险。

Method: 设计了基于声明式规则和信任因子机制的GaaS层，支持强制性、规范性和适应性干预，通过三个模拟测试模式（无监管、GaaS执行、对抗性测试）评估性能。

Result: 在LLaMA3、Qwen3、DeepSeek-R1等模型的内容生成和金融决策场景中，GaaS能够可靠阻截或重定向高风险行为，同时保持吞吐量，信任评分有效跟踪规则遵守情况。

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为运行时服务，为互操作代理生态系统建立基础设施级别的对齐机制，实现"不教育代理道德而是强制执行"的监管方式。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: 本文研究联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公开标签和私有标签设置对模型性能的影响，提出了标准联邦学习方法的适应性改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中客户端标签集异构性很常见但研究较少，特别是当标签集仅与中央服务器共享的私有设置时，学习算法面临更多约束，这是一个更困难的问题。

Method: 应用分类器组合问题的经典方法到联邦学习，通过集中调优调整客户端模型表示对齐，并针对私有标签集设置调整常见的联邦学习方法。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。集中调优可以帮助缓解这个问题，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准联邦学习方法适应性改进在私有标签设置中表现良好，性能与标准方法在公开设置中相当。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型准确性的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，标准联邦学习方法的适应性改进在私有标签设置中表现优异。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗等敏感领域存在偏见问题，现有去偏方法需要原始训练数据、大量重训练，且在公平性和性能之间存在权衡。

Method: 首先识别模型参数对偏见和预测性能的相对贡献，然后通过两步微调过程，根据参数贡献定义不同的梯度流来更新每个参数。

Result: 在三个偏见敏感属性（性别、肤色、年龄）和六个医疗数据集上的实验表明，SWiFT能持续减少模型偏见，在公平性和准确性指标上达到或超越最先进方法，并展现出更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的去偏解决方案，能够在保持模型性能的同时显著提升公平性，特别适用于数据访问受限的现实场景。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conclusion: 深度强化学习能够有效提升恶意软件检测性能和对概念漂移的抵御能力，在动态的Android恶意软件环境中表现出优异的长期稳定性。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Method: 算法每次推荐一个物品，用户消费后将其与历史消费物品进行比较。通过初始随机探索阶段积累丰富历史，利用矩阵集中界限证明理论保证。

Result: 理论分析显示算法可实现O(√T)的遗憾上界，模拟实验表明重用历史物品进行比较比仅比较同时推荐物品能显著降低遗憾。

Conclusion: 通过利用用户历史消费物品进行比较查询的新模型，能够在不需要额外遗憾成本的情况下获得更好的性能表现。

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Method: HAEPO将轨迹压缩为累积对数概率，使用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，并加入熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明HAEPO收敛快、探索充分、与真实奖励对齐紧密，在多样化任务中表现优于或等同于PPO、GRPO和DPO。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time
series research and applications.

Motivation: 标准神经过程依赖全局潜在变量，在不确定性校准和捕捉局部数据依赖方面存在困难，需要更好的建模方法

Method: 引入全局潜在变量建模任务级变化，局部潜在变量捕捉输入相似性，通过bi-Lipschitz正则化保持距离关系

Result: DNP在回归和分类任务中实现了更强的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准

Conclusion: 距离感知的局部潜在结构与全局结构的结合有效提升了神经过程的不确定性估计能力

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 这是首次为具有一般非线性动态的神经ODE推导泛化边界，为这类连续深度模型的泛化性能提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose

cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture
temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates
ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

Motivation: 多标签数据分析需要先检验标签依赖性，但现有方法在估计条件协方差时存在可靠性问题，需要比较不同模型的性能。

Method: 通过实验比较三种模型（多元Probit、多元Bernoulli和分阶段Logit）在测量常数协方差和依赖协方差方面的表现。

Result: 所有模型都能很好地测量常数和依赖协方差，但都会错误地将常数协方差检测为依赖协方差。多元Probit模型的错误率最低。

Conclusion: 虽然三种模型在协方差测量方面表现相似，但都存在误检问题，其中多元Probit模型是最可靠的选择。

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Motivation: 研究Koopman表示在混沌动力系统中的通用性和跨任务迁移能力，为物理信息机器学习中的多任务学习提供基础表示。

Method: 提出三阶段方法：1)通过自编码学习Koopman嵌入；2)在下一状态预测上预训练transformer；3)针对安全关键控制进行微调。使用Lorenz系统作为测试平台。

Result: Koopman嵌入优于标准和物理信息PCA基线，实现准确且数据高效的性能。微调时固定预训练权重不会导致性能下降，表明学习到的表示捕获了可重用的动力学结构。

Conclusion: Koopman嵌入可作为物理信息机器学习中多任务学习的基础表示，其学习到的表示能够捕获通用的动力学结构而非任务特定模式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAX-TS是一种模型无关的后处理算法，用于解释时间序列预测模型及其预测结果，通过局部输入扰动生成多粒度解释，并能表征多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代预测模型通常不透明且不提供预测解释，而现有的后处理可解释性方法（如LIME）不适用于预测场景，因此需要专门的时间序列预测解释方法。

Method: 基于局部输入扰动的模型无关后处理算法，通过扰动输入时间序列来生成多粒度解释，能够处理多元时间序列的跨通道相关性。

Result: 在7种算法和10个不同数据集上的基准测试表明，PAX-TS能有效捕捉模型行为，高表现和低表现算法的解释存在差异，并识别出6类重复出现的模式，这些模式是性能的指标。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为时间序列预测提供了有效的可解释性工具。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDiff是一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的工业时间序列缺失值填补方法，通过逐步生成缺失值并考虑系统动态和控制输入，在长间隔缺失情况下表现优于传统窗口方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法假设固定时间窗口内的模式完成，但在工业系统中，动态受控制动作驱动、高度非平稳且可能存在长时间连续缺失，这种方法往往失效。

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，具有与控制理论一致的自回归偏置，基于最近已知状态和相关控制或环境输入逐步生成缺失值。

Result: 在污水处理数据集上，STDiff始终实现最低误差，且在更长缺失间隔时优势更明显；在原始工业数据集上，能产生动态合理的轨迹，而基于窗口的模型往往过度平滑。

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件化的填补方法作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，并讨论了计算权衡和向更广泛领域的扩展。

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Conclusion: 这个简单模型从物理角度提供了对学习系统的新见解，帮助我们更好地理解学习的本质和限制。

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Motivation: 现有预测过程监控研究主要关注控制流视角，而资源信息在下一个活动预测中的作用尚未探索。资源中心视角可以提供更好的工作组织、负载平衡和容量预测等额外优势。

Method: 使用四种预测模型（LightGBM、Transformer、Random Forest等）和三种编码策略（2-gram活动转移、活动重复特征、以及两者的组合），在四个真实数据集上进行评估。

Result: 相比基线，LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最好，Random Forest在组合编码中获益最多。组合编码实现了最高的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源中心的下一个活动预测方法为智能资源分配、战略人力规划和个性化员工支持提供了新途径，为预测过程监控研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source

TL;DR: 这篇论文深入分析了现代重复模型(如SSM)与Transformer在联想回忆(AR)任务上的性能差异，揭示了学习率选择、网络深度与宽度扩缩对不同模型的关键影响，以及单层Transformer训练动态的意外发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别现代重复模型(如状态空间模型SSM)虽有次二阶复杂度优势，但在推理和记忆任务上可能存在短板，特别是在联想回忆任务上的表现差异需要更深入研究。

Method: 通过系统性实验分析了学习率选择、网络深度与宽度扩缩对模型性能的影响，对比了Transformer和Mamba等模型的表现，并通过结构消融实验研究了各组件对性能和训练稳定性的影响。

Result: 发现重复模型对学习率选择极为敏感，这可能影响以往研究的性能报告；注意力模型在单层配置下无法解决AR任务；单层Transformer虽表玹差但训练动态却呈现出引导头形成特征。

Conclusion: 现代重复模型需要更好的训练稳定性研究，不同模型在网络扩缩方向上存在明显差异，单层Transformer的意外训练现象为理解模型学习机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GNN在训练域外（如更大或结构不同的图）的泛化能力，以及其超越传统近似角色、用于生成数值格式的潜力

Method: 使用符号回归分析GNN学到的表示，在仅有双节点图的数据集上训练GNN，并在无监督设置下使用类似PINN的残差损失

Result: GNN能够外推出一阶有限体积格式，误差为O(ε)；2跳和2层GNN分别自主发现了二阶修正项和经典二阶中点格式

Conclusion: GNN不仅是强大的近似器，还可以作为开发新型数值方法的积极贡献者，这符合科学计算的新范式

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规要求从深度学习模型中删除数据，这在联邦学习中尤为困难，因为数据保留在客户端，完全重新训练或协调更新通常不可行

Method: 使用二阶Hessian信息识别对要遗忘数据最敏感的模型参数，选择性重置这些参数，然后进行最小化的联邦重新训练

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出强大的隐私保护能力（MIA攻击成功率接近随机猜测，类别知识被有效擦除）和高性能（相对于重新训练基准的归一化准确率约为0.9），在针对性后门攻击场景中有效中和恶意触发器

Conclusion: 为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持高性能的同时实现了高效的隐私保护

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角剖分方法有效解决了GNN的拓扑限制问题，为图重布线提供了新的有效解决方案，在多个基准测试中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Motivation: 大语言模型的计算需求巨大，限制了部署和实时性能。现有量化方法在GPU上支持不足，存在Tensor Core支持有限、内存管理低效和内核优化不灵活等问题。

Method: 提出APT-LLM方案：1）双极INT数据格式实现高效无损转换；2）位级矩阵分解重组方法支持任意精度；3）基于数据恢复的内存管理系统；4）动态内核映射优化。

Result: 在LLM推理中，APT-LLM相比FP16基线最高实现3.99倍加速，相比NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4加速最高实现2.16倍加速。在不同GPU平台上均表现出显著性能优势。

Conclusion: APT-LLM有效解决了超低位量化LLM在GPU上的计算效率问题，为任意精度大语言模型的高效部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Conclusion: 该研究为密集关联记忆模型提供了理论基础和实用算法，证明了小规模DAM的权重对应于大规模DAM的不稳定鞍点，为高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

Conclusion: 模糊感知序数表示框架能够有效建模情感标注的模糊性和情感轨迹的动态特性，特别是在捕捉相对变化方面表现出色，为连续情感识别提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

Motivation: 虽然工具集成的大语言模型显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为什么这种范式有效的理论原理。本文旨在填补这一空白，为TIR的成功提供首个原则性解释。

Method: 提出了优势塑造策略优化(ASPO)算法，直接修改优势函数来指导策略行为而不影响训练稳定性。在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行综合实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上显著优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题。ASPO改善了工具使用行为，实现了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 工具集成推理从根本上扩展了LLM的能力边界，打破了纯文本模型的能力天花板。本文提供了TIR成功的首个理论解释，将关注点从工具是否有效转向了为什么和如何实现更强大的推理。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

<details>

Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，因为精确预测未来token过于困难

Method: 提出TOP方法，使用学习排序损失训练模型根据邻近度对即将到来的token进行排序，相比MTP只需要一个额外的unembedding层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数规模的模型预训练中，TOP在8个标准NLP基准测试中整体优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP是一种更有效的辅助训练目标，通过降低预测难度（从精确token预测到相对顺序预测）来提升语言模型性能

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is

Motivation: 单个大语言模型各有优劣，无法在所有领域都表现优异，需要利用多个模型的集体智慧来克服个体弱点

Method: 将LLM作为对等网络节点，采用类似八卦协议的机制交换答案和思考过程，逐步达成共识决策

Conclusion: 这种基于八卦协议的共识方法使AI推理更加协作和可信，类似于人类建立共识的过程，超越了黑盒程序的局限性

Abstract: Large language models have advanced rapidly, but no single model excels in
every area -- each has its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of relying on one
model alone, we take inspiration from gossip protocols in distributed systems,
where information is exchanged with peers until they all come to an agreement.
In this setup, models exchange answers and gradually work toward a shared
solution. Each LLM acts as a node in a peer-to-peer network, sharing responses
and thought processes to reach a collective decision. Our results show that
this "gossip-based consensus" leads to robust, resilient, and accurate
multi-agent AI reasoning. It helps overcome the weaknesses of individual models
and brings out their collective strengths. This approach is similar to how
humans build consensus, making AI seem more collaborative and trustworthy
instead of just a black-box program.

### [259] [Murakkab: Resource-Efficient Agentic Workflow Orchestration in Cloud Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18298)
*Gohar Irfan Chaudhry,Esha Choukse,Haoran Qiu,Íñigo Goiri,Rodrigo Fonseca,Adam Belay,Ricardo Bianchini*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: Murakkab是一个用于agentic workflows的高效服务系统，通过声明式抽象解耦工作流规范和执行配置，实现跨层优化，显著降低GPU使用、能耗和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前agentic workflows服务效率低下，工作流组件分散在不同实体中，无法在准确性、延迟、能耗和成本之间进行权衡优化，导致资源浪费和服务质量下降。

Method: 引入声明式抽象将工作流规范与执行配置解耦，采用profile-guided优化器和自适应运行时共同管理全栈，包括编排工作流组件、映射到模型和硬件，以及动态重新配置执行以满足用户定义的SLO。

Result: 评估显示，Murakkab将GPU使用减少2.8倍，能耗降低3.7倍，成本减少4.3倍，同时保持SLO。

Conclusion: Murakkab通过暴露agentic workflows的内部结构，实现了现有框架和云调度器无法达到的跨层优化，显著提升了资源效率和服务质量。

Abstract: Agentic workflows commonly coordinate multiple models and tools with complex
control logic. They are quickly becoming the dominant paradigm for AI
applications. However, serving them remains inefficient with today's
frameworks. The key problem is that they expose workflows as opaque sequences
of model and tool calls that tightly couple agent logic with model and hardware
choices. Often, these workflow components are fragmented across different
entities, preventing systems from reasoning about trade-offs across accuracy,
latency, energy, and cost. This leads to resource waste and degraded
service-level objectives (SLOs).
  We present Murakkab, a resource-efficient serving system for agentic
workflows. Murakkab introduces a declarative abstraction that decouples
workflow specification from execution configuration. A profile-guided optimizer
and adaptive runtime jointly manage the full stack: orchestrating workflow
components, mapping them to models and hardware, and dynamically reconfiguring
execution to satisfy user-defined SLOs. By exposing the internal structure of
agentic workflows, Murakkab enables cross-layer optimization that existing
frameworks and cloud schedulers cannot achieve.
  Our evaluation on diverse workflows shows that \sysname{} reduces GPU usage
by up to 2.8$\times$, energy consumption by 3.7$\times$, and cost by
4.3$\times$ while maintaining SLOs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育中学生主动学习、跟踪进展和调整策略的挑战，利用AI技术创建结构化支持环境。

Result: 在大学和中学设置中进行案例研究，证明框架在不同领域都具有适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架为推进AI驱动学习环境提供了新方向，并提出了未来研究路径。

Abstract: One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future
directions for advancing AI-driven learning environments.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了FairSkillMARL框架，将公平性定义为工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重目标，并开发了MARLHospital医疗环境来研究异构多智能体系统中的公平性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL公平性研究主要关注工作量平衡，忽略了智能体专业技能的差异和现实领域所需的结构化协调，特别是在医疗保健等领域需要防止过度使用高技能人员和任务技能不匹配问题。

Method: 提出FairSkillMARL框架，结合工作量平衡和技能任务对齐的双重公平目标；开发MARLHospital可定制医疗环境，模拟团队组成和能量约束调度对公平性的影响；与四种标准MARL方法和两种最先进公平指标进行比较实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，仅基于相等工作量的公平性可能导致任务技能不匹配，需要更强大的指标来捕捉技能任务不对齐问题。

Conclusion: 该研究为研究异构多智能体系统中公平性提供了工具和基础，其中将努力与专业知识对齐至关重要，强调了需要同时考虑工作量平衡和技能匹配的公平性度量方法。

Abstract: Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a
workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured
coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task
allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout
and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing
an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare
workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address
this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines
fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment.
Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired
environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling
impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this
problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with
four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics.
Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to
task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that
capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for
studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort
with expertise is critical.

Method: 建立考虑CAV存在与否的交通密度演化方程，构建分布式协调控制框架，采用邻居智能体运动学信息和顺序求解机制，引入基于控制序列评估的自适应截断滚动方案

Conclusion: 该方法具有强实时性能和可扩展性，展现出实际部署的潜力，为混合自动驾驶环境下的高效交通协调提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offers
substantial opportunities to enhance traffic efficiency. However, in mixed
autonomy environments where CAVs coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs),
achieving efficient coordination among CAVs remains challenging due to
heterogeneous driving behaviors. To address this, this paper proposes a
multiagent truncated rollout approach that enhances CAV speed coordination to
improve highway throughput while reducing computational overhead. In this
approach, a traffic density evolution equation is formulated that
comprehensively accounts for the presence or absence of CAVs, and a distributed
coordination control framework is established accordingly. By incorporating
kinematic information from neighbor agents and employing an agent-by-agent
sequential solution mechanism, our method enables explicit cooperation among
CAVs. Furthermore, we introduce a truncated rollout scheme that adaptively
shortens the optimization horizon based on the evaluation of control sequences.
This significantly reduces the time complexity, thereby improving real-time
performance and scalability. Theoretical analysis provides rigorous guarantees
on the stability and performance improvement of the system. Simulations
conducted on real-world bottleneck scenarios demonstrate that, in large-scale
mixed traffic flows, the proposed method outperforms conventional model
predictive control methods by reducing both the average travel time in the
bottleneck area and overall computational time, highlighting its strong
potential for practical deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文通过系统性比较研究，提出了针对自动驾驶离线强化学习中数据不平衡问题的数据筛选策略，发现基于模型不确定性的数据驱动方法能显著提升安全性，碰撞率降低近三倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习在自动驾驶规划中面临极端数据不平衡问题，普通场景远多于罕见的长尾事件，导致标准均匀采样方法产生脆弱且不安全的策略。

Method: 研究了六种关键性加权方案，分为三类：启发式、不确定性和行为基础方法，在两个时间尺度（单时间步和完整场景）上评估，使用目标条件保守Q学习和注意力架构训练七个智能体。

Result: 所有数据筛选方法均显著优于基线，基于模型不确定性的方法安全性提升最显著，碰撞率从16.0%降至5.5%。时间步级加权在反应安全性方面表现优异，场景级加权改善长时程规划。

Conclusion: 研究为离线强化学习中的数据筛选提供了全面框架，证明智能非均匀采样是构建安全可靠自动驾驶系统的关键组成部分。

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a
ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and
challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in
the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to
plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths.
Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational
complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In
this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the
problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is
combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic
filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the
different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description,
founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For
path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that
allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning
time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable
prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However,
the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as
highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in
SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these
issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots
by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning
enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events.
By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic
environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance.
This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using
neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights
from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models,
we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time
scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics
for advancements in autonomous systems.

Motivation: 导航标志和地图在人类环境中广泛可用，但很少被机器人系统使用。本文旨在利用这些现成的导航辅助工具来实现机器人的全局定位。

Method: SignLoc首先从输入地图中提取导航图，然后使用概率观测模型将检测到的标志中的方向和位置线索与图进行匹配，在蒙特卡洛框架内实现鲁棒的拓扑语义定位。

Result: 在大型环境（大学校园、购物中心和医院综合体）中的实验结果表明，SignLoc在仅观察1-2个标志后就能可靠地定位机器人。

Conclusion: SignLoc证明了利用现成导航标志和公开地图实现机器人全局定位的有效性，为机器人导航提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely
available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.
Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a
global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the
robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap
(OSM) graphs -- without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a
navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic
observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected
signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte
Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part
of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental
results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one
to two signs.

Conclusion: DELIVER的模块化可扩展架构为语言引导的多机器人协调提供了有效解决方案，推动了网络物理系统集成的发展。

Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via
Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot
pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies
natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and
motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world
settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of
LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The
environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define
robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points
along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs
each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the
MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo
simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results
show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes
while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent
system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team
size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent
utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible
architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the
frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.

Abstract: We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that
can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated
whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By
abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them
with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace
(A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation
and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot
base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient
planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action
sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion
planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired
configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan
refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our
simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\%
higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real
robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven
types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii)
long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the
significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than
encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable
approach to complex robotic manipulation.

standard is the one defined in ISO 23247. Though not developed for automotive
systems, it is one of the few feasible starting points for automotive DTs. In
this work, we investigate the suitability of the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for developing automotive DTs. Through the case study of
developing an Adaptive Cruise Control DT for a 1/10\textsuperscript{th}-scale
autonomous vehicle, we identify some strengths and limitations of the reference
architecture and begin distilling future directions for researchers,
practitioners, and standard developers.

Abstract: As the embodiment gap between a robot and a human narrows, new opportunities
arise to leverage datasets of humans interacting with their surroundings for
robot learning. We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies
with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions.
Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot
end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints.
This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data
\emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the
predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,
while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely
bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which
limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern
human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can
work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large
margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute
for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code,

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

Motivation: 现有失败检测方法在真实场景中性能有限，需要更可靠的检测方法来触发安全操作模式、恢复策略或任务重规划

Method: 使用时空知识（机器人执行的动作和视野中的任务相关物体），提出数据增强方法对视频不同部分应用可变帧率

Result: 在ARMBench数据集上F1分数从77.9提升到80.0（无额外计算开销），测试时增强后进一步提升到81.4

Conclusion: 时空信息在失败检测中至关重要，建议未来研究进一步探索合适的启发式方法

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code
and annotations are available.

TL;DR: HyperTASR是一个基于超网络的框架，通过任务目标和执行阶段动态调制场景表示，显著提升机器人操作任务的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作策略学习通常使用任务无关的表征提取方法，无法模拟人类认知中的动态感知适应能力，需要开发能够根据任务上下文动态调整的表示学习方法。

Method: 提出超网络驱动框架，根据任务规范和进展状态动态生成表征转换参数，使表征在任务执行过程中能够上下文演进，同时保持与现有策略学习框架的架构兼容性。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境中的综合评估显示，该方法在不同表征范式下都取得了显著的性能提升，通过消融研究和注意力可视化确认了其选择性关注任务相关场景信息的能力。

Conclusion: HyperTASR通过建立任务上下文和状态依赖处理路径的计算分离，有效提升了学习效率和表征质量，更接近人类在操作任务中的自适应感知模式。

Abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene
representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features.
Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction,
failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human
cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates
scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase.
Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters
conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling
representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach
maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks
while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike
methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between
task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning
efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance
improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation
studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively
prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive
perception during manipulation tasks. The project website is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了REC方法改进基于偏好的强化学习，用于无人机特技飞行控制，通过集成奖励模型提高偏好建模和学习稳定性，在仿真和真实无人机上成功实现了多种特技动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要手动设计奖励函数，但对于特技飞行等复杂任务难以形式化目标。基于偏好的强化学习(PbRL)可以从人类偏好中学习，更适合捕捉主观风格化的运动质量。

Method: 在Preference PPO基础上提出Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC)方法，改进奖励学习目标，通过集成奖励模型提高偏好建模的准确性和学习稳定性。

Result: REC方法达到88.4%的成型奖励性能，显著优于标准Preference PPO的55.2%。成功将仿真训练的策略迁移到真实无人机，实现多种特技动作。手动设计奖励仅60.7%符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: PbRL能有效捕捉复杂的人类中心目标，REC方法显著提高了偏好建模和学习性能，在物理和仿真领域都表现出色，突显了手动设计奖励的局限性。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Abstract: Designing robotic systems to act autonomously in unforeseen environments is a
challenging task. This work presents a novel approach to use formal
verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system
properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of
the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we
contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the
full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for
quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with
off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both
in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and
in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we
successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case
that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware.
Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our
method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the
verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of
exponentially.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不确定性下保证视野安全，实现自适应控制力度分配，最小化不必要的相机运动同时保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Autonomous control of the laparoscope in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive
Surgery (MIS) has received considerable research interest due to its potential
to improve surgical safety. Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual
Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the
existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement
noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual
experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and
uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that
guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +
stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual
model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based
on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization
framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a
uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given
based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously
formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware
formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary
camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated
through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot
platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph
node dissection. Compared with baseline methods, the framework maintains
near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), reduces tracking e

Motivation: 无人机的高效安全导航对于作战支持、包裹投递和搜救行动等应用至关重要，需要一种能够在静态和动态环境中都能有效工作的路径规划算法。

Method: 采用椭圆切线交点法生成可行路径，为每个威胁生成两条子路径，基于启发式规则选择最优路线，并通过迭代优化直至到达目标。结合无人机运动学和动力学约束，使用基于二次贝塞尔曲线的改进平滑技术生成平滑高效路径。

Result: 实验结果显示，TIG算法在静态环境中能以0.01秒的起始时间生成最短路径，转弯角度更少，性能优于A*、PRM、RRT*、Tangent Graph和Static APPATT算法。在完全未知和部分已知环境中，TIG表现出高效的实时路径规划能力，优于APF和Dynamic APPATT算法。

Conclusion: TIG算法是一种高效、快速的无人机路径规划方法，在静态和动态环境中都表现出优越的性能，能够为无人机导航提供可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Abstract: Achieving both behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion
generation for humanoid robot remains an open challenge, further compounded by
the lack of cross-embodiment adaptability. To address this problem, we propose
HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that integrates robot state, goal poses,
and contextual situations to generate human-like behaviors, ensuring both
behavioral similarity and appropriateness, and eliminating structural
mismatches between motion generation and execution. To support this framework,
we construct HPose, a context-enriched dataset featuring fine-grained
situational annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bone scaling-based data
augmentation strategy that ensures millimeter-level compatibility across
heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial
platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity,
behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like
behavior execution across diverse humanoid robots.

TL;DR: 提出了NRTrans框架，通过机器人技能语言(RSL)和编译器验证机制，为LLM生成的机器人控制程序提供正确性保证和反馈式微调


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法直接让LLM从自然语言生成可执行程序，但由于LLM不一致性和任务复杂性，经常产生大量编程错误，特别是在轻量级LLM应用中效果不佳

Method: 提出机器人技能语言(RSL)抽象控制程序细节，构建RSL编译器和调试器验证LLM生成的程序并提供错误反馈，通过迭代优化直到程序通过验证

Result: 实验表明NRTrans在多种LLM和任务下优于现有方法，对轻量级LLM实现了高成功率

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM生成的程序提供正确性保证，显著提升了LLM驱动的机器人应用效果

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

Conclusion: ZeST方法为零样本地形可通行性预测提供了安全、经济高效且可扩展的解决方案，加速了先进导航系统的开发。

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art
methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

Conclusion: 样条参数化策略为鲁棒视觉引导运动控制提供了简单、有效且可解释的替代方案

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made

Conclusion: 方向信息的高效共享使DIT*在复杂规划问题中表现出优越性能，为路径规划提供了新的启发式方法

Abstract: Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the
starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning
algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to
guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally
efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting
nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based
planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,
resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized
vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that
selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated
direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows
the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence
faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems
in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with
various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is

(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物智能中核心知识和注意力机制的启发，旨在为自主机器人开发安全、可靠且可解释的实时多步规划方法，克服反应式智能体只能单步规划的局限性

Method: 开发了小型专用模型检查算法，采用链式临时控制系统应对环境扰动，使用新颖的2D LiDAR数据离散化方法，通过前向深度优先搜索进行多步规划

Result: 在死胡同和游乐场场景中验证了方法的有效性，经验结果和形式化证明表明该方法能够生成高效的多步避障计划，性能优于单步规划的反应式智能体

Conclusion: 该研究为自主车辆的安全可靠规划提供了教学案例，证明了模型检查技术可用于创建高效的实时多步避障规划系统

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AutoRing是一个基于模仿学习的自主眼内异物环操作框架，通过动态RCM校准和RCM-ACT架构解决运动缩放和RCM点变化带来的运动学不确定性，仅使用立体视觉和器械运动学数据即可完成精确操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有眼内异物取出机器人主要依赖手动遥操作，学习曲线陡峭，且存在运动缩放变化和RCM点变化导致的运动学不确定性挑战。

Method: 提出AutoRing模仿学习框架，整合动态RCM校准解决坐标系不一致问题，引入结合动作分块变换器和实时运动学校准的RCM-ACT架构，仅使用立体视觉数据和专家演示的器械运动学进行训练。

Result: 在未校准显微镜条件下实现端到端自主操作，成功完成环抓取和定位任务，无需显式深度感知。

Conclusion: 为开发能够执行复杂眼内手术的智能眼外科系统提供了可行框架。

Abstract: Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in
confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on
manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of
autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable
motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we
propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular
foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration
to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument
variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines
action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained
solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert
demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring
grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental
validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy
conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent
eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动生成任务特定、空间自适应动力学模型的方法，通过扩散模型预测不同区域所需的分辨率，在树操作任务中将规划速度提高一倍且性能损失很小


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维空间（如可变形物体）的高效规划需要计算上可处理且表达能力足够的动力学模型，任务性能取决于动力学模型、世界动力学、控制和任务需求之间的复杂相互作用

Method: 使用基于扩散的模型生成器根据起始和目标点云预测每个区域的分辨率，采用两阶段数据收集过程：先使用预测动力学作为先验优化分辨率，然后直接使用闭环性能优化

Result: 在树操作任务中，该方法将规划速度提高了一倍，相比全分辨率模型只有很小的性能下降

Conclusion: 这种方法为利用先前的规划和控制数据为新任务生成计算高效且表达能力足够的动力学模型提供了一条路径

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流VLA模型忽视时序上下文，难以处理长时程、时间依赖的任务。受人类工作记忆和海马体系统的启发，需要开发能够有效处理时序信息的机器人操作框架

Method: 提出Cognition-Memory-Action框架：使用预训练VLM编码观测为感知和认知token形成工作记忆，建立感知-认知记忆库存储细节和语义信息，通过检索、融合和更新机制，结合记忆条件扩散动作专家生成时序感知的动作序列

Result: 在三个机器人上的150+仿真和真实任务中表现优异：SimplerEnv-Bridge 71.9%、Fractal 72.7%、LIBERO-5 96.5%，均优于CogACT和pi-0基线，Bridge任务提升14.6%。真实世界12个任务达到84.0%成功率，长时程任务提升26%

Conclusion: MemoryVLA通过模拟人类记忆机制有效解决了机器人操作中的时序上下文问题，在长时程任务中展现出显著优势，为时序感知的机器人操作提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

TL;DR: 通过热词预检索模块(H-PRM)提升ASR系统的域特定词汇识别准确性，解决大规模热词识别率下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASR模型在处理大规模热词时识别率显著下降，需要提高域特定词汇的准确性

Method: 使用热词预检索模块(H-PRM)通过声学相似度度量识别最相关热词候选，支持插入式集成到传统模型和音频大语言模型

Result: 广泛测试验证H-PRM能够超过现有方法，显著提高热词后召回率(PRR)

Conclusion: H-PRM为ASR热词定制化提供了新方向，是一种灵活的插入式解决方案

Abstract: Hotword customization is crucial in ASR to enhance the accuracy of
domain-specific terms. It has been primarily driven by the advancements in
traditional models and Audio large language models (LLMs). However, existing
models often struggle with large-scale hotwords, as the recognition rate drops
dramatically with the number of hotwords increasing. In this paper, we
introduce a novel hotword customization system that utilizes a hotword
pre-retrieval module (H-PRM) to identify the most relevant hotword candidate by
measuring the acoustic similarity between the hotwords and the speech segment.
This plug-and-play solution can be easily integrated into traditional models
such as SeACo-Paraformer, significantly enhancing hotwords post-recall rate
(PRR). Additionally, we incorporate H-PRM into Audio LLMs through a
prompt-based approach, enabling seamless customization of hotwords. Extensive
testing validates that H-PRM can outperform existing methods, showing a new
direction for hotword customization in ASR.

Motivation: 解决在资源受限设备上嘈杂环境中准确实时单音高音估计的挑战，以及缺乏精确音高标注数据的问题

Method: 使用多样化语音、音乐和合成数据集进行训练，采用大量数据增强，并引入SpeechSynth合成语音数据集提供精确音高标注

Result: 在10dB信噪比下达到91.80%的谐波平均值，比CREPE提升12个百分点，参数量仅95,842个，CPU运行速度比CREPE快42倍

Conclusion: SwiftF0在保持计算效率的同时实现了最先进的单音高音估计性能，适合实时部署，并提供了开源基准测试框架

Abstract: Accurate and real-time monophonic pitch estimation in noisy conditions,
particularly on resource-constrained devices, remains an open challenge in
audio processing. We present \emph{SwiftF0}, a novel, lightweight neural model
that sets a new state-of-the-art for monophonic pitch estimation. Through
training on diverse speech, music, and synthetic datasets with extensive data
augmentation, SwiftF0 achieves robust generalization across acoustic domains
while maintaining computational efficiency. SwiftF0 achieves a 91.80\% harmonic
mean (HM) at 10 dB SNR, outperforming baselines like CREPE by over 12
percentage points and degrading by only 2.3 points from clean audio. SwiftF0
requires only 95,842 parameters and runs approximately 42x faster than CREPE on
CPU, making it ideal for efficient, real-time deployment. To address the
critical lack of perfectly accurate ground truth pitch in speech corpora (which
typically rely on algorithmic estimators or laryngograph signals), we introduce
\emph{SpeechSynth}. This synthetic speech dataset, generated by a phoneme-level
TTS model, provides exact, on-demand ground-truth pitch curves, enabling more
robust model training and evaluation. Furthermore, we propose a unified metric,
combining six complementary performance measures for comprehensive and reliable
pitch evaluation, and release an open-source pitch benchmark suite. A live demo

Motivation: 解决缪疾语音识别中困扰的严重程度变化和与正常语音的差异问题

Method: 采用多谈话者精调策略，同时在多个缪疾语音谈者数据上进行训练

Result: 实验结果显示多谈话者精调比单谈话者精调能够获得更低的词误率（最高降低13.15%）

Conclusion: 多谈话者精调策略通过广泛的病理特征学习提升了模型的通用性，减轻了过拟合问题，降低了对单个病人数据的依赖

Abstract: Dysarthric speech recognition faces challenges from severity variations and
disparities relative to normal speech. Conventional approaches individually
fine-tune ASR models pre-trained on normal speech per patient to prevent
feature conflicts. Counter-intuitively, experiments reveal that multi-speaker
fine-tuning (simultaneously on multiple dysarthric speakers) improves
recognition of individual speech patterns. This strategy enhances
generalization via broader pathological feature learning, mitigates
speaker-specific overfitting, reduces per-patient data dependence, and improves
target-speaker accuracy - achieving up to 13.15% lower WER versus
single-speaker fine-tuning.

Motivation: 语音匿名化旨在隐藏说话人身份但保留语音数据效用，然而残留的说话人线索仍然存在隐私风险，需要开发攻击者侧的方法来增强自动说话人验证系统的去匿名化能力。

Method: 提出SegReConcat方法：在单词级别分割匿名化语音，使用随机或基于相似性的策略重新排列片段以破坏长期上下文线索，然后将这些片段与原始话语拼接，使攻击者能从多角度学习源说话人特征。

Result: 在VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024框架下对7个匿名化系统进行评估，SegReConcat方法在5个系统中成功提高了去匿名化效果。

Conclusion: SegReConcat作为一种数据增强方法，能有效增强攻击者对匿名化语音的去匿名化能力，证明了通过破坏长期上下文线索可以更好地提取残留的说话人特征。

Abstract: Anonymization of voice seeks to conceal the identity of the speaker while
maintaining the utility of speech data. However, residual speaker cues often
persist, which pose privacy risks. We propose SegReConcat, a data augmentation
method for attacker-side enhancement of automatic speaker verification systems.
SegReConcat segments anonymized speech at the word level, rearranges segments
using random or similarity-based strategies to disrupt long-term contextual
cues, and concatenates them with the original utterance, allowing an attacker
to learn source speaker traits from multiple perspectives. The proposed method
has been evaluated in the VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge 2024 framework across
seven anonymization systems, SegReConcat improves de-anonymization on five out
of seven systems.

Motivation: 当前缺乏可扩展和通用的可执行运行时环境，限制了ML智能体的训练进展，需要开发能够提供可验证反馈的执行环境

Method: 开发CTF-Dojo大规模可执行运行时环境，包含658个容器化的CTF挑战；创建CTF-Forge自动化管道，将公开资源快速转换为可执行环境；使用执行验证的训练轨迹训练LLM智能体

Result: 在仅使用486个高质量训练轨迹的情况下，在InterCode-CTF、NYU CTF Bench和Cybench三个基准测试中获得最高11.6%的绝对性能提升；32B模型达到31.9% Pass@1，创下开源模型新纪录，媲美前沿商业模型

Conclusion: 执行基础训练信号对于推进高性能ML智能体至关重要，CTF-Dojo证明了无需依赖昂贵专有系统也能实现显著性能提升，为可执行智能体学习提供了有效基准

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities when
trained within executable runtime environments, notably excelling at software
engineering tasks through verified feedback loops. Yet, scalable and
generalizable execution-grounded environments remain scarce, limiting progress
in training more capable ML agents. We introduce CTF-Dojo, the first
large-scale executable runtime tailored for training LLMs with verifiable
feedback, featuring 658 fully functional Capture-The-Flag (CTF)-style
challenges containerized in Docker with guaranteed reproducibility. To enable
rapid scaling without manual intervention, we develop CTF-Forge, an automated
pipeline that transforms publicly available artifacts into ready-to-use
execution environments in minutes, eliminating weeks of expert configuration
traditionally required. We trained LLM-based agents on just 486 high-quality,
execution-verified trajectories from CTF-Dojo, achieving up to 11.6% absolute
gains over strong baselines across three competitive benchmarks: InterCode-CTF,
NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best-performing 32B model reaches 31.9% Pass@1,
establishing a new open-weight state-of-the-art that rivals frontier models
like DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Gemini-2.5-Flash. By framing CTF-style tasks as a
benchmark for executable-agent learning, CTF-Dojo demonstrates that
execution-grounded training signals are not only effective but pivotal in
advancing high-performance ML agents without dependence on costly proprietary
systems.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LaQual是一个自动化评估LLM应用质量的框架，通过分层分类、静态指标筛选和动态场景适应性评估三阶段方法，能有效识别高质量应用，实验显示其评分与人工判断高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM应用商店主要依赖用户活跃度和收藏等静态指标进行排名推荐，难以帮助用户高效找到高质量应用，需要更有效的质量评估方法。

Method: LaQual框架包含三个阶段：1）分层分类标记LLM应用以匹配不同场景；2）使用时加权用户参与度和功能能力指标等静态指标过滤低质量应用；3）进行动态场景适应性评估，由LLM生成场景特定的评估指标、评分规则和任务。

Result: 实验显示LaQual自动化评分与人工判断高度一致（法律咨询Spearman's rho=0.62，旅行规划rho=0.60），能减少66.7%-81.3%的候选应用。用户研究表明LaQual在决策信心、比较效率（5.45 vs 3.30）和评估报告价值感知（4.75 vs 2.25）方面显著优于基线系统。

Conclusion: LaQual提供了一个可扩展、客观且以用户为中心的解决方案，能够在实际使用场景中有效发现和推荐高质量的LLM应用。

Abstract: LLM app stores are quickly emerging as platforms that gather a wide range of
intelligent applications based on LLMs, giving users many choices for content
creation, coding support, education, and more. However, the current methods for
ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics
like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently
find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an
automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of
three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical
way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static
indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability
metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic,
scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific
evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment.
Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its
automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's
rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in
travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of
candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual
significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison
efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived
value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results
demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered
solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use
cases.

Motivation: 当前基准测试主要关注scratch coding，缺乏对代码代理在实际GitHub仓库工作流中解决复杂任务的评估，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含54个真实任务的基准测试，每个任务配有关联的代码仓库和自动化评估工具，提出alpha-value指标综合评估任务成功率、token成本和开发者薪资。

Result: 实验显示即使最佳系统(OpenHands+Claude 3.7)也只解决了48.15%的任务，超过一半的失败源于环境设置和依赖解析等基础步骤。

Conclusion: GitTaskBench揭示了代码代理在真实工作流中的挑战，强调了需要更强大的工作流管理和超时准备，推动向仓库感知的代码推理和执行发展。

Abstract: Beyond scratch coding, exploiting large-scale code repositories (e.g.,
GitHub) for practical tasks is vital in real-world software development, yet
current benchmarks rarely evaluate code agents in such authentic,
workflow-driven scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a
benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic
tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository
with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical
success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose
the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance,
which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer
salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with
multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task
solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude
3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of
failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and
dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow
management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we
aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning,
execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex,
end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at
https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.

Conclusion: 该算法能够有效地控制电磁形成飞行系统，确保遵循各项约束条件，为实际应用提供了可靠的控制方案。

Abstract: This article presents a feedback control algorithm for electromagnetic
formation flying with constraints on the satellites' states and control inputs.
The algorithm combines several key techniques. First, we use alternating
magnetic field forces to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair
of satellites in the formation. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation
system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes
are controlled in order to prescribe the time-averaged force between each pair
of satellites. Next, the desired time-averaged force is computed from a optimal
control that satisfies state constraints (i.e., no collisions and an upper
limit on intersatellite speeds) and input constraints (i.e., not exceeding
satellite's apparent power capability). The optimal time-averaged force is
computed using a single relaxed control barrier function that is obtained by
composing multiple control barrier functions that are designed to enforce each
state and input constraint. Finally, we demonstrate the satellite formation
control method in numerical simulations.

Motivation: 实际控制应用中测量和状态估计往往不完美，而现有鲁棒控制屏障函数方法对输入施加严格条件，导致过度保守性、不可行性和高控制代价等问题。

Method: 提出基于优化的在线参数自适应方案，通过泊松方程将多个安全约束合并为统一的数值CBF，并解决了车辆跟踪中典型的双相对阶问题。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比现有公式在整体性能上有显著改进，减少了保守性并提高了可行性。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统性改进方法有效解决了R-CBF的保守性问题，通过参数自适应和约束整合实现了更好的安全控制性能。

Abstract: Measurements and state estimates are often imperfect in control practice,
posing challenges for safety-critical applications, where safety guarantees
rely on accurate state information. In the presence of estimation errors,
several prior robust control barrier function (R-CBF) formulations have imposed
strict conditions on the input. These methods can be overly conservative and
can introduce issues such as infeasibility, high control effort, etc. This work
proposes a systematic method to improve R-CBFs, and demonstrates its advantages
on a tracked vehicle that navigates among multiple obstacles. A primary
contribution is a new optimization-based online parameter adaptation scheme
that reduces the conservativeness of existing R-CBFs. In order to reduce the
complexity of the parameter optimization, we merge several safety constraints
into one unified numerical CBF via Poisson's equation. We further address the
dual relative degree issue that typically causes difficulty in vehicle
tracking. Experimental trials demonstrate the overall performance improvement

TL;DR: 提出了FairMarket-RL框架，使用LLM批评器在P2P能源交易中塑造公平性感知的投标策略，通过三个公平性指标整合到奖励函数中，实现经济效率与社会公平的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有P2P能源交易市场和强化学习设计主要关注效率或私人利润，缺乏确保在不确定性下公平结果的实时指导，需要解决公平性问题。

Method: 提出公平感知多智能体强化学习框架FairMarket-RL，使用LLM批评器在连续双向拍卖中塑造投标策略，通过FTG、FBS、FPP三个公平性评分整合到奖励函数中。

Result: 框架促进了本地P2P交易，降低了消费者成本，保持了参与者间的强公平性，并保持了公用事业可行性，在不同实验规模下均表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为去中心化电力市场提供了一条可扩展的LLM引导路径，实现了经济高效、社会公平和技术可靠的平衡。

Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is becoming central to modern distribution
systems as rooftop PV and home energy management systems become pervasive, yet
most existing market and reinforcement learning designs emphasize efficiency or
private profit and offer little real-time guidance to ensure equitable outcomes
under uncertainty. To address this gap, a fairness-aware multiagent
reinforcement learning framework, FairMarket-RL, is proposed in which a large
language model (LLM) critic shapes bidding policies within a continuous double
auction under partial observability and discrete price-quantity actions. After
each trading slot, the LLM returns normalized fairness scores Fairness-to-Grid
(FTG), Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS), and Fairness-of-Pricing (FPP) that are
integrated into the reward via ramped coefficients and tunable scaling, so that
fairness guidance complements, rather than overwhelms, economic incentives. The
environment models realistic residential load and PV profiles and enforce hard
constraints on prices, physical feasibility, and policy-update stability.
Across a progression of experiments from a small pilot to a larger simulated
community and a mixed-asset real-world dataset, the framework shifts exchanges
toward local P2P trades, lowers consumer costs relative to grid-only
procurement, sustains strong fairness across participants, and preserves
utility viability. Sensitivity analyses over solar availability and aggregate
demand further indicate robust performance, suggesting a scalable, LLM-guided
pathway to decentralized electricity markets that are economically efficient,
socially equitable, and technically sound.

TL;DR: 这是一篇关于瑜伽个性化问题的视觉论文，提出了从感知到推荐的完整决策支持框架，并以阳光礼佛作为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 瑜伽练习包含大量复杂的动作和命令，个人需要根据自身需求选择适合的子集，调整练习内容并适应变化的环境和健康状况。现有系统缺乏完整的个性化支持。

Method: 提出了一种初步方法，结合多学科计算技术，包括姿势感知、推荐系统和动作纠正推荐。以Surya Namaskar（12个编排姿势）作为案例进行说明。

Result: 论文系统性地分析了瑜伽个性化面临的三大挑战：选择适合子集、持续关注调整、动态适应变化，并提出了解决方案的初步思路。

Conclusion: 这是首篇全面研究瑜伽个性化决策支持问题的论文，为多学科技术在健康领域的应用提供了新的研究视角和方向。

Abstract: Yoga is a discipline of physical postures, breathing techniques, and
meditative practices rooted in ancient Indian traditions, now embraced
worldwide for promoting overall well-being and inner balance. The practices are
a large set of items, our term for executable actions like physical poses or
breath exercises, to offer for a person's well-being. However, to get benefits
of Yoga tailored to a person's unique needs, a person needs to (a) discover
their subset from the large and seemingly complex set with inter-dependencies,
(b) continue to follow them with interest adjusted to their changing abilities
and near-term objectives, and (c) as appropriate, adapt to alternative items
based on changing environment and the person's health conditions. In this
vision paper, we describe the challenges for the Yoga personalization problem.
Next, we sketch a preliminary approach and use the experience to provide an
outlook on solving the challenging problem using existing and novel techniques
from a multidisciplinary computing perspective. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first paper that comprehensively examines decision support issues
around Yoga personalization, from pose sensing to recommendation of corrections
for a complete regimen, and illustrates with a case study of Surya Namaskar --
a set of 12 choreographed poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习分类器校准如何影响非专家人类用户的决策行为，探索校准是否能增强模型可靠性和采用率。

Method: 通过人机交互实验，比较标准校准和基于前景理论的修正校准方法对用户信任度和决策相关性的影响。

Result: 校准本身不足以提高人类决策与预测的相关性，前景理论修正对提高相关性至关重要，但直接询问的信任度不受方法影响。

Conclusion: 单纯的技术校准不够，需要结合行为经济学理论来优化人类与AI系统的交互效果。

Abstract: Calibration has been proposed as a way to enhance the reliability and
adoption of machine learning classifiers. We study a particular aspect of this
proposal: how does calibrating a classification model affect the decisions made
by non-expert humans consuming the model's predictions? We perform a
Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) experiment to ascertain the effect of
calibration on (i) trust in the model, and (ii) the correlation between
decisions and predictions. We also propose further corrections to the reported
calibrated scores based on Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory from
behavioral economics, and study the effect of these corrections on trust and
decision-making. We find that calibration is not sufficient on its own; the
prospect theory correction is crucial for increasing the correlation between
human decisions and the model's predictions. While this increased correlation
suggests higher trust in the model, responses to ``Do you trust the model
more?" are unaffected by the method used.

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了光学透明增强现实系统中不同透明度和工具可视化方式对深度感知和系统可用性的影响。结果显示不透明目标能提高深度估计准确性，而显示实际工具（遮挡虚拟目标）能带来最高的准确性和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光学透明增强现实系统在手术等臂长式指导中有应用潜力，但虚拟图像的深度感知和实际工具的遮挡问题仍面临挑战。需要研究不同可视化方式对深度感知和系统性能的影响。

Method: 在HoloLens 2上进行两个实验：实验1比较高透明度和低透明度目标渲染在深度匹配任务中的表现；实验2在6种可视化条件下（两种目标透明度×三种工具可视化模式）进行手术针点任务。收集深度匹配误差、目标定位误差、系统可用性、任务负荷和定性反馈数据。

Result: 不透明目标比高透明目标在臂长距离下有显著更低的深度估计误差。显示实际工具（遮挡虚拟目标）带来最高的准确性和可用性，而不跟踪工具表现最差。但高透明目标虽能保持实际工具可见性，却轻微损害深度线索并未改善可用性。

Conclusion: 正确的遮挡线索、将虚拟内容渲染为不透明并且被实际工具实时遮挡，对于OST-AR中的深度感知和精度至关重要。设计人员应优先考虑稳健的工具跟踪和遮挡处理；如果不可用，应慎重使用透明度来平衡深度感知和工具可视性。

Abstract: Optical see-through augmented reality (OST-AR) systems like Microsoft
HoloLens 2 hold promise for arm's distance guidance (e.g., surgery), but depth
perception of the hologram and occlusion of real instruments remain
challenging. We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with
different transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real
tool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten
participants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we
compared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth
matching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a
simulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six
visualization conditions ($2 \times 3$: two target transparencies and three
tool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool
tracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization
error, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show
that a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error
than a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real
tool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability
with the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst
performance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,
while allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues
and did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion
cues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real
time, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR. Designers of
arm-distance AR systems should prioritize robust tool tracking and occlusion
handling; if unavailable, cautiously use transparency to balance depth
perception and tool visibility.

TL;DR: 教学代理通过持续跟进问题促使学生从知识述说转向知识构建，知识构建在程序性知识和概念性知识的双向关系中起中介作用，帮助先前知识低的学生获得更高的学习收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在教学环境中常常只进行知识述说，而不能进行深度的知识构建活动，限制了学习效果。研究考察知识构建如何在程序性知识和概念性知识的双向关系中起中介作用。

Method: 使用能够提出持续跟进问题的教学代理，鼓励学生从知识述说转向知识构建，并分析知识构建在程序性知识和概念性知识双向关系中的中介作用。

Result: 发现程序性知识和概念性知识之间存在稳定的双向关系，进行知识构建的学生在后测中获得更高的分数，无论其先前知识水平如何。

Conclusion: 知识构建是连接先前知识低的学生与高级概念性和程序性知识学习收益的关键机制，在知识类型的双向关系中起重要中介作用。

Abstract: When adopting the role of a teacher in learning-by-teaching environments,
students often struggle to engage in knowledge-building activities, such as
providing explanations and addressing misconceptions. Instead, they frequently
default to knowledge-telling behaviors, where they simply dictate what they
already know or what to do without deeper reflection, thereby limiting
learning. Teachable agents, particularly those capable of posing persistent
follow-up questions, have been shown to encourage students (tutors) to shift
from knowledge-telling to knowledge-building and enhance tutor learning. Tutor
learning encompasses two interrelated types of knowledge: conceptual and
procedural knowledge. Research has established a bidirectional relationship
between these knowledge types, where improvements in one reinforce the other.
This study investigates the role of knowledge-building in mediating the
bidirectional relationship between procedural and conceptual learning. Our
findings revealed a stable bidirectional relationship between procedural and
conceptual knowledge, with higher post-test scores observed among students who
engaged in knowledge-building, regardless of their procedural and conceptual
pre-test performance. This suggests that knowledge-building serves as a crucial
mechanism bridging the gap between students with low prior knowledge and higher
conceptual and procedural learning gain.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究通过长期收集24名参与者的生理数据和自我报告情绪状态，发现生理特征与主观唤醒度之间的关系在数月内存在显著变化，表明情感计算模型需要定期更新以保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感计算和心理生理学通常假设生理特征与主观情感之间存在稳定关系，但这种假设很少在长时间范围内得到验证。本研究旨在探究这种关系在个体内是否在数月间保持一致性。

Method: 开发定制测量系统，在自然工作环境中收集24名参与者两个三个月期间的生理信号（血容量脉冲、皮电活动、皮肤温度、加速度）和自我报告情绪状态。使用可解释增强机（EBM）确保模型可解释性，分析生理-唤醒关系的时变特性。

Result: 基于第一期数据训练的模型在第二期数据上测试时准确率下降5%，表明生理-唤醒关联存在长期变异性。心率保持相对稳定的预测能力，而最小皮电活动在个体层面表现出显著的期间波动。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了考虑生理-唤醒关系时间变异性的必要性，建议情感估计模型应基于观察到的变化趋势定期更新（如每五个月），以维持长期稳健性能。

Abstract: Estimating emotional states from physiological signals is a central topic in
affective computing and psychophysiology. While many emotion estimation systems
implicitly assume a stable relationship between physiological features and
subjective affect, this assumption has rarely been tested over long timeframes.
This study investigates whether such relationships remain consistent across
several months within individuals. We developed a custom measurement system and
constructed a longitudinal dataset by collecting physiological signals --
including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature,
and acceleration--along with self-reported emotional states from 24
participants over two three-month periods. Data were collected in naturalistic
working environments, allowing analysis of the relationship between
physiological features and subjective arousal in everyday contexts. We examined
how physiological-arousal relationships evolve over time by using Explainable
Boosting Machines (EBMs) to ensure model interpretability. A model trained on
1st-period data showed a 5\% decrease in accuracy when tested on 2nd-period
data, indicating long-term variability in physiological-arousal associations.
EBM-based comparisons further revealed that while heart rate remained a
relatively stable predictor, minimum EDA exhibited substantial individual-level
fluctuations between periods. While the number of participants is limited,
these findings highlight the need to account for temporal variability in
physiological-arousal relationships and suggest that emotion estimation models
should be periodically updated -- e.g., every five months -- based on observed
shift trends to maintain robust performance over time.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型的用户界面存在局限性，采用僵化的线性交互范式，需要更创新的界面设计来提升用户体验

Method: 在设计思维工作坊中，参与者识别常见用例、评估现有界面优缺点，并创建可视化新交互概念，采用以人为中心的设计流程进行迭代开发

Result: 工作坊生成了强调灵活上下文管理、动态对话分支和增强用户控制机制的新界面概念，这些想法推动了白板式UI方法的进一步发展

Conclusion: 未来LLM界面开发应更加关注基于以用户为中心设计原则的UI创新，采用迭代式、用户导向的方法论进行持续改进

Abstract: Large Language Models have become widely adopted tools due to their versatile
capabilities, yet their user interfaces remain limited, often following rigid,
linear interaction paradigms. In this paper, we present insights from a design
thinking workshop held at the deRSE25 conference aiming at collaboratively
developing innovative user interface concepts for LLMs. During the workshop,
participants identified common use cases, evaluated the strengths and
shortcomings of current LLM interfaces, and created visualizations of new
interaction concepts emphasizing flexible context management, dynamic
conversation branching, and enhanced mechanisms for user control. We describe
how these participant-generated ideas advanced our own whiteboard-based UI
approach. The ongoing development of this interface is guided by the
human-centered design process - an iterative, user-focused methodology that
emphasizes continuous refinement through user feedback. Broader implications
for future LLM interface development are discussed, advocating for increased
attention to UI innovation grounded in user-centered design principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在模拟人类决策时存在固有偏见，与真实人类行为存在差异，限制了其反映人口层面多样性的能力。

Method: 采用基于人格特征的方法，利用行为经济学中的个体层面行为数据来调整模型偏见，特别是在最后通牒游戏中应用该方法。

Result: 在最后通牒游戏中观察到模拟行为与实证行为之间的改进对齐，特别是在响应者方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 虽然需要进一步完善特质表征，但人格条件化的大语言模型在规模化模拟类人决策模式方面展现出良好前景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human
decision-making, but their intrinsic biases often diverge from real human
behavior--limiting their ability to reflect population-level diversity. We
address this challenge with a persona-based approach that leverages
individual-level behavioral data from behavioral economics to adjust model
biases. Applying this method to the ultimatum game--a standard but difficult
benchmark for LLMs--we observe improved alignment between simulated and
empirical behavior, particularly on the responder side. While further
refinement of trait representations is needed, our results demonstrate the
promise of persona-conditioned LLMs for simulating human-like decision patterns
at scale.

<details>

Motivation: 在商品分配平台中，通过鼓励代理人放松某些限制可以提高整体社会福利，但需要确保这种建议不会损害原本就处于优势地位的代理人利益，同时平台可能面临预算约束。

Method: 提出了形式化的问题定义和参与保证层次结构，针对一对一和一对多分配设置开发了多项式时间算法来解决相关的优化问题，并在三个真实数据集上进行了广泛实验验证。

Result: 研究提供了有效的多项式算法来解决不同版本的优化问题，实验结果表明这种促进和放松机制能够带来显著效益，同时不同的参与保证机制会产生不同的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为分配平台提供了一种系统性的方法来通过鼓励限制放松提高社会福利，同时保护代理人利益，所提出的算法在实际应用中表现出良好的效果和可行性。

Abstract: We consider a setting where goods are allocated to agents by way of an
allocation platform (e.g., a matching platform). An ``allocation facilitator''
aims to increase the overall utility/social-good of the allocation by
encouraging (some of the) agents to relax (some of) their restrictions. At the
same time, the advice must not hurt agents who would otherwise be better off.
Additionally, the facilitator may be constrained by a ``bound'' (a.k.a.
`budget'), limiting the number and/or type of restrictions it may seek to
relax. We consider the facilitator's optimization problem of choosing an
optimal set of restrictions to request to relax under the aforementioned
constraints. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) We provide a formal
definition of the problem, including the participation guarantees to which the
facilitator should adhere. We define a hierarchy of participation guarantees
and also consider several social-good functions. (ii) We provide polynomial
algorithms for solving various versions of the associated optimization
problems, including one-to-one and many-to-one allocation settings. (iii) We
demonstrate the benefits of such facilitation and relaxation, and the
implications of the different participation guarantees, using extensive
experimentation on three real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号与文本图像差异大，存在高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接使用，且缺乏跨任务泛化和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，采用长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行高效表示学习。

Result: EMind在多个下游任务中表现出强大性能和广泛泛化能力，实现了从任务特定模型向统一电磁智能框架的转变。

Conclusion: 该模型成功建立了电磁信号基础模型框架，为动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域提供了有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Motivation: 无人机基站的非地面网络因其分布式和动态特性，极易受到安全攻击和恶意节点威胁

Method: 集成Hyperledger Fabric区块链与联邦学习，通过动态信任评分调整和能量感知共识机制，持续更新信任评级

Result: 实现94%的信任评分预测准确率和96%的恶意无人机检测率，在隐私保护、能效和可靠性方面优于集中式和静态基准方案

Conclusion: 该框架符合6G分布式智能和可持续性要求，是保障非地面网络安全的节能可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as
base stations are extremely susceptible to security attacks due to their
distributed and dynamic nature, which makes them vulnerable to rogue nodes. In
this paper, a new Dynamic Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism with Energy-Aware
Consensus (DTSAM-EAC) is proposed to enhance security in UAV-based NTNs. The
proposed framework integrates a permissioned Hyperledger Fabric blockchain with
Federated Learning (FL) to support privacy-preserving trust evaluation. Trust
ratings are updated continuously through weighted aggregation of past trust,
present behavior, and energy contribution, thus making the system adaptive to
changing network conditions. An energy-aware consensus mechanism prioritizes
UAVs with greater available energy for block validation, ensuring efficient use
of resources under resource-constrained environments. FL aggregation with
trust-weighting further increases the resilience of the global trust model.
Simulation results verify the designed framework achieves 94\% trust score
prediction accuracy and 96\% rogue UAV detection rate while outperforming
centralized and static baselines of trust-based solutions on privacy, energy
efficiency, and reliability. It complies with 6G requirements in terms of
distributed intelligence and sustainability and is an energy-efficient and
scalable solution to secure NTNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模表格数据集查询和分析的挑战，特别是对于缺乏SQL编程知识的用户。虽然Text-to-SQL方法在标准数据上表现不错，但继承了SQL的缺点：大数据集效率低下，并且不支持复杂数据分析功能。

Method: 提出一种新框架，在传统数据库外部实现，将自然语言查询转换为查询计划。利用LLM迭代地解释查询并构建操作序列，通过增量构建解决方案来处理计算复杂性。直接在数据上执行操作，避免了将整个数据集处理给模型的上下文长度限制。

Result: 通过在标准数据库和大规模科学表格上的实验验证，证明了该框架在处理大规模数据集和执行复杂数据分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架充分利用了LLM的能力，同时避免了SQL的限制，能够支持经典SQL命令和复杂分析功能（如主成分分析、异常检测），为大规模数据集查询和分析提供了更大的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

TL;DR: SISO是一个针对大语言模型服务的语义缓存系统，通过基于质心的缓存、局部感知替换和动态阈值技术，在严格的计算和内存约束下显著提高命中率和SLO达成率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统缓存策略（精确匹配和前缀缓存）忽略了查询语义，而现有的语义缓存系统缺乏概念创新，无法在严格的计算和内存约束下有效满足大语言模型服务的SLO要求。

Method: SISO采用三种核心技术：1）基于质心的缓存以最小内存实现最大覆盖；2）局部感知替换策略保留高价值条目；3）动态阈值技术在不同工作负载下平衡准确性和延迟。

Result: 在多样化数据集上，SISO相比最先进系统实现了最高1.71倍的命中率提升，并始终保持更强的SLO达成能力。

Conclusion: SISO通过重新定义LLM服务的效率标准，证明了语义缓存在大语言模型服务中的巨大潜力，为未来缓存系统设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.

TL;DR: 提出基于文本条件掩码扩散模型的新型对抗检测和净化框架MDD，无需对抗样本或大规模预训练，在对抗检测和语音净化方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 说话人验证系统在安全敏感应用中部署增多，但对对抗性扰动高度脆弱，需要有效的检测和净化方法

Method: 使用文本条件掩码扩散模型，对梅尔频谱图进行部分掩码并通过前向扩散过程逐步添加噪声，然后基于输入文本进行反向重建

Result: MDD实现了强大的对抗检测性能，优于包括扩散基和神经编解码基方法在内的现有技术，能有效净化对抗性操纵语音

Conclusion: 基于扩散的掩码策略在构建安全可靠的说话人验证系统方面具有巨大潜力

Abstract: Speaker verification systems are increasingly deployed in security-sensitive
applications but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. In this
work, we propose the Mask Diffusion Detector (MDD), a novel adversarial
detection and purification framework based on a \textit{text-conditioned masked
diffusion model}. During training, MDD applies partial masking to
Mel-spectrograms and progressively adds noise through a forward diffusion
process, simulating the degradation of clean speech features. A reverse process
then reconstructs the clean representation conditioned on the input
transcription. Unlike prior approaches, MDD does not require adversarial
examples or large-scale pretraining. Experimental results show that MDD
achieves strong adversarial detection performance and outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, including both diffusion-based and neural codec-based
approaches. Furthermore, MDD effectively purifies adversarially-manipulated
speech, restoring speaker verification performance to levels close to those
observed under clean conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of
diffusion-based masking strategies for secure and reliable speaker verification
systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 这篇范围维度文献综述调查了自动语音识别(ASR)技术中对非洲美国英语(AAE)讲者的公平性、偏见和公正问题，指出技术公平干预的不足并提出基于社区参与的治理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机来自于ASR系统在处理语言多样性社群(特别是AAE讲者)时存在的公平性和偏见问题，需要系统性地分析当前研究状况和找到更全面的解决方案。

Method: 研究采用范围维度文献综述方法，综合分析44篇同行审查文献，涵盖人机交互(HCI)、机器学习/自然语言处理(ML/NLP)和社会语言学领域，识别四个主要研究领域。

Result: 研究发现当前研究主要集中在四个方面：ASR相关害备的理解、包容性数据实践、语言包容性的方法论和理论、以及更公平系统的设计建议。虽然技术公平干预在增长，但缺乏重视社区主体性、语言正义和参与式负责制的治理导向方法。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一个治理为中心的ASR生命周期框架，作为跨学科负责任ASR开发的新兴框架，并为研究人员、实践者和政策制定者提供了应对语言边缘化问题的建议。

Abstract: This scoping literature review examines how fairness, bias, and equity are
conceptualized and operationalized in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and
adjacent speech and language technologies (SLT) for African American English
(AAE) speakers and other linguistically diverse communities. Drawing from 44
peer-reviewed publications across Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Machine
Learning/Natural Language Processing (ML/NLP), and Sociolinguistics, we
identify four major areas of inquiry: (1) how researchers understand
ASR-related harms; (2) inclusive data practices spanning collection, curation,
annotation, and model training; (3) methodological and theoretical approaches
to linguistic inclusion; and (4) emerging practices and design recommendations
for more equitable systems. While technical fairness interventions are growing,
our review highlights a critical gap in governance-centered approaches that
foreground community agency, linguistic justice, and participatory
accountability. We propose a governance-centered ASR lifecycle as an emergent
interdisciplinary framework for responsible ASR development and offer
implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to
address language marginalization in speech AI systems.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: EAI-Avatar是一个情感感知的双向对话头像生成框架，利用LLM的对话能力生成具有丰富情感变化和时间一致性的虚拟头像，支持说话和倾听状态的平滑转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多只关注单向肖像动画，少数支持双向对话交互的方法缺乏精确的情感适应能力，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计基于Transformer的头部掩码生成器学习潜在掩码空间中的时间一致运动特征，引入交互式对话树结构表示对话状态转换，通过反向层级遍历提取历史情感线索指导表情合成。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法具有优越的性能和有效性。

Conclusion: EAI-Avatar框架成功解决了双向对话中情感适应的问题，为情感感知的对话头像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models have advanced rapidly, enabling impressive talking head
generation that brings AI to life. However, most existing methods focus solely
on one-way portrait animation. Even the few that support bidirectional
conversational interactions lack precise emotion-adaptive capabilities,
significantly limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose
EAI-Avatar, a novel emotion-aware talking head generation framework for dyadic
interactions. Leveraging the dialogue generation capability of large language
models (LLMs, e.g., GPT-4), our method produces temporally consistent virtual
avatars with rich emotional variations that seamlessly transition between
speaking and listening states. Specifically, we design a Transformer-based head
mask generator that learns temporally consistent motion features in a latent
mask space, capable of generating arbitrary-length, temporally consistent mask
sequences to constrain head motions. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive
talking tree structure to represent dialogue state transitions, where each tree
node contains information such as child/parent/sibling nodes and the current
character's emotional state. By performing reverse-level traversal, we extract
rich historical emotional cues from the current node to guide expression
synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: INSIDE是一种通过在预训练说话人嵌入空间中进行球面线性插值来合成新说话人身份的数据扩展方法，用于解决说话人验证系统中数据收集困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习说话人验证系统的成功依赖于大规模多样化说话人数据，但收集更多身份的数据成本高、难度大且受隐私限制。

Method: 选择预训练说话人嵌入空间中相邻的说话人嵌入对，使用球面线性插值计算中间嵌入，然后通过文本转语音系统生成对应的语音波形，将合成数据与原始数据结合训练下游模型。

Result: 使用INSIDE扩展数据训练的模型优于仅使用真实数据的模型，相对改进3.06%到5.24%，在性别分类任务上也实现了13.44%的相对改进。

Conclusion: INSIDE是一种灵活、可扩展的数据增强方法，可与现有训练流程兼容，有效提升说话人验证和相关任务的性能。

Abstract: The success of deep learning-based speaker verification systems is largely
attributed to access to large-scale and diverse speaker identity data. However,
collecting data from more identities is expensive, challenging, and often
limited by privacy concerns. To address this limitation, we propose INSIDE
(Interpolating Speaker Identities in Embedding Space), a novel data expansion
method that synthesizes new speaker identities by interpolating between
existing speaker embeddings. Specifically, we select pairs of nearby speaker
embeddings from a pretrained speaker embedding space and compute intermediate
embeddings using spherical linear interpolation. These interpolated embeddings
are then fed to a text-to-speech system to generate corresponding speech
waveforms. The resulting data is combined with the original dataset to train
downstream models. Experiments show that models trained with INSIDE-expanded
data outperform those trained only on real data, achieving 3.06\% to 5.24\%
relative improvements. While INSIDE is primarily designed for speaker
verification, we also validate its effectiveness on gender classification,
where it yields a 13.44\% relative improvement. Moreover, INSIDE is compatible
with other augmentation techniques and can serve as a flexible, scalable
addition to existing training pipelines.

### [319] [Membership Inference Attacks on LLM-based Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18665)
*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文首次研究了基于大语言模型的推荐系统中的成员推理攻击威胁，设计了四种攻击方法并在真实数据集上验证了其有效性，特别是直接询问和投毒攻击表现出显著的高攻击优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的推荐系统使用包含用户敏感历史交互信息的提示进行上下文学习，这些隐私信息可能面临新型隐私攻击威胁，但此前缺乏相关研究。

Method: 设计了四种成员推理攻击方法：直接询问攻击、幻觉攻击、相似性攻击和投毒攻击，每种方法都利用了LLM或推荐系统的独特特性。在三个LLM模型和两个推荐系统基准数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 实验证实LLM推荐系统中的MIA威胁是真实存在的，直接询问和投毒攻击显示出显著高的攻击优势。分析了影响攻击效果的因素，如提示中的样本数量和受害者位置。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的推荐系统存在严重的隐私泄露风险，需要开发相应的防御机制来保护用户隐私数据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

### [320] [DenseRec: Revisiting Dense Content Embeddings for Sequential Transformer-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18442)
*Jan Malte Lichtenberg,Antonio De Candia,Matteo Ruffini*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DenseRec通过双路径嵌入方法，将稠密内容嵌入线性投影到ID嵌入空间，有效解决了Transformer推荐系统中的物品冷启动问题，在三个真实数据集上均优于ID-only基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于Transformer的顺序推荐系统（如SASRec、BERT4Rec）仅依赖物品ID嵌入，在面对动态物品目录时容易遭遇冷启动问题。虽然预训练模型的稠密内容嵌入提供了潜在解决方案，但直接集成到Transformer推荐器中表现一直不如纯ID方法。

Method: 提出DenseRec方法，采用双路径嵌入策略：在训练期间学习从稠密嵌入空间到ID嵌入空间的线性投影，使得模型能够无缝泛化到未见过的物品，无需专门的嵌入模型或复杂基础设施。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，DenseRec始终优于ID-only的SASRec基线，即使没有额外的超参数调优且使用紧凑的嵌入模型。分析显示改进主要来自在未见物品存在时更好的序列表示。

Conclusion: DenseRec为冷启动顺序推荐提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，通过简单的线性投影实现了内容嵌入的有效集成，解决了传统ID-only方法的冷启动局限性。

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的两阶段训练策略，通过对比领失预训练小模型来解决ID基嵌入的单时代过拟合问题，在Pinterest实现了显著的用户体验提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ID基嵌入在网络推荐系统中遇到的"单时代问题"，即因数据长尾分布导致过拟合而只能进行单时代训练，限制了模型性能

Method: 设计两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用对比领失进行最小模型的预训练，实现更广泛的数据覆盖；第二阶段将嵌入细调用于更复杂的下游推荐任务

Result: 离线实验证明预训练阶段的多时代训练不会导致过拟合，生成的嵌入在细调后提升了在线演化性能。在Pinterest实际部署中实现了全站范围内的显著用户体验增长

Conclusion: 该两阶段训练方法有效解决了ID基嵌入的过拟合问题，允许多时代训练且不损害演化性能，为大规模推荐系统提供了可行的性能优化方案

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

TL;DR: 通过游戏论案优化向量索引的软件缩压，在保持语义相似性的同时提升查询效率和存储效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 转换器嵌入的高维度特征导致向量相似性搜索系统的可扩展性和效率问题，需要一种方法在保留语义信息的同时减少冗余

Method: 采用游戏论案建模，将压缩策略形成一个棒杀游戏，在检索准确性和存储效率之间寻找最优平衡

Result: 与FAISS对比，方法在平均相似性(0.9981 vs 0.5517)和效用(0.8873 vs 0.5194)方面显著提升，虽然查询时间有些增加

Conclusion: 游戏论压缩方法在高效用的转换器基础搜索应用中具有实际价值，可无缝集成到现有LLM流程中

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

TL;DR: 提出了TRNO神经网络架构，用于温度相关的塑性响应建模，解决了传统GRU/LSTM模型训练时间长、时间分辨率依赖和外推能力差的问题，在镁合金多晶材料上实现了高精度预测和三个数量级的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络代理模型在计算力学本构关系中存在训练时间长、时间分辨率依赖、外推能力差的问题，且大多只能处理简单材料行为，需要开发更高效的架构来处理复杂温度相关的塑性响应。

Method: 提出了Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO)架构，这是一种时间分辨率无关的神经网络，专门用于建模多晶镁的温度依赖性塑性响应，该材料具有强塑性各向异性和热敏感性。

Result: TRNO在不同加载工况、温度和时间分辨率下都实现了高预测精度和良好泛化能力，在训练效率和预测性能上均优于传统GRU和LSTM模型，多尺度模拟速度比传统本构模型快至少三个数量级。

Conclusion: TRNO架构成功解决了传统循环神经网络在材料本构建模中的局限性，为复杂温度相关塑性行为的准确高效建模提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的工程应用价值。

Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性卒中病灶，通过共享深度中心无关表征来克服单中心数据不足和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中病灶分析存在高度变异性，传统计算方法仅从单一机构学习模式，缺乏泛化能力，且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 采用联邦平均(FedAvg)算法，从14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究中共享知识，构建深度中心无关表征的分割模型。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上达到DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26，优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法，在分布外中心也表现良好。

Conclusion: 联邦学习框架能够有效解决卒中病灶分割中的数据稀缺和泛化问题，展示了强大的跨中心泛化能力，为多中心医疗协作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Motivation: MRI采集耗时且昂贵，虽然已有加速MRI采集的研究，但对于分割等下游任务，完美重建可能并非必要。现有分割方法缺乏统一比较和评估标准，最优策略未知

Method: 比较7种方法，特别关注单阶段（重建+分割一体化）与两阶段（先重建后分割）方法的对比。使用两个包含多线圈k空间数据和人工标注分割真值的数据集进行测试

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂方法

Conclusion: 对于欠采样MRI数据的分割任务，简单的两阶段方法比复杂的单阶段专门方法更有效，这为临床实践提供了实用指导

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 基于RAW域的正式传播模型RDDM，直接从传感器RAW数据恢复照片实体图像，避免了传统sRGB域方法的限制，在保持高保真度的同时实现更现实的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域传播模型处理有损压sRGB输入，忽视了传感器RAW图像在边缘设备等场景中的可访问性，导致性能次优。RDDM目的是直接在RAW域恢复图像，替代传统的两阶段ISP+IR处理流程。

Method: 提出了三个核心组件：1）RAW域VAE（RVAE）学习最优惯性表征；2）可微分后调色处理（PTP）模块支持RAW和sRGB空间聚合优化；3）可配置多巴依尔（CMB）LoRA模块处理多样RAW格式。同时开发了可扩展的退化流程，从现有sRGB数据集合成RAW LQ-HQ对进行大规模训练。

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM在性能上超过了最先进的sRGB传播方法，能够产生更高保真度的结果，同时减少了人工效应。

Conclusion: RDDM通过直接在RAW域进行图像恢复，有效解决了sRGB域传播模型在高保真度和现实生成之间的困境，为边缘设备的图像和视频捕获提供了更优科的解决方案。

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

*Aneesh Rangnekar,Harini Veeraraghavan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RF-Deep是一个基于随机森林的分类器，利用预训练Transformer编码器的深度特征来检测OOD扫描并提高癌症分割的可靠性，在多个OOD数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在分布外(OOD)数据上分割性能下降的问题，提高癌症CT扫描分割的可靠性。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer编码器（通过SimMIM在10,432个未标记3D CT扫描上预训练）和卷积解码器构建分割模型，然后训练随机森林分类器利用深度特征检测OOD扫描。

Result: RF-Deep在肺栓塞、COVID-19和腹部CT数据集上的FPR95分别为18.26%、27.66%和小于0.1%，显著优于现有OOD检测方法。

Conclusion: RF-Deep提供了一种简单有效的方法来增强癌症分割在分布内和分布外场景中的可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed
tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer
treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised
pretraining can produce reliably accurate segmentation from in-distribution
(ID) data but degrade when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. We
address this challenge with RF-Deep, a random forest classifier that utilizes
deep features from a pretrained transformer encoder of the segmentation model
to detect OOD scans and enhance segmentation reliability. The segmentation
model comprises a Swin Transformer encoder, pretrained with masked image
modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans covering cancerous and
non-cancerous conditions, with a convolution decoder, trained to segment lung
cancers in 317 3D scans. Independent testing was performed on 603 3D CT public
datasets that included one ID dataset and four OOD datasets comprising chest
CTs with pulmonary embolism (PE) and COVID-19, and abdominal CTs with kidney
cancers and healthy volunteers. RF-Deep detected OOD cases with a FPR95 of
18.26%, 27.66%, and less than 0.1% on PE, COVID-19, and abdominal CTs,
consistently outperforming established OOD approaches. The RF-Deep classifier
provides a simple and effective approach to enhance reliability of cancer
segmentation in ID and OOD scenarios.

### [331] [Stress-testing cross-cancer generalizability of 3D nnU-Net for PET-CT tumor segmentation: multi-cohort evaluation with novel oesophageal and lung cancer datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18612)
*Soumen Ghosh,Christine Jestin Hannan,Rajat Vashistha,Parveen Kundu,Sandra Brosda,Lauren G. Aoude,James Lonie,Andrew Nathanson,Jessica Ng,Andrew P. Barbour,Viktor Vegh*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究首次在PET-CT上对nnU-Net进行跨癌症评估，使用两个新的全身体数据集（食管癌和肺癌），发现数据集多样性（多人口统计、多中心、多癌症整合）比架构创新更能驱动鲁棒泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床PET-CT工作流中，解剖部位、扫描仪和患者群体差异很大，需要深度学习肿瘤分割模型具备鲁棒泛化能力。

Method: 使用3D nnUNet模型在三种训练范式下进行实验：仅目标数据集（食管癌）、仅公共数据集（AutoPET）、以及组合训练。使用两个专家标注的全身体数据集（279例食管癌患者和54例肺癌患者）进行跨域性能测试。

Result: 仅食管癌模型在域内准确率最高（平均DSC 57.8），但在外部肺癌队列上失败（平均DSC <3.4）；仅公共数据集模型泛化更广但食管癌表现差；组合方法在所有队列中表现最平衡（肺癌52.9，食管癌40.7，AutoPET 60.9）。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性（多人口统计、多中心、多癌症整合）是临床鲁棒分割的基础，比模型复杂性更重要。组合训练方法能减少边界错误并提高跨队列鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust generalization is essential for deploying deep learning based tumor
segmentation in clinical PET-CT workflows, where anatomical sites, scanners,
and patient populations vary widely. This study presents the first cross cancer
evaluation of nnU-Net on PET-CT, introducing two novel, expert-annotated
whole-body datasets. 279 patients with oesophageal cancer (Australian cohort)
and 54 with lung cancer (Indian cohort). These cohorts complement the public
AutoPET dataset and enable systematic stress-testing of cross domain
performance. We trained and tested 3D nnUNet models under three paradigms.
Target only (oesophageal), public only (AutoPET), and combined training. For
the tested sets, the oesophageal only model achieved the best in-domain
accuracy (mean DSC, 57.8) but failed on external Indian lung cohort (mean DSC
less than 3.4), indicating severe overfitting. The public only model
generalized more broadly (mean DSC, 63.5 on AutoPET, 51.6 on Indian lung
cohort) but underperformed in oesophageal Australian cohort (mean DSC, 26.7).
The combined approach provided the most balanced results (mean DSC, lung
(52.9), oesophageal (40.7), AutoPET (60.9)), reducing boundary errors and
improving robustness across all cohorts. These findings demonstrate that
dataset diversity, particularly multi demographic, multi center and multi
cancer integration, outweighs architectural novelty as the key driver of robust
generalization. This work presents the demography based cross cancer deep
learning segmentation evaluation and highlights dataset diversity, rather than
model complexity, as the foundation for clinically robust segmentation.

### [332] [ModAn-MulSupCon: Modality-and Anatomy-Aware Multi-Label Supervised Contrastive Pretraining for Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18613)
*Eichi Takaya,Ryusei Inamori*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ModAn-MulSupCon是一种利用医学图像元数据（模态和解剖区域）进行多标签监督对比预训练的方法，在微调后在下游分类任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的大规模监督预训练受限于专家标注，而丰富的元数据（如模态和解剖区域信息）未被充分利用，需要开发能够利用这些元数据的预训练方法

Method: 将每张图像的模态和解剖信息编码为多热向量，使用ResNet-18编码器在miniRIN数据集上进行多标签监督对比学习，采用Jaccard加权的对比损失函数

Result: 微调后在ACL撕裂和甲状腺结节恶性分类任务上达到最佳AUC（0.964和0.763），在乳腺病变恶性分类上排名第二；但在冻结编码器的情况下，SimCLR/ImageNet表现更好

Conclusion: 利用现成的模态/解剖元数据作为多标签目标提供了一种实用、可扩展的预训练信号，在可微调的场景下能提高下游任务准确率，是标签稀缺临床环境的良好初始化方法

Abstract: Background and objective: Expert annotations limit large-scale supervised
pretraining in medical imaging, while ubiquitous metadata (modality, anatomical
region) remain underused. We introduce ModAn-MulSupCon, a modality- and
anatomy-aware multi-label supervised contrastive pretraining method that
leverages such metadata to learn transferable representations.
  Method: Each image's modality and anatomy are encoded as a multi-hot vector.
A ResNet-18 encoder is pretrained on a mini subset of RadImageNet (miniRIN,
16,222 images) with a Jaccard-weighted multi-label supervised contrastive loss,
and then evaluated by fine-tuning and linear probing on three binary
classification tasks--ACL tear (knee MRI), lesion malignancy (breast
ultrasound), and nodule malignancy (thyroid ultrasound).
  Result: With fine-tuning, ModAn-MulSupCon achieved the best AUC on MRNet-ACL
(0.964) and Thyroid (0.763), surpassing all baselines ($p<0.05$), and ranked
second on Breast (0.926) behind SimCLR (0.940; not significant). With the
encoder frozen, SimCLR/ImageNet were superior, indicating that ModAn-MulSupCon
representations benefit most from task adaptation rather than linear
separability.
  Conclusion: Encoding readily available modality/anatomy metadata as
multi-label targets provides a practical, scalable pretraining signal that
improves downstream accuracy when fine-tuning is feasible. ModAn-MulSupCon is a
strong initialization for label-scarce clinical settings, whereas
SimCLR/ImageNet remain preferable for frozen-encoder deployments.

a significant improvement over baseline object detection models. With a reduced
computational load and robustness under diverse environmental conditions,
HOTSPOT-YOLO offers a scalable and reliable solution for large-scale PV
inspections. This work highlights the integration of advanced AI techniques
with practical engineering applications, revolutionizing automated fault

*Zekun Ni,Jonathan Weyn,Hang Zhang,Yanfei Xiang,Jiang Bian,Weixin Jin,Kit Thambiratnam,Qi Zhang,Haiyu Dong,Hongyu Sun*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: Huracan是首个基于观测数据的端到端集合天气预报系统，在75.4%的变量和预报时效组合上达到或超越了ECMWF ENS的预报技能，仅使用较少观测数据即可媲美传统数值天气预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习天气预报模型仍依赖数值天气预报的初始条件，限制了其预报能力。已有端到端系统尚未达到最先进数值天气预报的水平。

Method: 结合集合数据同化模型和预报模型，仅使用观测数据作为输入，提供集合初始条件和端到端集合天气预报。

Result: 在75.4%的变量和预报时效组合上达到或超越了ECMWF ENS的连续排序概率评分，使用较少观测数据即可实现可比精度。

Conclusion: 这是端到端数据驱动天气预报的重大进展，为改进和革新业务天气预报开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: Over the past few years, machine learning-based data-driven weather
prediction has been transforming operational weather forecasting by providing
more accurate forecasts while using a mere fraction of computing power compared
to traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, those models still
rely on initial conditions from NWP, putting an upper limit on their forecast
abilities. A few end-to-end systems have since been proposed, but they have yet
to match the forecast skill of state-of-the-art NWP competitors. In this work,
we propose Huracan, an observation-driven weather forecasting system which
combines an ensemble data assimilation model with a forecast model to produce
highly accurate forecasts relying only on observations as inputs. Huracan is
not only the first to provide ensemble initial conditions and end-to-end
ensemble weather forecasts, but also the first end-to-end system to achieve an
accuracy comparable with that of ECMWF ENS, the state-of-the-art NWP
competitor, despite using a smaller amount of available observation data.
Notably, Huracan matches or exceeds the continuous ranked probability score of
ECMWF ENS on 75.4% of the variable and lead time combinations. Our work is a
major step forward in end-to-end data-driven weather prediction and opens up
opportunities for further improving and revolutionizing operational weather
forecasting.

TL;DR: LLMs在证明辅助工具中的验证能力研究：通过hs-to-coq和Verdi项目评估，发现外部依赖和上下文对证明生成有显著帮助，LLMs在小证明上表现良好但也会产生大证明，不同验证项目表现差异大，能生成简洁智能证明但也会犯奇怪错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在证明辅助工具中自动化证明生成的有效性，了解LLMs在实际验证项目中的表现和能力局限。

Method: 基于两个成熟的Rocq项目（hs-to-coq工具和Verdi）进行案例研究，通过定量和定性分析评估LLMs生成证明的效果。

Result: 研究发现：(1)外部依赖和同源文件上下文显著帮助证明生成；(2)LLMs在小证明上表现优秀但也能生成大证明；(3)不同验证项目表现差异明显；(4)能生成简洁智能证明并应用经典技术到新定义，但也会犯奇怪错误。

Conclusion: LLMs在证明辅助验证方面具有潜力，但效果受项目类型和上下文影响，既能生成高质量证明也存在特定错误模式，需要进一步研究其适用边界和改进方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can potentially help with verification using
proof assistants by automating proofs. However, it is unclear how effective
LLMs are in this task. In this paper, we perform a case study based on two
mature Rocq projects: the hs-to-coq tool and Verdi. We evaluate the
effectiveness of LLMs in generating proofs by both quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Our study finds that: (1) external dependencies and context in the
same source file can significantly help proof generation; (2) LLMs perform
great on small proofs but can also generate large proofs; (3) LLMs perform
differently on different verification projects; and (4) LLMs can generate
concise and smart proofs, apply classical techniques to new definitions, but
can also make odd mistakes.

*Lorenzo Beretta,Vincent Cohen-Addad,Rajesh Jayaram,Erik Waingarten*

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: 本文提出了从(1+ε)-近似最近对问题(CP)到(1+ε)-近似地球移动距离(EMD)的归约，改进了高维EMD的最快近似算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球移动距离(EMD)是计算两个点集之间完美匹配的最小成本，在机器学习和计算机视觉中有广泛应用。现有算法运行时间仍有改进空间

Method: 通过将EMD问题归约到最近对问题(CP)，并利用Multiplicative Weights Update框架的子线性实现，通过几何结构隐式执行权重更新

Result: 获得了运行时间为n^(2-Ω̃(ε^(1/3)))的(1+ε)-近似算法，优于之前最快的n^(2-Ω(ε^2))算法

Conclusion: 该归约方法显著提高了高维EMD近似算法的效率，技术贡献在于实现了无需显式计算权重的子线性MWU框架

Abstract: We give a reduction from $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) to $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate Closest Pair (CP). As a consequence, we
improve the fastest known approximation algorithm for high-dimensional EMD.
Here, given $p\in [1, 2]$ and two sets of $n$ points $X,Y \subseteq (\mathbb
R^d,\ell_p)$, their EMD is the minimum cost of a perfect matching between $X$
and $Y$, where the cost of matching two vectors is their $\ell_p$ distance.
Further, CP is the basic problem of finding a pair of points realizing $\min_{x
\in X, y\in Y} ||x-y||_p$. Our contribution is twofold: we show that if a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate CP can be computed in time $n^{2-\phi}$, then a
$1+O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to EMD can be computed in time
$n^{2-\Omega(\phi)}$; plugging in the fastest known algorithm for CP [Alman,
Chan, Williams FOCS'16], we obtain a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm
for EMD running in time $n^{2-\tilde{\Omega}(\varepsilon^{1/3})}$ for
high-dimensional point sets, which improves over the prior fastest running time
of $n^{2-\Omega(\varepsilon^2)}$ [Andoni, Zhang FOCS'23]. Our main technical
contribution is a sublinear implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update
framework for EMD. Specifically, we demonstrate that the updates can be
executed without ever explicitly computing or storing the weights; instead, we
exploit the underlying geometric structure to perform the updates implicitly.

Main category: stat.AP

TL;DR: 本研究探讨医疗数据共享中隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，识别易受隐私攻击的弱势群体，评估三种匿名化方法，发现MO-OBAM在保持最佳数据效用的同时提供最强隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据的二次使用对研究和临床创新至关重要，但引发了患者隐私担忧。需要平衡数据提供者和使用者的需求，特别是在保护弱势群体隐私的同时保持机器学习模型的性能。

Method: 使用2013-2015年成人住院患者数据集预测脓毒症，识别易受隐私攻击的弱势群体（老年人、频繁住院患者、少数族裔），评估k-匿名、Zheng等人方法和MO-OBAM三种匿名化方法在降低重识别风险和保持ML效用方面的表现。

Result: k-匿名提供有限保护，Zheng等人方法和MO-OBAM提供更强隐私保障，其中MO-OBAM效用最佳：与原始数据集相比，精确率和召回率仅变化2%。

Conclusion: 为医疗机构提供了负责任共享数据的可行见解，强调需要既能保护弱势群体又不牺牲数据驱动模型性能的匿名化方法。

Abstract: The secondary use of healthcare data is vital for research and clinical
innovation, but it raises concerns about patient privacy. This study
investigates how to balance privacy preservation and data utility in healthcare
data sharing, considering the perspectives of both data providers and data
users. Using a dataset of adult patients hospitalized between 2013 and 2015, we
predict whether sepsis was present at admission or developed during the
hospital stay. We identify sub-populations, such as older adults, frequently
hospitalized patients, and racial minorities, that are especially vulnerable to
privacy attacks due to their unique combinations of demographic and healthcare
utilization attributes. These groups are also critical for machine learning
(ML) model performance. We evaluate three anonymization methods-$k$-anonymity,
the technique by Zheng et al., and the MO-OBAM model-based on their ability to
reduce re-identification risk while maintaining ML utility. Results show that
$k$-anonymity offers limited protection. The methods of Zheng et al. and
MO-OBAM provide stronger privacy safeguards, with MO-OBAM yielding the best
utility outcomes: only a 2% change in precision and recall compared to the
original dataset. This work provides actionable insights for healthcare
organizations on how to share data responsibly. It highlights the need for
anonymization methods that protect vulnerable populations without sacrificing
the performance of data-driven models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"准生物"概念和"代理恐怖谷"框架，解释生成式AI在高效流畅与常识错误并存时引发的用户挫败感，并通过混合方法研究验证了AI效率感知与用户挫败感之间的负相关关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型生成式AI用户体验存在悖论：超人类的流畅性与荒谬的常识错误并存。这种强烈的挫败感源于AI作为"准生物"模拟智能却缺乏具身性和真正理解，导致用户在交互中产生认知失调。

Method: 采用混合方法研究（"Move 78"，N=37），通过协作创造性任务分析用户与生成式AI的交互体验，探究感知AI效率与用户挫败感之间的关系。

Result: 研究发现AI效率感知与用户挫败感存在强烈的负相关关系，当高效代理性的AI表现出不可靠行为时，用户舒适度显著下降，失败被感知为认知突破。

Conclusion: "代理恐怖谷"框架有力解释了用户对生成式AI的挫败感，对这类强大异类技术的设计、伦理和社会整合具有重要启示意义。

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了深度神经网络在预测金融收益概率分布方面的表现，使用CNN和LSTM架构预测三种概率分布的参数，在多个股票指数上表现优于传统GARCH模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统金融风险模型如GARCH在处理金融收益的厚尾和不对称性方面存在局限，需要探索深度学习模型作为替代方案来更准确地预测概率分布。

Method: 使用1D CNN和LSTM架构，通过自定义负对数似然损失函数直接优化正态分布、学生t分布和偏斜学生t分布的参数，在六个主要股票指数上进行测试。

Result: 深度学习模型提供了准确的分位数预测，在多个评估指标（LPS、CRPS、PIT）上表现优异，LSTM配合偏斜学生t分布在捕捉厚尾和不对称性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络是传统计量经济学模型在金融风险评估和投资组合管理中的可行替代方案，特别适合处理金融收益的复杂分布特征。

Abstract: This study evaluates deep neural networks for forecasting probability
distributions of financial returns. 1D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures are used to forecast parameters of
three probability distributions: Normal, Student's t, and skewed Student's t.
Using custom negative log-likelihood loss functions, distribution parameters
are optimized directly. The models are tested on six major equity indices (S\&P
500, BOVESPA, DAX, WIG, Nikkei 225, and KOSPI) using probabilistic evaluation
metrics including Log Predictive Score (LPS), Continuous Ranked Probability
Score (CRPS), and Probability Integral Transform (PIT). Results show that deep
learning models provide accurate distributional forecasts and perform
competitively with classical GARCH models for Value-at-Risk estimation. The
LSTM with skewed Student's t distribution performs best across multiple
evaluation criteria, capturing both heavy tails and asymmetry in financial
returns. This work shows that deep neural networks are viable alternatives to
traditional econometric models for financial risk assessment and portfolio
management.

Conclusion: VQT方法为量子计算中的端到端机器学习解锁了新颖架构，具有量子比特高效和减少经典采样开销的优势

Abstract: Vectorized quantum block encoding provides a way to embed classical data into
Hilbert space, offering a pathway for quantum models, such as Quantum
Transformers (QT), that replace classical self-attention with quantum circuit
simulations to operate more efficiently. Current QTs rely on deep parameterized
quantum circuits (PQCs), rendering them vulnerable to QPU noise, and thus
hindering their practical performance. In this paper, we propose the Vectorized
Quantum Transformer (VQT), a model that supports ideal masked attention matrix
computation through quantum approximation simulation and efficient training via
vectorized nonlinear quantum encoder, yielding shot-efficient and gradient-free
quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and reduced classical sampling overhead. In
addition, we demonstrate an accuracy comparison for IBM and IonQ in quantum
circuit simulation and competitive results in benchmarking natural language
processing tasks on IBM state-of-the-art and high-fidelity Kingston QPU. Our
noise intermediate-scale quantum friendly VQT approach unlocks a novel
architecture for end-to-end machine learning in quantum computing.

Abstract: As nature is ascribed as quantum, the fractals also pose some intriguing
appearance which is found in many micro and macro observable entities or
phenomena. Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble
the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability
density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various
energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such
as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite
its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces
incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in
chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using
the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image
generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a
Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit,
highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as
foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum
computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum
circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future
research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various
ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape
based on a quantum art theme.

Abstract: Analog quantum simulators with global control fields have emerged as powerful
platforms for exploring complex quantum phenomena. Recent breakthroughs, such
as the coherent control of thousands of atoms, highlight the growing potential
for quantum applications at scale. Despite these advances, a fundamental
theoretical question remains unresolved: to what extent can such systems
realize universal quantum dynamics under global control? Here we establish a
necessary and sufficient condition for universal quantum computation using only
global pulse control, proving that a broad class of analog quantum simulators
is, in fact, universal. We further extend this framework to fermionic and
bosonic systems, including modern platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical
superlattices. Crucially, to connect the theoretical possibility with
experimental reality, we introduce a new control technique into the experiment
- direct quantum optimal control. This method enables the synthesis of complex
effective Hamiltonians and allows us to incorporate realistic hardware
constraints. To show its practical power, we experimentally engineer three-body
interactions outside the blockade regime and demonstrate topological dynamics
on a Rydberg atom array. Using the new control framework, we overcome key
experimental challenges, including hardware limitations and atom position
fluctuations in the non-blockade regime, by identifying smooth, short-duration
pulses that achieve high-fidelity dynamics. Experimental measurements reveal
dynamical signatures of symmetry-protected-topological edge modes, confirming
both the expressivity and feasibility of our approach. Our work opens a new
avenue for quantum simulation beyond native hardware Hamiltonians, enabling the
engineering of effective multi-body interactions and advancing the frontier of
quantum information processing with globally-controlled analog platforms.

### [345] [A Systematic Approach to Predict the Impact of Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18439)
*Anders Mølmen Høst,Pierre Lison,Leon Moonen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: TRIAGE是一个使用大型语言模型自动将CVE漏洞映射到ATT&CK技术的混合方法，结合了基于规则推理和数据驱动推理，提高了漏洞影响分析的效率和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的漏洞数据库（如NVD）缺乏关于漏洞实际影响的信息，特别是对手可能利用的TTPs技术。手动映射CVEs到ATT&CK技术既耗时又具有挑战性，需要自动化支持。

Method: 采用双管齐下的自动化方法：首先使用基于MITRE CVE映射方法论的LLM提示预测初始技术列表，然后结合第二个基于上下文学习的LLM模块结果，形成混合方法。

Result: 评估显示上下文学习方法优于单独的映射方法，混合方法提高了利用技术的召回率。GPT-4o-mini在此任务上表现优于Llama3.3-70B。

Conclusion: LLMs可用于自动预测网络安全漏洞的影响，TRIAGE使CVEs到ATT&CK的映射过程更加高效。

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD),
offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but
often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics,
techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the
vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a
challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities
published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses
Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&CK
knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE
Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then
combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context
learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach
strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our
evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping
methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We
also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task.
Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the
impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping
CVEs to ATT&CK more efficient.
  Keywords: vulnerability impact, CVE, ATT&CK techniques, large language
models, automated mapping.

### [346] [UniC-RAG: Universal Knowledge Corruption Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18652)
*Runpeng Geng,Yanting Wang,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: UniC-RAG是一种针对检索增强生成(RAG)系统的通用知识污染攻击方法，通过优化少量对抗文本同时攻击大量不同主题的用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统容易受到知识污染攻击，但现有研究主要针对特定查询或相似主题的查询进行攻击，缺乏能够同时攻击大量多样化查询的通用攻击方法。

Method: 将UniC-RAG建模为优化问题，设计有效解决方案，包括基于平衡相似性的聚类方法来增强攻击效果，通过注入少量对抗文本污染知识库。

Result: UniC-RAG在包含数百万文本的知识库中注入100个对抗文本即可同时攻击2000个用户查询，攻击成功率超过90%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: UniC-RAG攻击效果显著，现有防御机制不足以抵御此类攻击，凸显了RAG系统需要新的防御机制来应对通用知识污染攻击的威胁。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are widely deployed in
real-world applications in diverse domains such as finance, healthcare, and
cybersecurity. However, many studies showed that they are vulnerable to
knowledge corruption attacks, where an attacker can inject adversarial texts
into the knowledge database of a RAG system to induce the LLM to generate
attacker-desired outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on attacking specific
queries or queries with similar topics (or keywords). In this work, we propose
UniC-RAG, a universal knowledge corruption attack against RAG systems. Unlike
prior work, UniC-RAG jointly optimizes a small number of adversarial texts that
can simultaneously attack a large number of user queries with diverse topics
and domains, enabling an attacker to achieve various malicious objectives, such
as directing users to malicious websites, triggering harmful command execution,
or launching denial-of-service attacks. We formulate UniC-RAG as an
optimization problem and further design an effective solution to solve it,
including a balanced similarity-based clustering method to enhance the attack's
effectiveness. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that UniC-RAG is highly
effective and significantly outperforms baselines. For instance, UniC-RAG could
achieve over 90% attack success rate by injecting 100 adversarial texts into a
knowledge database with millions of texts to simultaneously attack a large set
of user queries (e.g., 2,000). Additionally, we evaluate existing defenses and
show that they are insufficient to defend against UniC-RAG, highlighting the
need for new defense mechanisms in RAG systems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FALCON是一个基于大语言模型的自主代理框架，能够从网络威胁情报数据实时生成可部署的入侵检测系统规则，并通过内置多阶段验证器进行评估，准确率达到95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于签名的入侵检测系统需要频繁更新规则来应对不断演变的网络威胁，但规则更新过程耗时且延迟部署，降低了整体安全准备状态。

Method: 开发了FALCON自主代理框架，利用大语言模型从CTI数据实时生成IDS规则，包含内置多阶段验证器，同时支持网络型(Snort)和主机型(YARA)两种检测媒介。

Result: 评估显示FALCON在自动规则生成方面表现优异，平均准确率达到95%，多位网络安全分析师的定性评估显示84%的评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明LLM驱动的数据挖掘在实时网络威胁缓解方面具有可行性和有效性，为自主IDS规则生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) detect malicious activities
by matching network or host activity against predefined rules. These rules are
derived from extensive Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), which includes attack
signatures and behavioral patterns obtained through automated tools and manual
threat analysis, such as sandboxing. The CTI is then transformed into
actionable rules for the IDS engine, enabling real-time detection and
prevention. However, the constant evolution of cyber threats necessitates
frequent rule updates, which delay deployment time and weaken overall security
readiness. Recent advancements in agentic systems powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer the potential for autonomous IDS rule generation with
internal evaluation. We introduce FALCON, an autonomous agentic framework that
generates deployable IDS rules from CTI data in real-time and evaluates them
using built-in multi-phased validators. To demonstrate versatility, we target
both network (Snort) and host-based (YARA) mediums and construct a
comprehensive dataset of IDS rules with their corresponding CTIs. Our
evaluations indicate FALCON excels in automatic rule generation, with an
average of 95% accuracy validated by qualitative evaluation with 84%
inter-rater agreement among multiple cybersecurity analysts across all metrics.
These results underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of LLM-driven data
mining for real-time cyber threat mitigation.

### [348] [The Double-edged Sword of LLM-based Data Reconstruction: Understanding and Mitigating Contextual Vulnerability in Word-level Differential Privacy Text Sanitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18976)
*Stephen Meisenbacher,Alexandra Klymenko,Andreea-Elena Bodea,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究LLMs如何利用差分隐私文本脱敏中的上下文漏洞进行数据重建攻击，发现LLMs既能推断原始语义降低隐私保护，也能用于提升脱敏文本的质量和隐私性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管词级DP文本脱敏方法简单，但由于随机化过程中会留下原始文本的上下文线索（上下文漏洞），且LLMs具有强大的上下文理解和推理能力，需要探索LLMs如何利用这种漏洞。

Method: 使用先进的LLMs测试更广泛的脱敏机制在不同隐私级别下的表现，进行数据重建攻击实验，分析LLMs对DP脱敏文本的推断能力。

Result: 实验发现LLM数据重建攻击具有双刃剑效应：既能推断原始语义降低实证隐私保护，也能通过后处理步骤提升DP脱敏文本的质量和隐私性。

Conclusion: 建议将LLM数据重建作为后处理步骤，通过对抗性思维来增强隐私保护，平衡隐私和效用之间的关系。

Abstract: Differentially private text sanitization refers to the process of privatizing
texts under the framework of Differential Privacy (DP), providing provable
privacy guarantees while also empirically defending against adversaries seeking
to harm privacy. Despite their simplicity, DP text sanitization methods
operating at the word level exhibit a number of shortcomings, among them the
tendency to leave contextual clues from the original texts due to randomization
during sanitization $\unicode{x2013}$ this we refer to as $\textit{contextual
vulnerability}$. Given the powerful contextual understanding and inference
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we explore to what extent LLMs
can be leveraged to exploit the contextual vulnerability of DP-sanitized texts.
We expand on previous work not only in the use of advanced LLMs, but also in
testing a broader range of sanitization mechanisms at various privacy levels.
Our experiments uncover a double-edged sword effect of LLM-based data
reconstruction attacks on privacy and utility: while LLMs can indeed infer
original semantics and sometimes degrade empirical privacy protections, they
can also be used for good, to improve the quality and privacy of DP-sanitized
texts. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for using LLM data
reconstruction as a post-processing step, serving to increase privacy
protection by thinking adversarially.

*Martin Lochner,Keegan Keplinger*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SOC操作人员主要使用LLM来理解复杂文本字符串，约40%的使用场景都与此相关，表明LLM可以支持SOC工作流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SOC专家如何自愿使用大型语言模型来支持实时安全操作，以了解人机协作的新模式

Method: 基于10个月的SOC操作人员使用GPT-4的聊天数据，采用BERTopic模型和新颖的主题建模工作流进行分析

Result: SOC操作人员主要使用LLM来促进对复杂文本字符串的理解，这种用例约占LLM使用量的40%

Conclusion: SOC操作人员需要快速解释复杂命令，他们自然倾向于利用LLM支持这一活动，表明可以通过设计协作式LLM工具来增强SOC工作流程

Abstract: Objective: This work describes the topic modelling of Security Operations
Centre (SOC) use of a large language model (LLM), during live security
operations. The goal is to better understand how these specialists voluntarily
use this tool.
  Background: Human-automation teams have been extensively studied, but
transformer-based language models have sparked a new wave of collaboration. SOC
personnel at a major cybersecurity provider used an LLM to support live
security operations. This study examines how these specialists incorporated the
LLM into their work.
  Method: Our data set is the result of 10 months of SOC operators accessing
GPT-4 over an internally deployed HTTP-based chat application. We performed two
topic modelling exercises, first using the established BERTopic model
(Grootendorst, 2022), and second, using a novel topic modeling workflow.
  Results: Both the BERTopic analysis and novel modelling approach revealed
that SOC operators primarily used the LLM to facilitate their understanding of
complex text strings. Variations on this use-case accounted for ~40% of SOC LLM
usage.
  Conclusion: SOC operators are required to rapidly interpret complex commands
and similar information. Their natural tendency to leverage LLMs to support
this activity indicates that their workflow can be supported and augmented by
designing collaborative LLM tools for use in the SOC.
  Application: This work can aid in creating next-generation tools for Security
Operations Centres. By understanding common use-cases, we can develop workflows
supporting SOC task flow. One example is a right-click context menu for
executing a command line analysis LLM call directly in the SOC environment.

*Rui Zhang,Zihan Wang,Tianli Yang,Hongwei Li,Wenbo Jiang,Qingchuan Zhao,Yang Liu,Guowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Hidden Tail是一种针对视觉语言模型的隐蔽资源消耗攻击，通过生成对抗图像使模型输出最大长度的隐藏特殊标记，在保持攻击隐蔽性的同时显著增加推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM资源消耗攻击在延长输出序列时会产生不相关的异常内容，破坏了攻击的隐蔽性，需要在有效性和隐蔽性之间做出权衡

Method: 使用复合损失函数平衡语义保持、重复特殊标记诱导和EOS标记抑制，通过动态权重策略优化生成提示无关的对抗图像

Result: 攻击效果显著，输出长度增加达19.2倍，达到最大标记限制，同时保持攻击隐蔽性

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了VLM资源消耗攻击中有效性与隐蔽性的权衡问题，凸显了提高VLM对抗效率导向威胁鲁棒性的紧迫需求

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but their high inference cost makes them vulnerable to resource
consumption attacks. Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by
optimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs. However,
these extended outputs often introduce irrelevant abnormal content,
compromising attack stealthiness. This trade-off between effectiveness and
stealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this
challenge, we propose \textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption
attack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to
generate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.
Our method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic
preservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the
end-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.
Extensive experiments show that \textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing
attacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\times$ and reaching the
maximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness. These results
highlight the urgent need to improve the robustness of VLMs against
efficiency-oriented adversarial threats. Our code is available at
https://github.com/zhangrui4041/Hidden_Tail.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个保护视觉语言模型安全的新框架，通过安全感知的思维链推理和直接偏好优化，在保持模型实用性的同时显著提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型安全方法存在过度防御损害实用性，或浅层对齐无法检测复杂威胁的问题，需要深度推理的安全保护方案。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，包含PRISM-CoT数据集教授安全感知思维链推理，以及通过蒙特卡洛树搜索生成的PRISM-DPO进行直接偏好优化，建立精确的安全边界。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：Qwen2-VL在JailbreakV-28K上攻击成功率仅0.15%，LLaVA-1.5在VLBreak上比之前最佳方法提升90%，在MIS多图像基准上攻击成功率降至8.70%。

Conclusion: PRISM在保持甚至增强模型实用性的同时，提供了强大的安全防护，对自适应攻击具有强鲁棒性，并能有效泛化到分布外挑战。

Abstract: Safeguarding vision-language models (VLMs) is a critical challenge, as
existing methods often suffer from over-defense, which harms utility, or rely
on shallow alignment, failing to detect complex threats that require deep
reasoning. To this end, we introduce PRISM (Principled Reasoning for Integrated
Safety in Multimodality), a system2-like framework that aligns VLMs by
embedding a structured, safety-aware reasoning process. Our framework consists
of two key components: PRISM-CoT, a dataset that teaches safety-aware
chain-of-thought reasoning, and PRISM-DPO, generated via Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to further refine this reasoning through Direct Preference
Optimization to help obtain a delicate safety boundary. Comprehensive
evaluations demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness, achieving remarkably low attack
success rates including 0.15% on JailbreakV-28K for Qwen2-VL and 90%
improvement over the previous best method on VLBreak for LLaVA-1.5. PRISM also
exhibits strong robustness against adaptive attacks, significantly increasing
computational costs for adversaries, and generalizes effectively to
out-of-distribution challenges, reducing attack success rates to just 8.70% on
the challenging multi-image MIS benchmark. Remarkably, this robust defense is
achieved while preserving, and in some cases enhancing, model utility. To
promote reproducibility, we have made our code, data, and model weights
available at https://github.com/SaFoLab-WISC/PRISM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于签名的检测系统无法有效应对APT攻击的隐蔽性、适应性和持久性特点，现有检测系统缺乏动态适应能力来应对不断演变的攻击策略。

Method: 使用自编码器对进程行为进行潜在编码，构建多智能体强化学习系统（包括Q-Learning、PPO、DQN等算法），当智能体决策不确定时触发主动学习循环模拟专家反馈，通过加权集成投票机制进行最终预测。

Result: 开发了一个自适应的防御系统框架，能够动态适应APT攻击的演变，提高检测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过深度学习和强化学习的结合，加上主动学习机制，为APT检测提供了更加灵活和自适应的解决方案，能够有效应对现代网络威胁的挑战。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.

Motivation: 车联网系统中广泛使用机器学习技术，但存在数据隐私泄露风险，特别是智能交通和驾驶员安全应用中可能暴露用户位置或医疗数据

Method: 提出SecureV2X系统，在服务器和车辆之间部署安全神经网络推理，研究安全瞌睡检测和安全闯红灯检测两个多代理V2X应用

Conclusion: SecureV2X是一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，能够同时支持大量安全计算交互，有效解决车联网系统中的隐私保护问题

Abstract: Autonomous driving and V2X technologies have developed rapidly in the past
decade, leading to improved safety and efficiency in modern transportation.
These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside
infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning
capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems
raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly
concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can
implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as
EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable,
multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the
server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X
applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation
detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and
scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions
simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires
$143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less
communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.
Moreover, it achieves a runtime nearly $100\times$ faster than state-of-the-art
benchmarks in object detection tasks for red light violation detection.

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities,
transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the
explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient
distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal
collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the
artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) community. With advancements in deep

significant progress with emerging AIoT applications, moving beyond isolated

*Yu Kamimizu,Hao Liu,Toshiyuki Nakata*

TL;DR: 通过数据驱动方法发现了三个关键空气动力学机制，显著提高了准稳态模型的预测精度，适用于不同雷诺数的昆虫飞行分析


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有昆虫飞行空气动力学研究方法存在高保真模拟计算成本高、理论模型精度低的局限性，需要提高准稳态模型的准确性

Method: 从5000个候选运动学函数中筛选数学表达式，识别并量化三个关键机制：前进比效应、展向运动速度效应和旋转瓦格纳效应

Result: 新模型显著减少了预测误差，在鹰蛾前飞（高雷诺数）和果蝇机动（低雷诺数）中均表现良好

Conclusion: 数据驱动的准稳态模型实现了快速空气动力学分析，为理解昆虫飞行进化适应和开发生物启发飞行机器人提供了实用工具

Abstract: Insects control unsteady aerodynamic forces on flapping wings to navigate
complex environments. While understanding these forces is vital for biology,
physics, and engineering, existing evaluation methods face trade-offs:
high-fidelity simulations are computationally or experimentally expensive and
lack explanatory power, whereas theoretical models based on quasi-steady
assumptions offer insights but exhibit low accuracy. To overcome these
limitations and thus enhance the accuracy of quasi-steady aerodynamic models,
we applied a data-driven approach involving discovery and formulation of
previously overlooked critical mechanisms. Through selection from 5,000
candidate kinematic functions, we identified mathematical expressions for three
key additional mechanisms -- the effect of advance ratio, effect of spanwise
kinematic velocity, and rotational Wagner effect -- which had been
qualitatively recognized but were not formulated. Incorporating these
mechanisms considerably reduced the prediction errors of the quasi-steady model
using the computational fluid dynamics results as the ground truth, both in
hawkmoth forward flight (at high Reynolds numbers) and fruit fly maneuvers (at
low Reynolds numbers). The data-driven quasi-steady model enables rapid
aerodynamic analysis, serving as a practical tool for understanding
evolutionary adaptations in insect flight and developing bio-inspired flying
robots.

TL;DR: 提出了ADUWT算法，通过剪裁低敏感度点并应用数据依赖的均匀权重来构建核心集，为ERM目标提供均匀的相对误差近似


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为经验风险最小化(ERM)问题开发一个严格的理论框架，构建确定性核心集以提升计算效率

Method: 自适应确定性均匀权重剪裁(ADUWT)算法，剪除敏感度下界最低的点，对剩余点应用数据依赖的均匀权重

Result: 实现了整个假设空间上ERM目标的均匀(1±ε)相对误差近似，提供了最优性证明、实例依赖的大小分析和可处理的敏感度预言机

Conclusion: 理论分析完整，实验结果与理论一致，提出了关于实例最优预言机、确定性流处理和公平约束ERM的开放问题

Abstract: We develop a rigorous framework for deterministic coreset construction in
empirical risk minimization (ERM). Our central contribution is the Adaptive
Deterministic Uniform-Weight Trimming (ADUWT) algorithm, which constructs a
coreset by excising points with the lowest sensitivity bounds and applying a
data-dependent uniform weight to the remainder. The method yields a uniform
$(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative-error approximation for the ERM objective over the
entire hypothesis space. We provide complete analysis, including (i) a minimax
characterization proving the optimality of the adaptive weight, (ii) an
instance-dependent size analysis in terms of a \emph{Sensitivity Heterogeneity
Index}, and (iii) tractable sensitivity oracles for kernel ridge regression,
regularized logistic regression, and linear SVM. Reproducibility is supported
by precise pseudocode for the algorithm, sensitivity oracles, and evaluation
pipeline. Empirical results align with the theory. We conclude with open
problems on instance-optimal oracles, deterministic streaming, and
fairness-constrained ERM.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 本文通过研究FTPL在非对称无界Fréchet型扰动下的BOBW结果，扩展了FTPL的分析基础，发现了对称Fréchet型扰动在多臂赌博机中的局限性，并建立了二臂设置中对称无界扰动的首个BOBW保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FTRL策略通过混合正则化器在各种设置中实现了BOBW结果，但FTPL的类似结果由于分析挑战而有限。本文旨在推进FTPL的分析基础，探索FTRL-FTPL对偶性，并研究非对称无界Fréchet型扰动下的BOBW结果。

Method: 重新审视无界扰动的经典FTRL-FTPL对偶性，建立FTPL在广泛非对称无界Fréchet型扰动族下的BOBW结果，包括结合Gumbel型和Fréchet型尾部的混合扰动。研究1/2-Tsallis熵与Fréchet型扰动的关系，并通过数值观察和实例分析验证理论结果。

Result: 成功扩展了FTPL的BOBW结果，为二臂设置中的对称无界扰动建立了首个BOBW保证。但在多臂赌博机中发现对称Fréchet型扰动违反标准BOBW分析的关键条件，这是非对称或非负Fréchet型扰动中未观察到的问题。

Conclusion: 研究推进了FTPL的分析基础，提供了与混合正则化方法竞争的新FTPL策略设计见解。对称Fréchet型扰动在多臂设置中的局限性表明需要进一步研究，不能直接将二臂情况的关系推广到一般情况，强调了在更广泛设置中完全理解FTPL行为的必要性。

Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) policies have achieved
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) results in various settings through hybrid
regularizers, whereas analogous results for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL)
remain limited due to inherent analytical challenges. To advance the analytical
foundations of FTPL, we revisit classical FTRL-FTPL duality for unbounded
perturbations and establish BOBW results for FTPL under a broad family of
asymmetric unbounded Fr\'echet-type perturbations, including hybrid
perturbations combining Gumbel-type and Fr\'echet-type tails. These results not
only extend the BOBW results of FTPL but also offer new insights into designing
alternative FTPL policies competitive with hybrid regularization approaches.
Motivated by earlier observations in two-armed bandits, we further investigate
the connection between the $1/2$-Tsallis entropy and a Fr\'echet-type
perturbation. Our numerical observations suggest that it corresponds to a
symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbation, and based on this, we establish the
first BOBW guarantee for symmetric unbounded perturbations in the two-armed
setting. In contrast, in general multi-armed bandits, we find an instance in
which symmetric Fr\'echet-type perturbations violate the key condition for
standard BOBW analysis, which is a problem not observed with asymmetric or
nonnegative Fr\'echet-type perturbations. Although this example does not rule
out alternative analyses achieving BOBW results, it suggests the limitations of
directly applying the relationship observed in two-armed cases to the general
case and thus emphasizes the need for further investigation to fully understand
the behavior of FTPL in broader settings.

TL;DR: 首个上下文组合半户机算法，同时在对抗性和突变随机制下实现最优后悔界，通过FTRL框架和复杂度优化提高效率


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统算法在不同环境下的表现差异问题，并充分利用上下文信息来提高算法效果

Method: 基于FTRL框架结合香农正则化器，通过KKT条件将高维投影问题转换为单变量求根问题，大幅提高计算效率

Result: 在对抗性制下达到O(√T)后悔界，在突变随机制下达到O(ln T)后悔界，同时获得显著的每轮计算速度提升

Conclusion: 该算法不仅具有理论优势，还通过效率优化实现了大规模实时应用的可行性，为组合半户机问题提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: We introduce the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for contextual
combinatorial semi-bandits that simultaneously guarantees
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial regime and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\ln T)$ regret in the corrupted stochastic regime. Our
approach builds on the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework equipped
with a Shannon entropy regularizer, yielding a flexible method that admits
efficient implementations. Beyond regret bounds, we tackle the practical
bottleneck in FTRL (or, equivalently, Online Stochastic Mirror Descent) arising
from the high-dimensional projection step encountered in each round of
interaction. By leveraging the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we transform the
$K$-dimensional convex projection problem into a single-variable root-finding
problem, dramatically accelerating each round. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that this combined strategy not only attains the attractive regret
bounds of best-of-both-worlds algorithms but also delivers substantial
per-round speed-ups, making it well-suited for large-scale, real-time
applications.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合特征-特征和特征-目标关系的特征筛选方法，通过惩罚性最小冗余最大相关性(mRMR)程序识别非活跃特征，并使用knockoff过滤器控制错误发现率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法往往只关注特征与目标的关系，忽略了特征间的相互关系。需要一种能够同时考虑特征-特征和特征-目标关系，并能有效控制错误发现率的特征筛选方法。

Method: 采用惩罚性mRMR方法，使用非凸正则化器进行惩罚，通过多阶段knockoff过滤器程序来丢弃非活跃特征，同时控制FDR。

Result: 方法性能与HSIC-LASSO相当，但在特征选择数量上更加保守。只需要设置FDR阈值，无需指定要保留的特征数量。在模拟和真实数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的特征筛选解决方案，能够准确识别非活跃特征，控制错误发现率，且参数设置简单，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose a feature screening method that integrates both feature-feature
and feature-target relationships. Inactive features are identified via a
penalized minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) procedure, which is the
continuous version of the classic mRMR penalized by a non-convex regularizer,
and where the parameters estimated as zero coefficients represent the set of
inactive features. We establish the conditions under which zero coefficients
are correctly identified to guarantee accurate recovery of inactive features.
We introduce a multi-stage procedure based on the knockoff filter enabling the
penalized mRMR to discard inactive features while controlling the false
discovery rate (FDR). Our method performs comparably to HSIC-LASSO but is more
conservative in the number of selected features. It only requires setting an
FDR threshold, rather than specifying the number of features to retain. The
effectiveness of the method is illustrated through simulations and real-world
datasets. The code to reproduce this work is available on the following GitHub:

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了RNN中各种记忆概念（稳态、回声状态、状态遗忘、输入遗忘、衰减记忆）之间的关系，统一了这些概念的语言表述，推导了新的等价关系，并提供了现有结果的替代证明。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RNN在处理时序数据时表现出强大的记忆能力，但关于其记忆行为的不同概念（如稳态、回声状态、状态遗忘等）虽然经常被互换使用，但它们之间的精确关系尚不明确，需要统一的理论框架来澄清这些概念。

Method: 采用统一的数学语言来表述各种记忆概念，通过理论推导建立这些概念之间的等价关系和蕴含关系，并提供现有理论结果的替代证明方法。

Result: 成功统一了RNN中多种记忆概念的表达方式，推导出了新的等价关系和蕴含关系，为理解RNN的记忆机制提供了更清晰的理论基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作澄清了RNN中各种记忆概念之间的关系，为深入理解RNN的时序信息处理能力提供了统一的理论框架，有助于推动RNN理论和应用的发展。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have become increasingly popular in
information processing tasks involving time series and temporal data. A
fundamental property of RNNs is their ability to create reliable input/output
responses, often linked to how the network handles its memory of the
information it processed. Various notions have been proposed to conceptualize
the behavior of memory in RNNs, including steady states, echo states, state
forgetting, input forgetting, and fading memory. Although these notions are
often used interchangeably, their precise relationships remain unclear. This
work aims to unify these notions in a common language, derive new implications
and equivalences between them, and provide alternative proofs to some existing
results. By clarifying the relationships between these concepts, this research
contributes to a deeper understanding of RNNs and their temporal information
processing capabilities.

Main category: q-fin.PR

TL;DR: 本研究首次在资产定价领域大规模应用先进的RNN注意力模型，包括加性注意力、Luong三种注意力、全局自注意力和滑动窗口稀疏注意力机制，在极端市场条件下进行稳定性测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统机器学习资产定价模型的局限性，如时间依赖性损失和短期记忆问题，并解决Transformer等注意力模型忽视的未来数据泄漏问题。

Method: 使用预训练的RNN注意力模型，采用因果掩码防止未来信息泄漏，考虑资产定价数据的时间稀疏性特征，通过简化模型结构减少过拟合。在美国420只大盘股上进行实验，测试包括COVID-19前、中、后三个不同市场阶段。

Result: 在价值加权策略回测中，全局自注意力模型和稀疏注意力模型在获得绝对收益和对冲下行风险方面表现优异，在COVID-19期间年化Sortino比率分别达刲2.0和1.80。稀疏注意力模型在股票市值规模方面表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 注意力模型在资产定价领域具有重要应用价值，能够有效处理时间序列数据并避免未来信息泄漏。稀疏注意力模型在稳定性方面表现更优，为未来经验经济研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the pretrained RNN attention models with the
mainstream attention mechanisms such as additive attention, Luong's three
attentions, global self-attention (Self-att) and sliding window sparse
attention (Sparse-att) for the empirical asset pricing research on top 420
large-cap US stocks. This is the first paper on the large-scale
state-of-the-art (SOTA) attention mechanisms applied in the asset pricing
context. They overcome the limitations of the traditional machine learning (ML)
based asset pricing, such as mis-capturing the temporal dependency and short
memory. Moreover, the enforced causal masks in the attention mechanisms address
the future data leaking issue ignored by the more advanced attention-based
models, such as the classic Transformer. The proposed attention models also
consider the temporal sparsity characteristic of asset pricing data and
mitigate potential overfitting issues by deploying the simplified model
structures. This provides some insights for future empirical economic research.
All models are examined in three periods, which cover pre-COVID-19 (mild
uptrend), COVID-19 (steep uptrend with a large drawdown) and one year
post-COVID-19 (sideways movement with high fluctuations), for testing the
stability of these models under extreme market conditions. The study finds that
in value-weighted portfolio back testing, Model Self-att and Model Sparse-att
exhibit great capabilities in deriving the absolute returns and hedging
downside risks, while they achieve an annualized Sortino ratio of 2.0 and 1.80
respectively in the period with COVID-19. And Model Sparse-att performs more
stably than Model Self-att from the perspective of absolute portfolio returns
with respect to the size of stocks' market capitalization.

Main category: q-bio.NC

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法主要关注成对神经元连接，难以捕捉神经系统中复杂的高维信息流模式。需要一种能够整合方向性影响和拓扑复杂性的框架来分析神经系统的全局组织模式。

Method: 使用传递熵量化神经元间的方向性影响，生成加权有向图，然后应用定向持久同源性分析这些图的多尺度拓扑结构。

Result: 在合成脉冲网络、图像分类网络和小鼠皮层记录中，该方法成功区分了任务复杂度、刺激结构和行为状态，高维特征在复杂或噪声条件下更加显著。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个原则性的方法，将定向信息流映射到人工和生物神经系统的全局组织模式上，具有通用性和可解释性，适用于时间分辨的二进制脉冲数据。

Abstract: We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that
integrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to
characterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies
directional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that
reflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling
assessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and
dimensions.
  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic
gate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed
inputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across
all settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task
complexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional
features become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting
interaction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings
offer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global
organizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The
framework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural
systems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.

Motivation: 现有单元生成模型缺乏明确的多运动混合控制框架，需要一种能够在单次生成过程中实现运动混合的方法。

Method: 提出了时间条件生成模型，以及骨架感知归一化机制，用于指导不同运动之间的平滑迁移过程。

Result: 在多种动画风格和不同形态学骨架上进行了广泛评估，证明方法能够产生合理、平滑且可控制的运动混合效果。

Conclusion: 该框架以统一高效的方式实现了可靠的单元运动混合生成，为动画师提供了不需额外数据或重新训练的可控制运动变体生成能力。

Abstract: Training a generative model on a single human skeletal motion sequence
without being bound to a specific kinematic tree has drawn significant
attention from the animation community. Unlike text-to-motion generation,
single-shot models allow animators to controllably generate variations of
existing motion patterns without requiring additional data or extensive
retraining. However, existing single-shot methods do not explicitly offer a
controllable framework for blending two or more motions within a single
generative pass. In this paper, we present the first single-shot motion
blending framework that enables seamless blending by temporally conditioning
the generation process. Our method introduces a skeleton-aware normalization
mechanism to guide the transition between motions, allowing smooth, data-driven
control over when and how motions blend. We perform extensive quantitative and
qualitative evaluations across various animation styles and different kinematic
skeletons, demonstrating that our approach produces plausible, smooth, and
controllable motion blends in a unified and efficient manner.

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够生成空间连贯、逼真且多样化的场景，性能优于先前方法。

Conclusion: SemLayoutDiff提供了一个有效的统一框架，能够生成符合建筑约束的多样化3D室内场景，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We present SemLayoutDiff, a unified model for synthesizing diverse 3D indoor
scenes across multiple room types. The model introduces a scene layout
representation combining a top-down semantic map and attributes for each
object. Unlike prior approaches, which cannot condition on architectural
constraints, SemLayoutDiff employs a categorical diffusion model capable of
conditioning scene synthesis explicitly on room masks. It first generates a
coherent semantic map, followed by a cross-attention-based network to predict
furniture placements that respect the synthesized layout. Our method also
accounts for architectural elements such as doors and windows, ensuring that
generated furniture arrangements remain practical and unobstructed. Experiments
on the 3D-FRONT dataset show that SemLayoutDiff produces spatially coherent,
realistic, and varied scenes, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: PanoHair提供了比现有方法更高效的头发丝状几何生成方案，显著改进了多视角数据采集的复杂性问题

Abstract: Achieving realistic hair strand synthesis is essential for creating lifelike
digital humans, but producing high-fidelity hair strand geometry remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods require a complex setup for data
acquisition, involving multi-view images captured in constrained studio
environments. Additionally, these methods have longer hair volume estimation
and strand synthesis times, which hinder efficiency. We introduce PanoHair, a
model that estimates head geometry as signed distance fields using knowledge
distillation from a pre-trained generative teacher model for head synthesis.
Our approach enables the prediction of semantic segmentation masks and 3D
orientations specifically for the hair region of the estimated geometry. Our
method is generative and can generate diverse hairstyles with latent space
manipulations. For real images, our approach involves an inversion process to
infer latent codes and produces visually appealing hair strands, offering a
streamlined alternative to complex multi-view data acquisition setups. Given
the latent code, PanoHair generates a clean manifold mesh for the hair region
in under 5 seconds, along with semantic and orientation maps, marking a
significant improvement over existing methods, as demonstrated in our
experiments.

Motivation: INPC虽然在新视角合成中实现了最先进的图像质量，但由于渲染过程中需要查询神经网络，其实际应用受到较慢渲染速度的限制。

Method: 提出了四种主要优化：改进的光栅化器实现、更有效的采样技术、用于孔洞填充的卷积神经网络预训练，以及在推理时将点建模为小高斯分布以提升外推视图质量。

Result: 优化后的INPC管线实现了训练速度提升25%、渲染速度提升2倍、显存使用减少20%，同时图像质量略有改善。

Conclusion: 这些优化方法不仅适用于INPC，还具有广泛的适用性，系统性地提升了神经点云表示的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Point Cloud (INPC) is a recent hybrid representation that
combines the expressiveness of neural fields with the efficiency of point-based
rendering, achieving state-of-the-art image quality in novel view synthesis.
However, as with other high-quality approaches that query neural networks
during rendering, the practical usability of INPC is limited by comparatively
slow rendering. In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that
significantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC
without sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an
improved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the
incorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for
hole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small
Gaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,
close-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly
applicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a
series of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster
training, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight
image quality improvements.

Motivation: 单细胞多组学数据包含丰富的细胞状态信息，但细胞分化发育是一个连续动态过程，基于这些数据计算建模和推断细胞相互作用模式仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出基于内外组学对比学习的scI2CL框架，通过对比学习从互补的多组学数据中学习全面的细胞表征。

Result: 在四个下游任务中验证了scI2CL的有效性：细胞聚类超越8个SOTA方法；细胞亚型分析发现3个隐藏单核细胞亚群；正确构建细胞发育轨迹；解决CD4+T细胞亚群误分类问题。

Conclusion: scI2CL能够准确表征细胞间的跨组学关系，有效融合多组学数据并学习具有区分性的细胞表征，支持各种下游分析任务。

Abstract: Single-cell multi-omics data contain huge information of cellular states, and
analyzing these data can reveal valuable insights into cellular heterogeneity,
diseases, and biological processes. However, as cell differentiation \&
development is a continuous and dynamic process, it remains challenging to
computationally model and infer cell interaction patterns based on single-cell
multi-omics data. This paper presents scI2CL, a new single-cell multi-omics
fusion framework based on intra- and inter-omics contrastive learning, to learn
comprehensive and discriminative cellular representations from complementary
multi-omics data for various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments of four
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of scI2CL and its superiority over
existing peers. Concretely, in cell clustering, scI2CL surpasses eight
state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used real-world datasets. In cell
subtyping, scI2CL effectively distinguishes three latent monocyte cell
subpopulations, which are not discovered by existing methods. Simultaneously,
scI2CL is the only method that correctly constructs the cell developmental
trajectory from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to Memory B cells. In
addition, scI2CL resolves the misclassification of cell types between two
subpopulations of CD4+ T cells, while existing methods fail to precisely
distinguish the mixed cells. In summary, scI2CL can accurately characterize
cross-omics relationships among cells, thus effectively fuses multi-omics data
and learns discriminative cellular representations to support various
downstream analysis tasks.

Method: 使用欧几里得随机场论方法，将神经激活和权重分别映射为费米子物质场和规范场，引入虚构的Langevin时间实现协变规范固定，并通过双拷贝复制方法统一计算最大Lyapunov指数。

Result: 理论预测通过标准多层感知机的数值模拟得到验证，同时提出了使用幅度-相位参数化的规范不变神经网络(GINN)实现。

Conclusion: 该映射方法成功地将深度神经网络与量子电动力学联系起来，为理解神经网络的动力学特性提供了新的理论工具，并展示了规范参数与核设计选择之间的对应关系。

Abstract: The development of a Euclidean stochastic field-theoretic approach that maps
deep neural networks (DNNs) to quantum electrodynamics (QED) with local U(1)
symmetry is presented. Neural activations and weights are represented by
fermionic matter and gauge fields, with a fictitious Langevin time enabling
covariant gauge fixing. This mapping identifies the gauge parameter with kernel
design choices in wide DNNs, relating stability thresholds to gauge-dependent
amplification factors. Finite-width fluctuations correspond to loop corrections
in QED. As a proof of concept, we validate the theoretical predictions through
numerical simulations of standard multilayer perceptrons and, in parallel,
propose a gauge-invariant neural network (GINN) implementation using
magnitude--phase parameterization of weights. Finally, a double-copy replica
approach is shown to unify the computation of the largest Lyapunov exponent in
stochastic QED and wide DNNs.

Conclusion: 通过结构化的集群通信原语和计算通信融合框架，有效解决了LLM解码的性能瓶颈，为大型模型推理提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) decoding suffers from high latency due to
fragmented execution across operators and heavy reliance on off-chip memory for
data exchange and reduction. This execution model limits opportunities for
fusion and incurs significant memory traffic and kernel launch overhead. While
modern architectures such as NVIDIA Hopper provide distributed shared memory
and low-latency intra-cluster interconnects, they expose only low-level data
movement instructions, lacking structured abstractions for collective on-chip
communication. To bridge this software-hardware gap, we introduce two
cluster-level communication primitives, ClusterReduce and ClusterGather, which
abstract common communication patterns and enable structured, high-speed data
exchange and reduction between thread blocks within a cluster, allowing
intermediate results to be on-chip without involving off-chip memory. Building
on these abstractions, we design ClusterFusion, an execution framework that
schedules communication and computation jointly to expand operator fusion scope
by composing decoding stages such as QKV Projection, Attention, and Output
Projection into a single fused kernels. Evaluations on H100 GPUs show that
ClusterFusion outperforms state-of-the-art inference frameworks by 1.61x on
average in end-to-end latency across different models and configurations. The

TL;DR: CARMA是一个服务器级别的任务级协同定位感知资源管理系统，通过ML-based GPU内存估计框架和协同定位策略，解决DL训练任务在GPU上协同定位时的内存不足和资源干扰问题，显著提升GPU利用率并降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业级基础设施研究表明，深度学习训练的核心计算资源GPU经常利用率低下。任务协同定位可以解决这个问题，但会导致内存不足崩溃和资源干扰导致的性能下降。

Method: 提出CARMA系统，包含GPUMemNet（基于ML的GPU内存估计框架）来最小化内存错误，引入协同定位策略来限制GPU利用率以减少干扰，并提供任务崩溃后的恢复机制。

Result: 在基于真实DL训练任务轨迹的评估中，CARMA使GPU利用率提升39.3%，端到端执行时间减少约26.7%，GPU能耗降低约14.2%。

Conclusion: CARMA系统有效解决了DL任务在GPU上协同定位的挑战，显著提高了资源利用率、降低了执行时间和能耗，为大规模深度学习训练提供了可靠的资源管理解决方案。

Abstract: Studies conducted on enterprise-scale infrastructure have shown that GPUs --
the core computational resource for deep learning (DL) training -- are often
significantly underutilized. DL task collocation on GPUs is an opportunity to
address this challenge. However, it may result in (1) out-of-memory crashes for
the subsequently arriving task and (2) slowdowns for all tasks sharing the GPU
due to resource interference. The former challenge poses a threat to
robustness, while the latter affects the quality of service and energy
efficiency.
  We propose CARMA, a server-scale task-level collocation-aware resource
management system that handles both collocation challenges. CARMA encompasses
GPUMemNet, a novel ML-based GPU memory estimator framework for DL training
tasks, to minimize out-of-memory errors and introduces collocation policies
that cap GPU utilization to minimize interference. Furthermore, CARMA
introduces a recovery method to ensure robust restart of tasks that crash. Our
evaluation on traces modeled after real-world DL training task traces shows
that CARMA increases the GPU utilization over time by 39.3\%, decreases the
end-to-end execution time by $\sim$26.7\%, and reduces the GPU energy use by
$\sim$14.2\%.

Method: 采用第五代声明式语言(5GL)将项目需求形式化为机器可读的问题陈述，以96-Eyes项目（96相机并行多模态成像器）作为代表性案例进行研究。

Result: 声明式方法提高了设计透明度，确保了设计可追溯性，并最大限度地减少了跨团队的成本错配。该方法成功保留了来自不同领域利益相关者的关键任务输入。

Conclusion: 声明式问题表述能够促进并发研发工作流程环境中的创新，但需要认识到编程范式通过现有领域层次结构隐式地塑造研究工作流程，在实际采用中面临挑战。

Abstract: This article presents a practitioner's reflection on applying declarative,
5th generation, problem formulation language (5GL) to de novo imaging system
design, informed by experiences across the interdisciplinary research in
academia and cross-functional product development within the private sector.
Using the 96-Eyes project: 96-camera parallel multi-modal imager for
high-throughput drug discovery as a representative case, I illustrate how
project requirements, ranging from hardware constraints to life sciences needs,
can be formalized into machine-readable problem statements to preserve
mission-critical input from diverse domain stakeholders. This declarative
approach enhances transparency, ensures design traceability, and minimizes
costly misalignment across optical, algorithmic, hardware-accelerated compute,
and life sciences teams.
  Alongside the technical discussion of 5GL with real-world code examples, I
reflect on the practical barriers to adopting 5GL in environments where
imperative, 3rd-generation languages (3GL) remain the default medium for
inter-team collaboration. Rather than offering an one-size-fits-all solution,
these learned lessons highlight how programming paradigms implicitly shapes
research workflows through existing domain hierarchies. The discussion aims to
invite further explorations into how declarative problem formulations can
facilitate innovation in settings where concurrent R\&{}D workflows are gaining
traction, as opposed to environments where sequential, phase-driven workflows
remain the norm.

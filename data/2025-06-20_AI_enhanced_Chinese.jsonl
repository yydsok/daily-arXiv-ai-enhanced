Reference models, critical for accelerating the verification process, are themselves becoming more intricate and time-consuming to develop. Despite the promise shown by large language models (LLMs) in code programming, effectively generating complex reference models remains a significant hurdle. To address these challenges, we introduce ChatModel, the first LLM-aided agile reference model generation and verification platform. ChatModel streamlines the transition from design specifications to fully functional reference models by integrating design standardization and hierarchical agile modeling. Employing a building-block generation strategy, it not only enhances the design capabilities of LLMs for reference models but also significantly boosts verification efficiency. We evaluated ChatModel on 300 designs of varying complexity, demonstrating substantial improvements in both efficiency and quality of reference model generation. ChatModel achieved a peak performance improvement of 55.02% compared to alternative methods, with notable enhancements in generation stability, and delivered a 9.18x increase in its capacity to produce reference model designs. Furthermore, it accelerated the iterative process of reference model design and validation by an average of 5.90x compared to traditional approaches. These results highlight the potential of ChatModel to significantly advance the automation of reference model generation and validation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChatModel\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u654f\u6377\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "ChatModel\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u654f\u6377\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728300\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0cChatModel\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8655.02%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u53479.18\u500d\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a0\u901f5.90\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ChatModel\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, autonomous coordination in multi-satellite systems remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional optimisation approaches struggle to handle the real-time decision-making demands of dynamic EO missions, necessitating the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we investigate RL-based autonomous EO mission planning by modelling single-satellite operations and extending to multi-satellite constellations using MARL frameworks. We address key challenges, including energy and data storage limitations, uncertainties in satellite observations, and the complexities of decentralised coordination under partial observability. By leveraging a near-realistic satellite simulation environment, we evaluate the training stability and performance of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms, including PPO, IPPO, MAPPO, and HAPPO. Our results demonstrate that MARL can effectively balance imaging and resource management while addressing non-stationarity and reward interdependency in multi-satellite coordination.

Yet, existing agentic system generation frameworks lack full autonomy, missing from-scratch agent generation, self-optimizing agent functionality, and collaboration, limiting adaptability and scalability. We propose SwarmAgentic, a framework for fully automated agentic system generation that constructs agentic systems from scratch and jointly optimizes agent functionality and collaboration as interdependent components through language-driven exploration. To enable efficient search over system-level structures, SwarmAgentic maintains a population of candidate systems and evolves them via feedback-guided updates, drawing inspiration from Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). We evaluate our method on six real-world, open-ended, and exploratory tasks involving high-level planning, system-level coordination, and creative reasoning. Given only a task description and an objective function, SwarmAgentic outperforms all baselines, achieving a +261.8% relative improvement over ADAS on the TravelPlanner benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness of full automation in structurally unconstrained tasks.

CALM unites symbolic reasoning with neural generation, enabling systems to make context-sensitive decisions grounded in real-world multi-modal data.\n  Background: Classic bivalent logic systems cannot capture the nuance of human decision-making. They also require human grounding in multi-modal environments, which can be ad-hoc, rigid, and brittle. Neural networks are good at extracting rich contextual information from multi-modal data, but lack interpretable structures for reasoning.\n  Objectives: CALM aims to bridge the gap between logic and neural perception, creating an analog logic that can reason over multi-modal inputs. Without this integration, AI systems remain either brittle or unstructured, unable to generalize robustly to real-world tasks. In CALM, symbolic predicates evaluate to analog truth values computed by neural networks and constrained search.\n  Methods: CALM represents each predicate using a domain tree, which iteratively refines its analog truth value when the contextual groundings of its entities are determined. The iterative refinement is predicted by neural networks capable of capturing multi-modal information and is filtered through a symbolic reasoning module to ensure constraint satisfaction.\n  Results: In fill-in-the-blank object placement tasks, CALM achieved 92.2% accuracy, outperforming classical logic (86.3%) and LLM (59.4%) baselines. It also demonstrated spatial heatmap generation aligned with logical constraints and delicate human preferences, as shown by a human study.\n  Conclusions: CALM demonstrates the potential to reason with logic structure while aligning with preferences in multi-modal environments.

However, the limited spatial resolution in 360\u00b0 videos does not allow for each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360\u00b0 video signals. An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360\u00b0 video datasets for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360\u00b0 Video Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models to 360\u00b0 videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model for 360\u00b0 Video Super-Resolution (360\u00b0 VSR), called Spherical Signal Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360\u00b0~specific super-resolution models on 360\u00b0 video datasets.

The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings, e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species, anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio (Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the U.S. Forest Service to support population monitoring of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) and other forest owls (Lesmeister and Jenkins 2022; Ruff et al. 2020).

These gains allow for rapid closed-loop corrections around the current state without requiring full re-optimization at each timestep. We demonstrate the effectiveness of F-MPPI through simulations and real-world experiments on two robotic platforms: a quadrupedal robot performing dynamic locomotion on uneven terrain and a quadrotor executing aggressive maneuvers with onboard computation.

The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs-such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise as tools for supporting clinical decision-making, yet their typical one-shot or limited-interaction usage may overlook the complexities of real-world medical practice. In this work, we propose a hybrid human-AI framework, MedSyn, where physicians and LLMs engage in multi-step, interactive dialogues to refine diagnoses and treatment decisions. Unlike static decision-support tools, MedSyn enables dynamic exchanges, allowing physicians to challenge LLM suggestions while the LLM highlights alternative perspectives. Through simulated physician-LLM interactions, we assess the potential of open-source LLMs as physician assistants.

While prior research has introduced various deep learning models for this purpose, many struggle to balance noise suppression, perceptual quality, and speaker-specific feature preservation, leaving a critical research gap in their comparative performance evaluation. This study benchmarks three state-of-the-art models Wave-U-Net, CMGAN, and U-Net, on diverse datasets such as SpEAR, VPQAD, and Clarkson datasets. These models were chosen due to their relevance in the literature and code accessibility. The evaluation reveals that U-Net achieves high noise suppression with SNR improvements of +71.96% on SpEAR, +64.83% on VPQAD, and +364.2% on the Clarkson dataset. CMGAN outperforms in perceptual quality, attaining the highest PESQ scores of 4.04 on SpEAR and 1.46 on VPQAD, making it well-suited for applications prioritizing natural and intelligible speech.

During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance.

While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas.

As a crucial component for developing these reasoning models, reinforcement learning (RL), exemplified by Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its variants, allows models to learn through trial and error. However, PPO can be time-consuming due to its inherent on-policy nature, which is further exacerbated by increasing response lengths. In this work, we propose Truncated Proximal Policy Optimization (T-PPO), a novel extension to PPO that improves training efficiency by streamlining policy update and length-restricted response generation. T-PPO mitigates the issue of low hardware utilization, an inherent drawback of fully synchronized long-generation procedures, where resources often sit idle during the waiting periods for complete rollouts. Our contributions are two-folds. First, we propose Extended Generalized Advantage Estimation (EGAE) for advantage estimation derived from incomplete responses while maintaining the integrity of policy learning. Second, we devise a computationally optimized mechanism that allows for the independent optimization of the policy and value models.

While current robot programming tools (such as inverse kinematics, collision avoidance, and manipulation planning) often treat these problems as constrained optimization, many existing solvers focus on specific problem domains or do not exploit geometric constraints effectively. We propose an efficient first-order method, Augmented Lagrangian Spectral Projected Gradient Descent (ALSPG), which leverages geometric projections via Euclidean projections, Minkowski sums, and basis functions. We show that by using geometric constraints rather than full constraints and gradients, ALSPG significantly improves real-time performance. Compared to second-order methods like iLQR, ALSPG remains competitive in the unconstrained case. We validate our method through toy examples and extensive simulations, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a 7-axis Franka robot, a 6-axis P-Rob robot and a 1:10 scale car in real-world experiments.

However, existing methods often overlook a critical challenge: the credibility of context documents can vary widely, potentially leading to the propagation of unreliable information. In this paper, we introduce CrEst, a novel weakly supervised framework for assessing the credibility of context documents during LLM inference--without requiring manual annotations. Our approach is grounded in the insight that credible documents tend to exhibit higher semantic coherence with other credible documents, enabling automated credibility estimation through inter-document agreement. To incorporate credibility into LLM inference, we propose two integration strategies: a black-box approach for models without access to internal weights or activations, and a white-box method that directly modifies attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments across three model architectures and five datasets demonstrate that CrEst consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to a 26.86% improvement in accuracy and a 3.49% increase in F1 score.

We analyze two: DeepSeek-V3, a 671-billion-parameter Mixture of Experts large language model (LLM) exemplifying scale-driven generality, and NetraAI, a dynamical system-based framework engineered for stability and interpretability on small clinical trial datasets. We formalize NetraAI's foundations, combining contraction mappings, information geometry, and evolutionary algorithms to identify predictive patient cohorts. Features are embedded in a metric space and iteratively contracted toward stable attractors that define latent subgroups. A pseudo-temporal embedding and long-range memory enable exploration of higher-order feature interactions, while an internal evolutionary loop selects compact, explainable 2-4-variable bundles (\"Personas\").\n  To guide discovery, we introduce an LLM Strategist as a meta-evolutionary layer that observes Persona outputs, prioritizes promising variables, injects domain knowledge, and assesses robustness. This two-tier architecture mirrors the human scientific process: NetraAI as experimentalist, the LLM as theorist, forming a self-improving loop.\n  In case studies (schizophrenia, depression, pancreatic cancer), NetraAI uncovered small, high-effect-size subpopulations that transformed weak baseline models (AUC ~0.50-0.68) into near-perfect classifiers using only a few features. We position NetraAI at the intersection of dynamical systems, information geometry, and evolutionary learning, aligned with emerging concept-level reasoning paradigms such as LeCun's Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA).

We introduce \\textbf{HeurAgenix}, a two-stage hyper-heuristic framework powered by large language models (LLMs) that first evolves heuristics and then selects among them automatically. In the heuristic evolution phase, HeurAgenix leverages an LLM to compare seed heuristic solutions with higher-quality solutions and extract reusable evolution strategies. During problem solving, it dynamically picks the most promising heuristic for each problem state, guided by the LLM's perception ability. For flexibility, this selector can be either a state-of-the-art LLM or a fine-tuned lightweight model with lower inference cost. To mitigate the scarcity of reliable supervision caused by CO complexity, we fine-tune the lightweight heuristic selector with a dual-reward mechanism that jointly exploits singals from selection preferences and state perception, enabling robust selection under noisy annotations. Extensive experiments on canonical benchmarks show that HeurAgenix not only outperforms existing LLM-based hyper-heuristics but also matches or exceeds specialized solvers.

Federated Learning (FL) offers a solution by enabling collaborative model training without centralizing data. However, realizing FL for MLLMs presents significant challenges, including high computational demands, limited client capacity, substantial communication costs, and heterogeneous client data. Existing FL methods assume client-side deployment of full models, an assumption that breaks down for large-scale MLLMs due to their massive size and communication demands. To address these limitations, we propose FedNano, the first FL framework that centralizes the LLM on the server while introducing NanoEdge, a lightweight module for client-specific adaptation. NanoEdge employs modality-specific encoders, connectors, and trainable NanoAdapters with low-rank adaptation. This design eliminates the need to deploy LLM on clients, reducing client-side storage by 95%, and limiting communication overhead to only 0.01% of the model parameters. By transmitting only compact NanoAdapter updates, FedNano handles heterogeneous client data and resource constraints while preserving privacy.

The key contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model.

However, in-home meal assistance remains challenging due to the diversity of activities (e.g., eating, drinking, mouth wiping), contexts (e.g., socializing, watching TV), food items, and user preferences that arise during deployment. In this work, we propose FEAST, a flexible mealtime-assistance system that can be personalized in-the-wild to meet the unique needs of individual care recipients. Developed in collaboration with two community researchers and informed by a formative study with a diverse group of care recipients, our system is guided by three key tenets for in-the-wild personalization: adaptability, transparency, and safety. FEAST embodies these principles through: (i) modular hardware that enables switching between assisted feeding, drinking, and mouth-wiping, (ii) diverse interaction methods, including a web interface, head gestures, and physical buttons, to accommodate diverse functional abilities and preferences, and (iii) parameterized behavior trees that can be safely and transparently adapted using a large language model. We evaluate our system based on the personalization requirements identified in our formative study, demonstrating that FEAST offers a wide range of transparent and safe adaptations and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline limited to fixed customizations. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we conduct an in-home user study with two care recipients (who are community researchers), feeding them three meals each across three diverse scenarios. We further assess FEAST's ecological validity by evaluating with an Occupational Therapist previously unfamiliar with the system.

New evaluation benchmarks are of increasing priority as the reasoning capabilities of LLMs are expanding at a rapid pace. In particular, while multi-document (MD) reasoning is an area of extreme relevance given LLM capabilities in handling longer-context inputs, few benchmarks exist to rigorously examine model behavior in this setting. Moreover, the multi-document setting is historically challenging for benchmark creation due to the expensive cost of annotating long inputs. In this work, we introduce MDBench, a new dataset for evaluating LLMs on the task of multi-document reasoning. Notably, MDBench is created through a novel synthetic generation process, allowing us to controllably and efficiently generate challenging document sets and the corresponding question-answer (QA) examples. Our novel technique operates on condensed structured seed knowledge, modifying it through LLM-assisted edits to induce MD-specific reasoning challenges. We then convert this structured knowledge into a natural text surface form, generating a document set and corresponding QA example. We analyze the behavior of popular LLMs and prompting techniques, finding that MDBENCH poses significant challenges for all methods, even with relatively short document sets.

One of the major challenges in ALT is the high amplitude of interfering audio signals relative to conventional ASR due to musical accompaniment. Recent advances in music source separation have enabled automatic extraction of high-quality separated vocals, which could potentially improve ALT performance. However, the effect of source separation has not been systematically investigated in order to establish best practices for its use. This work examines the impact of source separation on ALT using Whisper, a state-of-the-art open source ASR model. We evaluate Whisper's performance on original audio, separated vocals, and vocal stems across short-form and long-form transcription tasks. For short-form, we suggest a concatenation method that results in a consistent reduction in Word Error Rate (WER). For long-form, we propose an algorithm using source separation as a vocal activity detector to derive segment boundaries, which results in a consistent reduction in WER relative to Whisper's native long-form algorithm. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for an open source system on the Jam-ALT long-form ALT benchmark, without any training or fine-tuning.

Achieving autonomous operation requires systems to navigate safely through complex and unfamiliar environments. This level of autonomy is particularly challenging due to the complexity of such environments and the need for real-time decision making especially for platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP), which limits flight time and precludes the use of bulky sensors like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) for mapping. Furthermore, computing globally optimal, collision-free paths and translating them into time-optimized, safe trajectories in real time adds significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we present a fully onboard, real-time navigation system that relies solely on lightweight onboard sensors. Our system constructs a dense 3D map of the environment using a novel visual depth estimation approach that fuses stereo and monocular learning-based depth, yielding longer-range, denser, and less noisy depth maps than conventional stereo methods. Building on this map, we introduce a novel planning and trajectory generation framework capable of rapidly computing time-optimal global trajectories.

We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer for 3D Gaussian Splating-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarse-grained attention at higher layers models object-level topology.

We conduct an empirical analysis using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database (PIDD). We evaluate six LLMs, including four open-source models: Gemma-2-27B, Mistral-7B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Llama-3.2-2B. We also test two proprietary models: GPT-4o and Gemini Flash 2.0. In addition, we compare their performance with three traditional machine learning models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Our results show that proprietary LLMs perform better than open-source ones, with GPT-4o and Gemma-2-27B achieving the highest accuracy in few-shot settings. Notably, Gemma-2-27B also outperforms the traditional ML models in terms of F1-score.

These parameters have traditionally been predicted via direct measurements which might lead to challenges in case of sensor faults. Alternatively, a data-driven prediction model based on surface pressure data can be used to determine these parameters. It is essential that such predictors achieve close to real-time learning as dictated by practical applications such as monitoring wind tunnel operations or learning the variations in aerodynamic performance of aerospace and wind energy systems. To overcome the challenges caused by changes in the data distribution as well as in adapting to a new prediction task, we propose a transfer learning methodology to predict the onflow parameters, specifically angle of attack and onflow speed. It requires first training a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model offline for the core prediction task, then freezing the weights of this model except the selected layers preceding the output node, and finally executing transfer learning by retraining these layers. A demonstration of this approach is provided using steady CFD analysis data for an airfoil for i) domain adaptation where transfer learning is performed with data from a target domain having different data distribution than the source domain and ii) task adaptation where the prediction task is changed. Further exploration on the influence of noisy data, performance on an extended domain, and trade studies varying sampling sizes and architectures are provided.

In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. \nBy converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG).

While existing approaches attempt to address this challenge through module-specific optimizations or pre-defined complexity levels, they lack comprehensive control over computational complexity. We present ABC (Adaptive BayesNet structure learning for computational scalable multi-task image Compression), a novel, comprehensive framework that achieves computational scalability across all NIC components through Bayesian network (BayesNet) structure learning. ABC introduces three key innovations: (i) a heterogeneous bipartite BayesNet (inter-node structure) for managing neural backbone computations; (ii) a homogeneous multipartite BayesNet (intra-node structure) for optimizing autoregressive unit processing; and (iii) an adaptive control module that dynamically adjusts the BayesNet structure based on device capabilities, input data complexity, and downstream task requirements. Experiments demonstrate that ABC enables full computational scalability with better complexity adaptivity and broader complexity control span, while maintaining competitive compression performance. Furthermore, the framework's versatility allows integration with various NIC architectures that employ BayesNet representations, making it a robust solution for ensuring computational scalability in NIC applications.

However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge.

In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre.

Although advancements in robotic autonomy, operating by human remains essential in complex aerial environments. Existing teleoperation approaches for multirotors fail to fully leverage the additional DoFs provided by omnidirectional rotation. Additionally, the dexterity of human fingers should be exploited for more engaged interaction. In this work, we propose an aerial teleoperation system that brings the omnidirectionality of human hands into the unbounded aerial workspace. Our system includes two motion-tracking marker sets -- one on the shoulder and one on the hand -- along with a data glove to capture hand gestures. Using these inputs, we design four interaction modes for different tasks, including Spherical Mode and Cartesian Mode for long-range moving as well as Operation Mode and Locking Mode for precise manipulation, where the hand gestures are utilized for seamless mode switching. We evaluate our system on a valve-turning task in real world, demonstrating how each mode contributes to effective aerial manipulation.

To address this critical gap, we introduce DAVID-X, the first dataset to pair AI-generated videos with detailed defect-level, temporal-spatial annotations and written rationales. Leveraging these rich annotations, we present DAVID-XR1, a video-language model designed to deliver an interpretable chain of visual reasoning-including defect categorization, temporal-spatial localization, and natural language explanations. This approach fundamentally transforms AI-generated video detection from an opaque black-box decision into a transparent and verifiable diagnostic process.

However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data, such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over prior works.

This limitation mainly stems from the underutilization of internal network features and the absence of video-specific considerations in network design. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion framework, MSNeRV, for neural video representation. In the encoding stage, we enhance temporal consistency by employing temporal windows, and divide the video into multiple Groups of Pictures (GoPs), where a GoP-level grid is used for background representation. Additionally, we design a multi-scale spatial decoder with a scale-adaptive loss function to integrate multi-resolution and multi-frequency information. To further improve feature extraction, we introduce a multi-scale feature block that fully leverages hidden features.

Traditional methods typically treat each new context as a separate task with its own reward function. For example, if a previously ignored stove becomes too hot to be around, the robot must learn a new reward from scratch, even though the underlying preference for prioritizing safety over efficiency remains unchanged. We observe that context influences not the underlying preference itself, but rather the $\\textit{saliency}$--or importance--of reward features. For instance, stove heat affects the importance of the robot's proximity, yet the human's safety preference stays the same. Existing multi-task and meta IRL methods learn context-dependent representations $\\textit{implicitly}$--without distinguishing between preferences and feature importance--resulting in substantial data requirements. Instead, we propose $\\textit{explicitly}$ modeling context-invariant preferences separately from context-dependent feature saliency, creating modular reward representations that adapt to new contexts. To achieve this, we introduce $\\textit{calibrated features}$--representations that capture contextual effects on feature saliency--and present specialized paired comparison queries that isolate saliency from preference for efficient learning. Experiments with simulated users show our method significantly improves sample efficiency, requiring 10x fewer preference queries than baselines to achieve equivalent reward accuracy, with up to 15% better performance in low-data regimes (5-10 queries).

Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems.\n  In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f02\u6784\u7269\u54c1\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5feb\u901f\u914d\u9001\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\u4fc3\u4f7f\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u901a\u9053\u5835\u585e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u548cTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u54c1\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u4ed3\u5e93\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs.

Conventional TTS training pipelines require well-curated corpora with high acoustic quality and accurate text-speech alignment, which severely limits scalability, speaker diversity, and real-world applicability. While recent studies have proposed acoustic-quality-based data selection techniques, they often overlook two critical aspects: (1) the inherent robustness of modern TTS models to noise, and (2) the potential contribution of perceptually low-quality yet informative samples. To address these issues, TTSOps introduces a data-centric training pipeline that integrates three core components: (1) automated data collection from dark data sources, (2) utterance-level dynamic selection of data cleansing methods based on training data quality, and (3) evaluation-in-the-loop data selection using automatically predicted mean opinion scores (MOS) to estimate each utterance's impact on model performance. Furthermore, TTSOps jointly optimizes the corpus and the TTS model in a closed-loop framework by dynamically adapting both data selection and data cleansing processes to the characteristics of the target TTS model. Extensive experiments on Japanese YouTube data demonstrate that TTSOps outperforms conventional acoustic-quality-based baselines in both the naturalness and speaker diversity of synthesized speech.", "AI": {"tldr": "TTSOps\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u95ed\u73af\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u3001\u672a\u7ecf\u6574\u7406\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5728\u7ebf\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u6587\u672c\u8f6c\u8bed\u97f3\uff08TTS\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfTTS\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002TTSOps\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3TTS\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "TTSOps\u7ed3\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bMOS\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e5\u8bedYouTube\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTTSOps\u5728\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u548c\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TTSOps\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u548cTTS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

While this assumption is harmless to make in some situations, it can be inefficient or even infeasible in others. In this paper, we consider assigning multi-robot tasks to multitasking robots. The key contribution is a novel task allocation framework that incorporates the consideration of physical constraints introduced by multitasking. This is in contrast to the existing work where such constraints are largely ignored. After formulating the problem, we propose a compilation to weighted MAX-SAT, which allows us to leverage existing solvers for a solution. A more efficient greedy heuristic is then introduced. For evaluation, we first compare our methods with a modern baseline that is efficient for single-tasking robots to validate the benefits of multitasking in synthetic domains. Then, using a site-clearing scenario in simulation, we further illustrate the complex task interaction considered by the multitasking robots in our approach to demonstrate its performance. Finally, we demonstrate a physical experiment to show how multitasking enabled by our approach can benefit task efficiency in a realistic setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743MAX-SAT\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743MAX-SAT\u7f16\u8bd1\u548c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing methods often miss key aspects like coherence, style, or relevance, or are biased by pretraining data, making open-ended long-form evaluation an underexplored problem. To address this gap, we propose PrefBERT, a scoring model for evaluating open-ended long-form generation in GRPO and guiding its training with distinct rewards for good and bad outputs. Trained on two response evaluation datasets with diverse long-form styles and Likert-rated quality, PrefBERT effectively supports GRPO by offering better semantic reward feedback than traditional metrics ROUGE-L and BERTScore do. Through comprehensive evaluations, including LLM-as-a-judge, human ratings, and qualitative analysis, we show that PrefBERT, trained on multi-sentence and paragraph-length responses, remains reliable across varied long passages and aligns well with the verifiable rewards GRPO needs. Human evaluations confirm that using PrefBERT as the reward signal to train policy models yields responses better aligned with human preferences than those trained with traditional metrics.

We present a unifying framework for systematically constructing natural language \"state\" representations for prompting LLM agents in repeated multi-agent games. Previous work on games with LLM agents has taken an ad hoc approach to encoding game history, which not only obscures the impact of state representation on agents' behavior, but also limits comparability between studies. Our framework addresses these gaps by characterizing methods of state representation along three axes: action informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation captures actions played); reward informativeness (i.e., the extent to which the state representation describes rewards obtained); and prompting style (or natural language compression, i.e., the extent to which the full text history is summarized).\n  We apply this framework to a dynamic selfish routing game, chosen because it admits a simple equilibrium both in theory and in human subject experiments \\cite{rapoport_choice_2009}. Despite the game's relative simplicity, we find that there are key dependencies of LLM agent behavior on the natural language state representation. In particular, we observe that representations which provide agents with (1) summarized, rather than complete, natural language representations of past history; (2) information about regrets, rather than raw payoffs; and (3) limited information about others' actions lead to behavior that more closely matches game theoretic equilibrium predictions, and with more stable game play by the agents. By contrast, other representations can exhibit either large deviations from equilibrium, higher variation in dynamic game play over time, or both.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u201c\u72b6\u6001\u201d\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u91cd\u590d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u63d0\u793aLLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u98ce\u683c\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u81ea\u79c1\u8def\u7531\u6e38\u620f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u603b\u7ed3\u6027\u5386\u53f2\u8868\u793a\u3001\u540e\u6094\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u539f\u59cb\u6536\u76ca\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u9650\u4ed6\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5747\u8861\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u6e38\u620f\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5bf9LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u79bb\u5747\u8861\u6216\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002"}}

We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic 3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark, which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation, shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain intelligence.

To appear in the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS)", "summary": "The Audio Mostly (AM) conference has long been a platform for exploring the intersection of sound, technology, and culture. Despite growing interest in sonic cultures, discussions on the role of cultural diversity in sound design and sonification remain limited. This paper investigates the implicit biases and gaps within the discourse on music and sound aesthetics, challenging the notion of music as a 'universal language'. Through a historical and cross-cultural analysis of musicology and ethnomusicology, the profound influence of cultural context on auditory perception and aesthetic appraisal is highlighted. By drawing parallels between historical music practices and contemporary sound design, the paper advocates for a more inclusive approach that recognizes the diversity of sonic traditions. Using music as a case study, we underscore broader implications for sound design and sonification, emphasizing the need to integrate cultural perspectives into auditory design practices. A reevaluation of existing frameworks in sound design and sonification is proposed, emphasizing the necessity of culturally informed practices that resonate with global audiences.

Although social robots tend to be deployed with ``expressive'' joyful voices, they lack this long-term variation found in human speech.

We present EmojiVoice, a free, customizable text-to-speech (TTS) toolkit that allows social roboticists to build temporally variable, expressive speech on social robots. We introduce emoji-prompting to allow fine-grained control of expressivity on a phase level and use the lightweight Matcha-TTS backbone to generate speech in real-time. We explore three case studies: (1) a scripted conversation with a robot assistant, (2) a storytelling robot, and (3) an autonomous speech-to-speech interactive agent.

As time progresses, concept drift occurs and previously encountered concepts are forgotten, thereby leading to a decline in the accuracy of online predictions. Existing solutions employ parameter updating techniques to delay forgetting; however, this may result in the loss of some previously learned knowledge while neglecting the exploration of knowledge retention mechanisms. To retain all conceptual knowledge and fully utilize it when the concepts recur, we propose the Continuous Evolution Pool (CEP), a pooling mechanism that stores different instances of forecasters for different concepts. Our method first selects the forecaster nearest to the test sample and then learns the features from its neighboring samples - a process we refer to as the retrieval. If there are insufficient neighboring samples, it indicates that a new concept has emerged, and a new model will evolve from the current nearest sample to the pool to store the knowledge of the concept.

Given that language is a verbal task, this gap may have severe consequences for the effectiveness of robots for language teaching tasks. We address this lack of L2 teaching robot voices through three contributions: 1. We address the need for a lightweight and expressive robot voice. Using a fine-tuned version of Matcha-TTS, we use emoji prompting to create an expressive voice that shows a range of expressivity over time. The voice can run in real time with limited compute resources. Through case studies, we found this voice more expressive, socially appropriate, and suitable for long periods of expressive speech, such as storytelling. 2. We explore how to adapt a robot's voice to physical and social ambient environments to deploy our voices in various locations. We found that increasing pitch and pitch rate in noisy and high-energy environments makes the robot's voice appear more appropriate and makes it seem more aware of its current environment. 3. We create an English TTS system with improved clarity for L2 listeners using known linguistic properties of vowels that are difficult for these listeners. We used a data-driven, perception-based approach to understand how L2 speakers use duration cues to interpret challenging words with minimal tense (long) and lax (short) vowels in English. We found that the duration of vowels strongly influences the perception for L2 listeners and created an \"L2 clarity mode\" for Matcha-TTS that applies a lengthening to tense vowels while leaving lax vowels unchanged. Our clarity mode was found to be more respectful, intelligible, and encouraging than base Matcha-TTS while reducing transcription errors in these challenging tense/lax minimal pairs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9L2\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528Matcha-TTS\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u7b26\u53f7\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\uff1b2. \u6839\u636e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u97f3\uff1b3. \u4e3aL2\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5143\u97f3\u65f6\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u8bed\u97f3\u66f4\u751f\u52a8\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u4f7f\u8bed\u97f3\u66f4\u8d34\u5408\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86L2\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u529b\u548c\u79ef\u6781\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6559\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While DETR-like architectures offer a powerful paradigm, their direct application in this domain encounters inherent limitations, preventing optimal performance. Our work addresses these challenges by introducing MonoVQD, a novel framework designed to fundamentally advance DETR-based monocular 3D detection. We propose three main contributions. First, we propose the Mask Separated Self-Attention mechanism that enables the integration of the denoising process into a DETR architecture. This improves the stability of Hungarian matching to achieve a consistent optimization objective. Second, we present the Variational Query Denoising technique to address the gradient vanishing problem of conventional denoising methods, which severely restricts the efficiency of the denoising process. This explicitly introduces stochastic properties to mitigate this fundamental limitation and unlock substantial performance gains.

However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements.

While they have achieved impressive results on various vision tasks, their performance on chart-to-code generation remains suboptimal. This task requires MLLMs to generate executable code that can reproduce a given chart, demanding not only precise visual understanding but also accurate translation of visual elements into structured code. Directly prompting MLLMs to perform this complex task often yields unsatisfactory results. To address this challenge, we propose {ChartIR}, an iterative refinement method based on structured instruction. First, we distinguish two tasks: visual understanding and code translation. To accomplish the visual understanding component, we design two types of structured instructions: description and difference. The description instruction captures the visual elements of the reference chart, while the difference instruction characterizes the discrepancies between the reference chart and the generated chart.

However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

Despite prior research showing that modeling this property boosts response diversity, most modern LLM-based dialogue agents do not explicitly do so. In this work, we model the o2m property of OD in LLMs by decomposing OD generation into two key tasks: Multi-Response Generation (MRG) and Preference-based Selection (PS), which entail generating a set of n semantically and lexically diverse high-quality responses for a given dialogue context, followed by selecting a single response based on human preference, respectively. To facilitate MRG and PS, we introduce o2mDial, a dialogue corpus explicitly designed to capture the o2m property by featuring multiple plausible responses for each context. Leveraging o2mDial, we propose new in-context learning and instruction-tuning strategies, as well as novel evaluation metrics for MRG, alongside a model-based approach for PS. Empirical results demonstrate that applying the proposed two-stage framework to smaller LLMs for OD generation enhances overall response diversity while maintaining contextual coherence, improving response quality by up to 90%, bringing them closer to the performance of larger models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff08MRG\u548cPS\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6o2mDial\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709LLM\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6b64\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u54cd\u5e94\u751f\u6210\uff08MRG\uff09\u548c\u504f\u597d\u9009\u62e9\uff08PS\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165o2mDial\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe90%\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e00\u5bf9\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We expose a fundamental limit on this tradeoff. For any model whose representational similarity between inputs decays with finite semantic resolution $\\varepsilon$, we derive closed-form expressions that pin its probability of correct generalization $p_S$ and identification $p_I$ to a universal Pareto front independent of input space geometry. Extending the analysis to noisy, heterogeneous spaces and to $n>2$ inputs predicts a sharp $1/n$ collapse of multi-input processing capacity and a non-monotonic optimum for $p_S$. A minimal ReLU network trained end-to-end reproduces these laws: during learning a resolution boundary self-organizes and empirical $(p_S,p_I)$ trajectories closely follow theoretical curves for linearly decaying similarity. Finally, we demonstrate that the same limits persist in two markedly more complex settings -- a convolutional neural network and state-of-the-art vision-language models -- confirming that finite-resolution similarity is a fundamental emergent informational constraint, not merely a toy-model artifact.

However, their large size often leads to noticeable latency between the end of user input and the start of audio output, resulting in suboptimal user experiences. This latency is particularly evident when LLMs are deployed as single-user voice assistants on consumer-grade hardware with limited computing capacity. We discovered that this latency is primarily dominated by the time it takes for the LLMs to generate the first sentence, which is required as input by the TTS systems that synthesize audio responses on a sentence-by-sentence basis. To address this bottleneck, we propose Predictive Generation (PredGen), a novel framework that mitigates-or even eliminates-this delay through speculative decoding at input time. PredGen generates candidate responses while the user is still speaking, enabling the system to begin TTS processing with minimal delay. Simulated experiments on the Lmsys and MT-Bench datasets show that the proposed method can effectively reduce the latency by around 2x across a wide range of use cases, while incurring only minimal additional computation cost at input time-computation that would otherwise go unused.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faPredictive Generation (PredGen)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u804a\u5929\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u804a\u5929\u4e2d\u56e0\u751f\u6210\u9996\u53e5\u8017\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPredGen\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u65f6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f2\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9884\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11TTS\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Lmsys\u548cMT-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62\u500d\uff0c\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "PredGen\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u97f3\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we first propose leveraging a low-cost single-beam sonar to improve scale estimation. Then, VIMS integrates a high-sampling-rate magnetometer for place recognition by utilizing magnetic signatures generated by an economical magnetic field coil. Building on this, a hierarchical scheme is developed for visual-magnetic place recognition, enabling robust loop closure.

BKSEF balances information gain, computational efficiency, and accuracy improvements by integrating principles from information theory, signal processing, and learning theory. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-lite, ChestX-ray14, and GTSRB datasets demonstrate that BKSEF-guided architectures achieve up to 3.1 percent accuracy improvement and 42.8 percent reduction in FLOPs compared to traditional models using uniform 3x3 kernels. Two real-world case studies further validate the approach: one for medical image classification in a cloud-based setup, and another for traffic sign recognition on edge devices. The former achieved enhanced interpretability and accuracy, while the latter reduced latency and model size significantly, with minimal accuracy trade-off. These results show that kernel size can be an active, optimizable parameter rather than a fixed heuristic.

These techniques increase the average token length, thus lowering fertility while preserving linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that Thunder-Tok reduces fertility by approximately 10% (i.e., reduces the number of tokens by 10%, improving the inference speed by 10%) compared to BPE without compromising performance across various downstream tasks. These findings demonstrate that our linguistically informed approach is effective and practical for designing efficient tokenizers for language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Thunder-Tok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u97e9\u8bed\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11token\u6570\u91cf\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u9884\u5206\u8bcd\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u652f\u71b5\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u97e9\u8bed\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11token\u6570\u91cf\uff08\u964d\u4f4efertility\uff09\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89c4\u5219\u9884\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u97e9\u8bed\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u652f\u71b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u8bcd\u6c47\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cThunder-Tok\u6bd4BPE\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea610%\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea610%\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u3002"}}

Our method leverages deep neural networks to learn discriminative features by embedding video frames and incorporating object detection-based techniques tailored for retail environments. Experimental results showcase the superiority of our approach over traditional methods, achieving accuracy comparable to human annotator labeling while enhancing the overall efficiency of retail video annotation. Remarkably, our approach leads to an average of 2 times cost savings in video annotation. By allowing human annotators to verify/adjust less than 5% of detected frames in the video dataset, while automating the annotation process for the remaining frames without reducing annotation quality, retailers can significantly reduce operational costs.

Applying structured recall tasks to the Mamba architecture, we observe a consistent U-shaped accuracy profile, indicating strong performance at the beginning and end of input sequences. We identify three mechanisms that give rise to this pattern. First, long-term memory is supported by a sparse subset of channels within the model's selective state space block, which persistently encode early input tokens and are causally linked to primacy effects. Second, short-term memory is governed by delta-modulated recurrence: recent inputs receive more weight due to exponential decay, but this recency advantage collapses when distractor items are introduced, revealing a clear limit to memory depth. Third, we find that memory allocation is dynamically modulated by semantic regularity: repeated relations in the input sequence shift the delta gating behavior, increasing the tendency to forget intermediate items. We validate these findings via targeted ablations and input perturbations on two large-scale Mamba-based language models: one with 1.4B and another with 7B parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\u63ed\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5728Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230U\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u9053\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d7delta\u8c03\u5236\u9012\u5f52\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5206\u914d\u53d7\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5f8b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5728Mamba\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u56de\u5fc6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u9996\u56e0\u548c\u8fd1\u56e0\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u6d88\u878d\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7531\u7a00\u758f\u901a\u9053\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d7delta\u8c03\u5236\u9012\u5f52\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5206\u914d\u53d7\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5f8b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Investigating continuous differential equations has been a promising approach for studying the discrete optimization methods.

In this work, we study the HB momentum method in continuous time while putting more focus on the discretization error to provide additional theoretical tools to this area. In particular, we design a first-order piece-wise continuous differential equation, where we add a number of counter terms to account for the discretization error explicitly. As a result, we provide a continuous time model for the HB momentum method that allows the control of discretization error to arbitrary order of the step size.

Under review for NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods.

Additionally, large language models (LLMs) have recently proven indispensable for many natural language processing tasks, including text classification, thanks to their ability to recognize complex linguistic patterns and semantics. This study analyzes various proprietary and open-source LLMs for a single-label, multi-class text classification task focused on the SDGs. Then, it also evaluates the effectiveness of task adaptation techniques (i.e., in-context learning approaches), namely Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning, as well as Fine-Tuning within this domain.

VLMs integrate visual modalities with large language models (LLMs), which are well known to be prompt-sensitive.

We therefore investigate which prompt variations VLMs are most sensitive to and which VLMs are most agnostic to prompt variations. To this end, we introduce PARC (Prompt Analysis via Reliability and Calibration), a VLM prompt sensitivity analysis framework built on three pillars: (1) plausible prompt variations in both the language and vision domain, (2) a novel model reliability score with built-in guarantees, and (3) a calibration step that enables dataset- and prompt-spanning prompt variation analysis. Regarding prompt variations, PARC's evaluation shows that VLMs mirror LLM language prompt sensitivity in the vision domain, and most destructive variations change the expected answer.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), prominent in large language models (LLMs), is extending its influence to T2I systems. This paper introduces DPO-Kernels for T2I models, a novel extension enhancing alignment across three dimensions: (i) Hybrid Loss, integrating embedding-based objectives with traditional probability-based loss for improved optimization; (ii) Kernelized Representations, employing Radial Basis Function (RBF), Polynomial, and Wavelet kernels for richer feature transformations and better separation between safe and unsafe inputs; and (iii) Divergence Selection, expanding beyond DPO's default Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularizer by incorporating Wasserstein and R'enyi divergences for enhanced stability and robustness. We introduce DETONATE, the first large-scale benchmark of its kind, comprising approximately 100K curated image pairs categorized as chosen and rejected. DETONATE encapsulates three axes of social bias and discrimination: Race, Gender, and Disability. Prompts are sourced from hate speech datasets, with images generated by leading T2I models including Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Diffusion XL, and Midjourney.

These prototypes minimize the nuances of the representation, revealing that seemingly diverse tasks are grounded in shared reasoning structures.Based on this hypothesis, we propose ProtoReasoning, a framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs by leveraging scalable and verifiable prototypical representations (Prolog for logical reasoning, PDDL for planning).ProtoReasoning features: (1) an automated prototype construction pipeline that transforms problems into corresponding prototype representations; (2) a comprehensive verification system providing reliable feedback through Prolog/PDDL interpreters; (3) the scalability to synthesize problems arbitrarily within prototype space while ensuring correctness. Extensive experiments show that ProtoReasoning achieves 4.7% improvement over baseline models on logical reasoning (Enigmata-Eval), 6.3% improvement on planning tasks, 4.0% improvement on general reasoning (MMLU) and 1.0% on mathematics (AIME24).

Recently, a variant of IL, called In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Compared to closed-ended QA, it demands longer answer statements, more nuanced reasoning processes, and diverse expressions, making refined and interpretable automatic evaluation both crucial and challenging. Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore struggle to capture semantic similarities due to different patterns between model responses and reference answers. Current LLM-based evaluation approaches, such as pairwise or listwise comparisons of candidate answers, lack intuitive interpretability. While pointwise scoring of each response provides some descriptions, it fails to adapt across different question contents. Most notably, existing methods overlook the distinction between factoid and non-factoid questions. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{MinosEval}, a novel evaluation method that first distinguishes open-ended questions and then ranks candidate answers using different evaluation strategies. For factoid questions, it applies an adaptive key-point scoring strategy, while for non-factoid questions, it uses an instance-aware listwise ranking strategy. Experiments on multiple open-ended QA datasets, including self-built ones with more candidate responses to complement community resources, show that MinosEval better aligns with human annotations and offers more interpretable results.", "AI": {"tldr": "MinosEval\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u56de\u7b54\uff08QA\uff09\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u3001\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982ROUGE\u548cBERTScore\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u89c2\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e14\u672a\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "MinosEval\u9996\u5148\u533a\u5206\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u524d\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u653eQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMinosEval\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MinosEval\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f00\u653eQA\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Current evaluations of Explainable AI (XAI) often prioritize technical fidelity over cognitive accessibility which critically affects users, in particular those with visual impairments. We propose CUE, a model for Cognitive Understanding of Explanations, linking explanation properties to cognitive sub-processes: legibility (perception), readability (comprehension), and interpretability (interpretation). In a study (N=455) testing heatmaps with varying colormaps (BWR, Cividis, Coolwarm), we found comparable task performance but lower confidence/effort for visually impaired users. Unlike expected, these gaps were not mitigated and sometimes worsened by accessibility-focused color maps like Cividis. These results challenge assumptions about perceptual optimization and support the need for adaptive XAI interfaces. They also validate CUE by demonstrating that altering explanation legibility affects understandability.

Membership Inference Attack (MIA) has emerged as a potential approach to determine if a specific image was used to train a diffusion model, thus quantifying privacy risks. Existing MIA methods often rely on diffusion reconstruction errors, where member images are expected to have lower reconstruction errors than non-member images. However, applying these methods directly to medical images faces challenges. Reconstruction error is influenced by inherent image difficulty, and diffusion models struggle with high-frequency detail reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a Frequency-Calibrated Reconstruction Error (FCRE) method for MIAs on medical image diffusion models. By focusing on reconstruction errors within a specific mid-frequency range and excluding both high-frequency (difficult to reconstruct) and low-frequency (less informative) regions, our frequency-selective approach mitigates the confounding factor of inherent image difficulty.

The experimental protocols are translated into a composite architecture of generic views and modules, which offers a lot of flexibility. The architecture is defined in a structured configuration file, so that protocols can be implemented with minimal programming skills.

However, in complex environments, the number of objects to potentially interact with is vast, and their physical properties are often uncertain. This complexity makes it infeasible to employ a single global model. Therefore, we need to resort to online system identification of context-aware models that capture only the currently relevant aspects of the environment. While physical principles such as the conservation of energy may not hold across varying contexts, ensuring physical plausibility for any individual context-aware model can still be highly desirable, particularly when using it for receding horizon control methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). Hence, in this work, we extend DeLaN to make it context-aware, combine it with a recurrent network for online system identification, and integrate it with a MPC for adaptive, physics-informed control. We also combine DeLaN with a residual dynamics model to leverage the fact that a nominal model of the robot is typically available.

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data.

Currently, researchers rely on Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure these metrics; however, DXA scans are costly and time-consuming. This work proposes an alternative to DXA scans by applying statistical and machine learning models on biomarkers (height, volume, left calf circumference, etc) obtained from 3D optical images. The dataset consists of 847 patients and was sourced from Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Extracting patients' data in healthcare faces many technical challenges and legal restrictions. However, most supervised machine learning algorithms are inherently data-intensive, requiring a large amount of training data. To overcome these limitations, we implemented a semi-supervised model, the $p$-Laplacian regression model. This paper is the first to demonstrate the application of a $p$-Laplacian model for regression. Our $p$-Laplacian model yielded errors of $\\sim13\\%$ for ALM, $\\sim10\\%$ for BMD, and $\\sim20\\%$ for BFP when the training data accounted for 10 percent of all data. Among the supervised algorithms we implemented, Support Vector Regression (SVR) performed the best for ALM and BMD, yielding errors of $\\sim 8\\%$ for both, while Least Squares SVR performed the best for BFP with $\\sim 11\\%$ error when trained on 80 percent of the data.

It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems.

However, text extraction from historical maps is challenging due to the lack of (1) effective methods and (2) training data. Previous approaches use ad-hoc steps tailored to only specific map styles. Recent machine learning-based text spotters (e.g., for scene images) have the potential to solve these challenges because of their flexibility in supporting various types of text instances. However, these methods remain challenges in extracting precise image features for predicting every sub-component (boundary points and characters) in a text instance. This is critical because map text can be lengthy and highly rotated with complex backgrounds, posing difficulties in detecting relevant image features from a rough text region. This paper proposes PALETTE, an end-to-end text spotter for scanned historical maps of a wide variety. PALETTE introduces a novel hyper-local sampling module to explicitly learn localized image features around the target boundary points and characters of a text instance for detection and recognition. PALETTE also enables hyper-local positional embeddings to learn spatial interactions between boundary points and characters within and across text instances. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach to automatically generate synthetic map images, SynthMap+, for training text spotters for historical maps. The experiment shows that PALETTE with SynthMap+ outperforms SOTA text spotters on two new benchmark datasets of historical maps, particularly for long and angled text. We have deployed PALETTE with SynthMap+ to process over 60,000 maps in the David Rumsey Historical Map collection and generated over 100 million text labels to support map searching.

This framework is designed to revolutionize the field by enabling artist level style transfer and text driven stylization. First, we propose a semantic-based style injection method that uses BLIP to generate text descriptions strictly aligned with the semantics of the style image in CLIP space. By leveraging a large language model to remove style-related descriptions from these descriptions, we create a semantic gap. This gap is then used to fine-tune the model, enabling efficient and drift-free injection of style knowledge. Second, we propose a data augmentation strategy based on human feedback, incorporating high-quality samples generated early in the fine-tuning process into the training set to facilitate progressive learning and significantly reduce its overfitting. Finally, we design a training-free triple diffusion process using the fine-tuned model, which manipulates the features of self-attention layers in a manner similar to the cross-attention mechanism. Specifically, in the generation process, the key and value of the content-related process are replaced with those of the style-related process to inject style while maintaining text control over the model. We also introduce query preservation to mitigate disruptions to the original content. Under such a design, we have achieved high-quality image-driven style transfer and text-driven stylization, delivering artist-level style transfer results while preserving the original image content.

However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent, and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition using scene-level descriptors.

Two critical issues in existing vector quantization methods are training instability and codebook collapse. Training instability arises from the gradient discrepancy introduced by the straight-through estimator, especially in the presence of significant quantization errors, while codebook collapse occurs when only a small subset of code vectors are utilized during training. A closer examination of these issues reveals that they are primarily driven by a mismatch between the distributions of the features and code vectors, leading to unrepresentative code vectors and significant data information loss during compression. To address this, we employ the Wasserstein distance to align these two distributions, achieving near 100\\% codebook utilization and significantly reducing the quantization error.

In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal surfing aquatic-aerial vehicle, SurfAAV, which efficiently integrates underwater navigation, surface gliding, and aerial flying capabilities. Thanks to the design of the novel differential thrust vectoring hydrofoil, SurfAAV can achieve efficient surface gliding and underwater navigation without the need for a buoyancy adjustment system. This design provides flexible operational capabilities for both surface and underwater tasks, enabling the robot to quickly carry out underwater monitoring activities. Additionally, when it is necessary to reach another water body, SurfAAV can switch to aerial mode through a gliding takeoff, flying to the target water area to perform corresponding tasks. The main contribution of this letter lies in proposing a new solution for underwater, surface, and aerial movement, designing a novel hybrid prototype concept, developing the required control laws, and validating the robot's ability to successfully perform surface gliding and gliding takeoff. SurfAAV achieves a maximum surface gliding speed of 7.96 m/s and a maximum underwater speed of 3.1 m/s. The prototype's surface gliding maneuverability and underwater cruising maneuverability both exceed those of existing aquatic-aerial vehicles.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6c34\u4e0a-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4ebaSurfAAV\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6c34\u4e0b\u3001\u6c34\u9762\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6d6e\u529b\u8c03\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u4e0a-\u7a7a\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u6c34\u4e0b\u3001\u6c34\u9762\u548c\u7a7a\u4e2d\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u5dee\u52a8\u63a8\u529b\u77e2\u91cf\u6c34\u7ffc\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6c34\u9762\u6ed1\u884c\u548c\u6c34\u4e0b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "SurfAAV\u6c34\u9762\u6ed1\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe7.96 m/s\uff0c\u6c34\u4e0b\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe3.1 m/s\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfAAV\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this issue, we propose SynPo, a training-free few-shot method based on LVMs (e.g., SAM), with the core insight: improving the quality of negative prompts. To select point prompts in a more reliable confidence map, we design a novel Confidence Map Synergy Module by combining the strengths of DINOv2 and SAM. Based on the confidence map, we select the top-k pixels as the positive points set and choose the negative points set using a Gaussian distribution, followed by independent K-means clustering for both sets.

We introduce DeVisE (Demographics and Vital signs Evaluation), a behavioral testing framework for probing fine-grained clinical understanding. We construct a dataset of ICU discharge notes from MIMIC-IV, generating both raw (real-world) and template-based (synthetic) versions with controlled single-variable counterfactuals targeting demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and vital sign attributes. We evaluate five LLMs spanning general-purpose and medically fine-tuned variants, under both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We assess model behavior via (1) input-level sensitivity - how counterfactuals alter the likelihood of a note; and (2) downstream reasoning - how they affect predicted hospital length-of-stay. Our results show that zero-shot models exhibit more coherent counterfactual reasoning patterns, while fine-tuned models tend to be more stable yet less responsive to clinically meaningful changes.

The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance.

In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports. There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary, clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results.

By combining an online Positional Dilution of Precision (PDOP) estimation, a lightweight outlier detection method, and an adaptive robust kernel for non-linear optimization, our approach significantly improves robustness and suitability for real-world applications compared to state-of-the-art.

While numerous works aggregate neighbor using three-dimensional relative coordinates, there are irrelevant point interference and feature hierarchy gap problems due to the limitation of local coordinates. Although some works address this limitation by refining spatial description though explicit modeling of cross-stage structure, these enhancement methods based on direct geometric structure encoding have problems of high computational overhead and noise sensitivity. To overcome these problems, we propose the Point Distribution Set Abstraction module (PDSA) that utilizes the correlation in the high-dimensional space to correct the feature distribution during aggregation, which improves the computational efficiency and robustness. PDSA distinguishes the point correlation based on a lightweight cross-stage structural descriptor, and enhances structural homogeneity by reducing the variance of the neighbor feature matrix and increasing classes separability though long-distance modeling. Additionally, we introducing a key point mechanism to optimize the computational overhead.

Directly applying spatial interpolation methods to derive meteorological values at specific locations from low-resolution grid fields often yields results that deviate significantly from the actual conditions. Existing downscaling methods primarily rely on the coupling relationship between geostationary satellites and ERA5 variables as a condition. However, using brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites alone fails to comprehensively capture all the changes in meteorological variables in ERA5 maps. To address this limitation, we can use a wider range of satellite data to make more full use of its inversion effects on various meteorological variables, thus producing more realistic results across different meteorological variables. To further improve the accuracy of downscaling meteorological variables at any location, we propose the Multi-source Observation Down-Scaling Model (MODS). It is a conditional diffusion model that fuses data from multiple geostationary satellites GridSat, polar-orbiting satellites (AMSU-A, HIRS, and MHS), and topographic data (GEBCO), as conditions, and is pre-trained on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. During training, latent features from diverse conditional inputs are extracted separately and fused into ERA5 maps via a multi-source cross-attention module. By exploiting the inversion relationships between reanalysis data and multi-source atmospheric variables, MODS generates atmospheric states that align more closely with real-world conditions. During sampling, MODS enhances downscaling consistency by incorporating low-resolution ERA5 maps and station-level meteorological data as guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that MODS achieves higher fidelity when downscaling ERA5 maps to a 6.25 km resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6e90\u89c2\u6d4b\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff08MODS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u536b\u661f\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u504f\u79bb\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "MODS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u536b\u661f\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5230ERA5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMODS\u5728\u5c06ERA5\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81f36.25\u516c\u91cc\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MODS\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6c14\u8c61\u53d8\u91cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

The definitive article is available at https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-025-07055-5", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have revolutionized image processing, demonstrating significant potential in medical applications. Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for diagnostic procedures and necessary treatments. However, ultrasound images are notoriously noisy with low contrast and ambiguous LV boundaries, thereby complicating the segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Echo-DND, a novel dual-noise diffusion model specifically designed for this task. Echo-DND leverages a unique combination of Gaussian and Bernoulli noises. It also incorporates a multi-scale fusion conditioning module to improve segmentation precision. Furthermore, it utilizes spatial coherence calibration to maintain spatial integrity in segmentation masks. The model's performance was rigorously validated on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing SOTA models. It achieves high Dice scores of 0.962 and 0.939 on these datasets, respectively. The proposed Echo-DND model establishes a new standard in echocardiogram segmentation, and its architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy across various medical domains.

This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback.

However, integrating online learning into VFL presents challenges due to the unique nature of VFL, where clients possess non-intersecting feature sets for the same sample. In real-world scenarios, the clients may not receive data streaming for the disjoint features for the same entity synchronously. Instead, the data are typically generated by an \\emph{event} relevant to only a subset of clients. We are the first to identify these challenges in online VFL, which have been overlooked by previous research. To address these challenges, we proposed an event-driven online VFL framework. In this framework, only a subset of clients were activated during each event, while the remaining clients passively collaborated in the learning process. Furthermore, we incorporated \\emph{dynamic local regret (DLR)} into VFL to address the challenges posed by online learning problems with non-convex models within a non-stationary environment. We conducted a comprehensive regret analysis of our proposed framework, specifically examining the DLR under non-convex conditions with event-driven online VFL.

Our work addresses these questions through a user study, while proposing a new AI-based character representation and visualization tool. Our tool based on the Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) foundation model to analyze visual screen data to quantify character representation across dimensions of age and gender.

Next, we conducted a user study to seek empirical evidence on the usefulness and trustworthiness of the AI-generated results for carefully chosen movies presented in the form of our visualizations. We note that participants were able to understand the analytics from our visualization, and deemed the tool `overall useful'. Participants also indicated a need for more detailed visualizations to include more demographic categories and contextual information of the characters.

Existing techniques address only one side of this challenge. Visual grounding yields tight boxes and masks but rests on the unrealistic assumption that the object is present in every test image, producing a flood of false alarms when applied to web-scale collections. Text-to-image retrieval excels at sifting through massive databases to rank relevant images, yet it stops at whole-image matches and offers no fine-grained localization. We introduce Referring Search and Discovery (ReSeDis), the first task that unifies corpus-level retrieval with pixel-level grounding. Given a free-form description, a ReSeDis model must decide whether the queried object appears in each image and, if so, where it is, returning bounding boxes or segmentation masks. To enable rigorous study, we curate a benchmark in which every description maps uniquely to object instances scattered across a large, diverse corpus, eliminating unintended matches.

A key challenge is achieving robust cross-lingual lexical alignment, crucial for tasks like translation and cross-lingual information retrieval. This paper introduces Targeted Lexical Injection (TLI), a novel and efficient fine-tuning approach. We first demonstrate that Lugha-Llama-8B-wura, a Swahili-centric LLM, exhibits strong, near-perfect lexical alignment for Swahili-English word pairs in its early internal layers (specifically Layer 2, with ~0.99998 average cosine similarity based on a pilot study), a capability not fully reflected in its final output representations (baseline ~0.32 similarity on our evaluation set). TLI leverages this insight by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and a contrastive learning objective to fine-tune the model, specifically targeting embeddings from this empirically identified optimal early layer. Our experiments show that TLI significantly improves the output-level lexical alignment for 623 trained Swahili-English word pairs, increasing average cosine similarity from 0.3211 to 0.4113 (+28.08%, p < 1.33 x 10^-240). More importantly, these improvements generalize remarkably well to 63 unseen control word pairs, with similarity increasing from 0.3143 to 0.4033 (+28.32%, p < 7.17 x 10^-27). These findings suggest TLI enhances the model's ability to preserve and propagate its inherent early-layer cross-lingual knowledge, offering a parameter-efficient and effective strategy for improving lexical alignment in LRL-focused LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTLI\uff08Targeted Lexical Injection\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5185\u90e8\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\uff08Low-Rank Adaptation\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\uff08\u5982Layer 2\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "TLI\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65af\u74e6\u5e0c\u91cc\u8bed-\u82f1\u8bed\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4ece0.3211\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.4113\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u4e5f\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TLI\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we conducted a theoretical analysis of query efficiency within the context of federated black-box prompt tuning.

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views.

In this context, this paper seeks to protect users' privacy by implementing defenses at the image compression stage to prevent exploitation. Specifically, we propose a flexible coding method, termed Privacy-Shielded Image Compression (PSIC), that can produce bitstreams with multiple decoding options. By default, the bitstream is decoded to preserve satisfactory perceptual quality while preventing interpretation by VLP models. Our method also retains the original image compression functionality. With a customizable input condition, the proposed scheme can reconstruct the image that preserves its full semantic information. A Conditional Latent Trigger Generation (CLTG) module is proposed to produce bias information based on customizable conditions to guide the decoding process into different reconstructed versions, and an Uncertainty-Aware Encryption-Oriented (UAEO) optimization function is designed to leverage the soft labels inferred from the target VLP model's uncertainty on the training data. This paper further incorporates an adaptive multi-objective optimization strategy to obtain improved encrypting performance and perceptual quality simultaneously within a unified training process.

However, current frameworks face critical challenges in system architecture design, cross-domain generalizability, and performance guarantees, particularly as task complexity and number of agents increases. We introduces AgentGroupChat-V2, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a divide-and-conquer fully parallel architecture that decomposes user queries into hierarchical task forest structures enabling dependency management and distributed concurrent processing. (2) an adaptive collaboration engine that dynamically selects heterogeneous LLM combinations and interaction modes based on task characteristics. (3) agent organization optimization strategies combining divide-and-conquer approaches for efficient problem decomposition. Extensive experiments demonstrate AgentGroupChat-V2's superior performance across diverse domains, achieving 91.50% accuracy on GSM8K (exceeding the best baseline by 5.6 percentage points), 30.4% accuracy on competition-level AIME (nearly doubling other methods), and 79.20% pass@1 on HumanEval. Performance advantages become increasingly pronounced with higher task difficulty, particularly on Level 5 MATH problems where improvements exceed 11 percentage points compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These results confirm that AgentGroupChat-V2 provides a comprehensive solution for building efficient, general-purpose LLM multi-agent systems with significant advantages in complex reasoning scenarios.

We identify and characterize a special structure in the loss landscape: channels along which the loss decreases extremely slowly, while the output weights of at least two neurons, $a_i$ and $a_j$, diverge to $\\pm$infinity, and their input weight vectors, $\\mathbf{w_i}$ and $\\mathbf{w_j}$, become equal to each other. At convergence, the two neurons implement a gated linear unit: $a_i\u03c3(\\mathbf{w_i} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) + a_j\u03c3(\\mathbf{w_j} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) \\rightarrow \u03c3(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) \u03c3'(\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$. Geometrically, these channels to infinity are asymptotically parallel to symmetry-induced lines of critical points. Gradient flow solvers, and related optimization methods like SGD or ADAM, reach the channels with high probability in diverse regression settings, but without careful inspection they look like flat local minima with finite parameter values. Our characterization provides a comprehensive picture of these quasi-flat regions in terms of gradient dynamics, geometry, and functional interpretation.

Achieving high-quality fusion results requires a careful balance of brightness, color, contrast, and detail; this ensures that the fused images effectively display relevant anatomical structures and reflect the functional status of the tissues. However, existing MMIF methods have limited capacity to capture detailed features during conventional training and suffer from insufficient cross-modal feature interaction, leading to suboptimal fused image quality. To address these issues, this study proposes a two-stage diffusion model-based fusion network (DM-FNet) to achieve unified MMIF. In Stage I, a diffusion process trains UNet for image reconstruction. UNet captures detailed information through progressive denoising and represents multilevel data, providing a rich set of feature representations for the subsequent fusion network. In Stage II, noisy images at various steps are input into the fusion network to enhance the model's feature recognition capability. Three key fusion modules are also integrated to process medical images from different modalities adaptively. Ultimately, the robust network structure and a hybrid loss function are integrated to harmonize the fused image's brightness, color, contrast, and detail, enhancing its quality and information density. The experimental results across various medical image types demonstrate that the proposed method performs exceptionally well regarding objective evaluation metrics. The fused image preserves appropriate brightness, a comprehensive distribution of radioactive tracers, rich textures, and clear edges.

By altering problems in an intermediate symbolic representation, RE-IMAGINE generates arbitrarily many problems that are not solvable using memorization alone. Moreover, the framework is general and can work across reasoning domains, including math, code, and logic. We demonstrate our framework on four widely-used benchmarks to evaluate several families of LLMs, and observe reductions in performance when the models are queried with problem variations.

Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code, Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by 7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains.

In such cases, we expect the model to generate responses by grounding its response in the provided external context. However, prior work has shown that simply appending context at inference time does not ensure grounded generation. To address this, we propose Context-INformed Grounding Supervision (CINGS), a post-training supervision in which the model is trained with relevant context prepended to the response, while computing the loss only over the response tokens and masking out the context. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained with CINGS exhibit stronger grounding in both textual and visual domains compared to standard instruction-tuned models. In the text domain, CINGS outperforms other training methods across 11 information-seeking datasets and is complementary to inference-time grounding techniques. In the vision-language domain, replacing a vision-language model's LLM backbone with a CINGS-trained model reduces hallucinations across four benchmarks and maintains factual consistency throughout the generated response. This improved grounding comes without degradation in general downstream performance. Finally, we analyze the mechanism underlying the enhanced grounding in CINGS and find that it induces a shift in the model's prior knowledge and behavior, implicitly encouraging greater reliance on the external context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCINGS\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7f6e\u5230\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u5e76\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u54cd\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b80\u5355\u9644\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCINGS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u7f6e\u5230\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u54cd\u5e94\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c4f\u853d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCINGS\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CINGS\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u9690\u5f0f\u9f13\u52b1\u5176\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior work uses disagreement discrepancy (DIS^2) to derive practical error bounds under distribution shifts.

Although this approach offers a reliable and competitively accurate estimate of the target error, we identify a problem in this approach which causes the disagreement discrepancy objective to compete in the overlapping region between source and target domains. With an intuitive assumption that the target disagreement should be no more than the source disagreement in the overlapping region due to high enough support, we devise Overlap-aware Disagreement Discrepancy (ODD). Maximizing ODD only requires disagreement in the non-overlapping target domain, removing the competition. Our ODD-based bound uses domain-classifiers to estimate domain-overlap and better predicts target performance than DIS^2.

Our goal is to understand to what extent hallucinations occur, what types of inconsistencies trigger them, and how current models respond. To achieve these goals, we construct a hallucination probing set by building on an existing benchmark, capable of inducing hallucination rates up to 40x higher than base prompts.

However, efficient, high-quality automated process annotation remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce Single-Pass Annotation with Reference-Guided Evaluation (SPARE), a novel structured framework that enables single-pass, per-step annotation by aligning each solution step to one or multiple steps in a reference solution, accompanied by explicit reasoning for evaluation. We show that reference-guided step-level evaluation effectively facilitates process supervision on four datasets spanning three domains: mathematical reasoning, multi-hop compositional question answering, and spatial reasoning. We demonstrate that SPARE, when compared to baselines, improves reasoning performance when used for: (1) fine-tuning models in an offline RL setup for inference-time greedy-decoding, and (2) training reward models for ranking/aggregating multiple LLM-generated outputs. Additionally, SPARE achieves competitive performance on challenging mathematical datasets while offering 2.6 times greater efficiency, requiring only 38% of the runtime, compared to tree search-based automatic annotation.

Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error.

In this paper, we propose a novel method, RA-NeRF, capable of predicting highly accurate camera poses even with complex camera trajectories. Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories.

However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets.

Existing methods predominantly follow the parametric feedforward architecture based on static visual representation modeling. However, they lack explicit mechanisms for acquiring historical context, limiting their adaptation and effectiveness in handling challenging camouflage scenes. In this paper, we propose a recall-augmented COD architecture, namely RetroMem, which dynamically modulates camouflage pattern perception and inference by integrating relevant historical knowledge into the process. Specifically, RetroMem employs a two-stage training paradigm consisting of a learning stage and a recall stage to construct, update, and utilize memory representations effectively. During the learning stage, we design a dense multi-scale adapter (DMA) to improve the pretrained encoder's capability to capture rich multi-scale visual information with very few trainable parameters, thereby providing foundational inferences. In the recall stage, we propose a dynamic memory mechanism (DMM) and an inference pattern reconstruction (IPR). These components fully leverage the latent relationships between learned knowledge and current sample context to reconstruct the inference of camouflage patterns, thereby significantly improving the model's understanding of camouflage scenes.

Through comprehensive experiments across ASQA, QAMPARI, ELI5, and ExpertQA we show that reasoning-augmented models significantly outperform instruction-only variants, especially in handling unanswerable queries and generating well-cited responses. A two-stage training setup, first optimizing answer and citation behavior and then refusal, further improves grounding by stabilizing the learning signal.

While previous works have explored representation learning for this task, the critical challenge of training instability in sequential representations and its detrimental impact on policy performance has been overlooked. This work demonstrates that Controlled Differential Equations (CDE) state representation can achieve strong RL policies when two key factors are met: (1) ensuring training stability through early stopping or stabilization methods, and (2) enforcing acuity-aware representations by correlation regularization with clinical scores (SOFA, SAPS-II, OASIS). Experiments on the MIMIC-III sepsis cohort reveal that stable CDE autoencoder produces representations strongly correlated with acuity scores and enables RL policies with superior performance (WIS return $> 0.9$). In contrast, unstable CDE representation leads to degraded representations and policy failure (WIS return $\\sim$ 0). Visualizations of the latent space show that stable CDEs not only separate survivor and non-survivor trajectories but also reveal clear acuity score gradients, whereas unstable training fails to capture either pattern.

Minimizing these vibrations is crucial for improving passenger comfort. This work presents a novel design optimization approach based on guided flow matching for reducing vibrations by placing beadings (indentations) in plate-like structures. Our method integrates a generative flow matching model and a surrogate model trained to predict structural vibrations. During the generation process, the flow matching model pushes towards manufacturability while the surrogate model pushes to low-vibration solutions. The flow matching model and its training data implicitly define the design space, enabling a broader exploration of potential solutions as no optimization of manually-defined design parameters is required. We apply our method to a range of differentiable optimization objectives, including direct optimization of specific eigenfrequencies through careful construction of the objective function. Results demonstrate that our method generates diverse and manufacturable plate designs with reduced structural vibrations compared to designs from random search, a criterion-based design heuristic and genetic optimization.

However, the crucial choice of window size presents a Pareto tradeoff: larger windows maintain performance akin to full attention but offer minimal efficiency gains in short-context scenarios, while smaller windows can lead to performance degradation. Current models, such as Gemma2 and Mistral, adopt conservative window sizes (e.g., 4096 out of an 8192 pretraining length) to preserve performance. This work investigates strategies to shift this Pareto frontier, enabling local-global models to achieve efficiency gains even in short-context regimes. Our core motivation is to address the intrinsic limitation of local attention -- its complete disregard for tokens outside the defined window. We explore RATTENTION, a variant of local attention integrated with a specialized linear attention mechanism designed to capture information from these out-of-window tokens. Pretraining experiments at the 3B and 12B scales demonstrate that RATTENTION achieves a superior Pareto tradeoff between performance and efficiency. As a sweet spot, RATTENTION with a window size of just 512 consistently matches the performance of full-attention models across diverse settings. Furthermore, the recurrent nature inherent in the linear attention component of RATTENTION contributes to enhanced long-context performance, as validated on the RULER benchmark. Crucially, these improvements do not compromise training efficiency; thanks to a specialized kernel implementation and the reduced window size, RATTENTION maintains training speeds comparable to existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "RATTENTION\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ffd\u7565\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRATTENTION\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7a97\u53e3\u5916\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u57283B\u548c12B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cRATTENTION\u4ee5512\u7a97\u53e3\u5927\u5c0f\u5339\u914d\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "RATTENTION\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This overlooks the fact that only a subset of tokens often contains critical, task-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce Supervised Fine-Tuning with Group Optimization (SFT-GO), a novel approach that treats groups of tokens differently based on their importance.SFT-GO groups tokens in each sample based on their importance values and optimizes the LLM using a weighted combination of the worst-group loss and the standard cross-entropy loss. This mechanism adaptively emphasizes the most challenging token groups and guides the model to better handle different group distributions, thereby improving overall learning dynamics. We provide a theoretical analysis of SFT-GO's convergence rate, demonstrating its efficiency. Empirically, we apply SFT-GO with three different token grouping strategies and show that models trained with SFT-GO consistently outperform baseline approaches across popular LLM benchmarks.

This elicits the requirement of group identification (GI), which is to recommend groups to users. We reveal that users are influenced by both group-level and item-level interests, and these dual-level interests have a collaborative evolution relationship: joining a group expands the user's item interests, further prompting the user to join new groups. Ultimately, the two interests tend to align dynamically. However, existing GI methods fail to fully model this collaborative evolution relationship, ignoring the enhancement of group-level interests on item-level interests, and suffering from false-negative samples when aligning cross-level interests. In order to fully model the collaborative evolution relationship between dual-level user interests, we propose CI4GI, a Collaborative Interest-aware model for Group Identification. Specifically, we design an interest enhancement strategy that identifies additional interests of users from the items interacted with by the groups they have joined as a supplement to item-level interests. In addition, we adopt the distance between interest distributions of two users to optimize the identification of negative samples for a user, mitigating the interference of false-negative samples during cross-level interests alignment. The results of experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that CI4GI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCI4GI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u7ea7\u5174\u8da3\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\u6539\u8fdb\u7fa4\u7ec4\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7fa4\u7ec4\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u7fa4\u7ec4\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5174\u8da3\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u8865\u5145\u9879\u76ee\u7ea7\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCI4GI\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CI4GI\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u53cc\u7ea7\u5174\u8da3\u534f\u540c\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7fa4\u7ec4\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To make this process more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side, $\u03bcP$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for larger models without additional tuning. While $\u03bc$P showed impressive results in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\u03bc$P is the fact that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics \\emph{interpolate between the $\u03bc$P regime and another regime that we call Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those predicted by $\u03bc$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\u0398(\\sqrt{width})$, surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the literature, and different from the $\u0398(width)$ ratio predicted by $\u03bc$P.

Augmented reality (AR) systems, integrating MRI/CT with laparoscopic images based on 2D-3D registration, offer a promising solution for enhancing surgical navigation. A vital aspect of the registration progress is the precise detection of curvilinear anatomical landmarks in laparoscopic images. In this paper, we propose BCRNet (Bezier Curve Refinement Net), a novel framework that significantly enhances landmark detection in laparoscopic liver surgery primarily via the Bezier curve refinement strategy. The framework starts with a Multi-modal Feature Extraction (MFE) module designed to robustly capture semantic features. Then we propose Adaptive Curve Proposal Initialization (ACPI) to generate pixel-aligned Bezier curves and confidence scores for reliable initial proposals.

For example, identifying and engaging motivated collaborators who are willing to co-design and deploy AI based solutions in real-world settings is often difficult. Even when such partnerships are established, many AI4SI projects \"fail\" to progress beyond the proof-of-concept stage, and hence, are unable to transition to at-scale production-level solutions. Furthermore, the unique challenges faced by AI4SI researchers are not always fully recognized within the broader AI community, where such work is sometimes viewed as primarily applied and not aligning with the traditional criteria for novelty emphasized in core AI venues. This paper attempts to shine a light on the diverse challenges faced in AI4SI research by diagnosing a multitude of factors that prevent AI4SI partnerships from achieving real-world impact on the ground. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with six leading AI4SI researchers - complemented by the authors' own lived experiences in conducting AI4SI research - this paper attempts to understand the day-to-day difficulties faced in developing and deploying socially impactful AI solutions. Through thematic analysis, we identify structural and organizational, communication, collaboration, and operational challenges as key barriers to deployment. While there are no easy fixes, we synthesize best practices and actionable strategies drawn from these interviews and our own work in this space.

However, this paradigm is both costly and data-intensive. To address this, we propose RaCalNet, a novel framework that eliminates the need for dense supervision by using sparse LiDAR to supervise the learning of refined radar measurements, resulting in a supervision density of merely around 1% compared to dense-supervised methods. Unlike previous approaches that associate radar points with broad image regions and rely heavily on dense labels, RaCalNet first recalibrates and refines sparse radar points to construct accurate depth priors. These priors then serve as reliable anchors to guide monocular depth prediction, enabling metric-scale estimation without resorting to dense supervision. This design improves structural consistency and preserves fine details. Despite relying solely on sparse supervision, RaCalNet surpasses state-of-the-art dense-supervised methods, producing depth maps with clear object contours and fine-grained textures.

Our study highlights the importance of improving LLMs' inclusivity, providing a critical benchmark for future advancements in gender fairness in generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u516c\u5e73\u6307\u6570\uff08GIFI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8c\u5143\u548c\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b64\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u4e8c\u5143\u6027\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8LLMs\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGIFI\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u8bcd\u63a2\u6d4b\u3001\u751f\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf922\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cLLMs\u5728\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6027\u522b\u6807\u8bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u6027\u522b\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u522b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Recently, the Muon optimizer [JJB+24] has demonstrated promising empirical performance, but its theoretical foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we bridge this gap and provide a theoretical analysis of Muon by placing it within the Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ family of optimizers [CLLL24]. Specifically, we show that Muon corresponds to Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ when equipped with the nuclear norm, and we leverage the theoretical results of Lion-$\\mathcal{K}$ to establish that Muon (with decoupled weight decay) implicitly solves an optimization problem that enforces a constraint on the spectral norm of weight matrices. This perspective not only demystifies the implicit regularization effects of Muon but also leads to natural generalizations through varying the choice of convex map $\\mathcal{K}$, allowing for the exploration of a broader class of implicitly regularized and constrained optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

However, deploying these models for reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation of memory and reasoning.

Current approaches typically merge sentence-level parsing outputs for discourse input, often missing phenomena like cross-sentence coreference, resulting in fragmented graphs and degraded downstream VLM task performance. To address this, we introduce a new task, Discourse-level text Scene Graph parsing (DiscoSG), supported by our dataset DiscoSG-DS, which comprises 400 expert-annotated and 8,430 synthesised multi-sentence caption-graph pairs for images. Each caption averages 9 sentences, and each graph contains at least 3 times more triples than those in existing datasets. While fine-tuning large PLMs (i.e., GPT-4) on DiscoSG-DS improves SPICE by approximately 48% over the best sentence-merging baseline, high inference cost and restrictive licensing hinder its open-source use, and smaller fine-tuned PLMs struggle with complex graphs. We propose DiscoSG-Refiner, which drafts a base graph using one small PLM, then employs a second PLM to iteratively propose graph edits, reducing full-graph generation overhead. Using two Flan-T5-Base models, DiscoSG-Refiner still improves SPICE by approximately 30% over the best baseline while achieving 86 times faster inference than GPT-4. It also consistently improves downstream VLM tasks like discourse-level caption evaluation and hallucination detection.

Training high-performance models for this task typically requires large-scale annotated datasets, which are both expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Active Learning (AL) offers a solution by iteratively selecting the most informative samples for annotation, thereby reducing the labeling effort. However, most AL methods are designed under the assumption of a closed-set scenario, where all the unannotated images belong to target classes. In real-world clinical environments, the unlabeled pool often contains a substantial amount of Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data, leading to low efficiency of annotation in traditional AL methods. Furthermore, most existing AL methods start with random selection in the first query round, leading to a significant waste of labeling costs in open-set scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose OpenPath, a novel open-set active learning approach for pathological image classification leveraging a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM). In the first query, we propose task-specific prompts that combine target and relevant non-target class prompts to effectively select In-Distribution (ID) and informative samples from the unlabeled pool. In subsequent queries, Diverse Informative ID Sampling (DIS) that includes Prototype-based ID candidate Selection (PIS) and Entropy-Guided Stochastic Sampling (EGSS) is proposed to ensure both purity and informativeness in a query, avoiding the selection of OOD samples. Experiments on two public pathology image datasets show that OpenPath significantly enhances the model's performance due to its high purity of selected samples, and outperforms several state-of-the-art open-set AL methods.

However, pervasive missing data caused by sensor failures and heterogeneous sensing gaps fundamentally hinders reliable traffic modeling. This paper proposes a Neural Canonical Polyadic Factorization (NCPF) model that synergizes low-rank tensor algebra with deep representation learning for robust traffic data imputation. The model innovatively embeds CP decomposition into neural architecture through learnable embedding projections, where sparse traffic tensors are encoded into dense latent factors across road segments, time intervals, and mobility metrics.

Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over 3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms, including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU. ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices.

Recent advances in generative AI provide an opportunity to automate MCQ generation efficiently.

This aspect becomes particularly important when the generated MCQs are meant to be applied in real-world settings. Additionally, most MCQ generation studies focus on English, leaving other languages underexplored. This paper investigates the capabilities of current generative models in producing MCQs for reading comprehension in Portuguese, a morphologically rich language. Our study focuses on generating MCQs that align with curriculum-relevant narrative elements and span different difficulty levels. We evaluate these MCQs through expert review and by analyzing the psychometric properties extracted from student responses to assess their suitability for elementary school students. Our results show that current models can generate MCQs of comparable quality to human-authored ones. However, we identify issues related to semantic clarity and answerability.

However, a fundamental challenge in this field lies in effectively verifying whether unlearning operations have been successfully and thoroughly executed. Despite a growing body of work on unlearning techniques, verification methodologies remain comparatively underexplored and often fragmented. Existing approaches lack a unified taxonomy and a systematic framework for evaluation. To bridge this gap, this paper presents the first structured survey of machine unlearning verification methods.

Our method uses surface normal estimation to guide the unwrapping process while preserving the geometric consistency between the 3D surface and the 2D texture space. We focus on two challenging species: Saimaa ringed seals (Pusa hispida saimensis) and leopards (Panthera pardus). Both species have distinctive yet highly deformable fur patterns. By integrating our pattern-preserving UV mapping with existing re-identification techniques, we demonstrate improved accuracy across diverse poses and viewing angles.

Studying the regret mechanism is crucial for enhancing model reliability and helps in revealing how cognition is coded in neural networks.

This analysis requires examining the model's hidden states, where information processing occurs at the neuron level. However, this faces three key challenges: (1) the absence of specialized datasets capturing regret expressions, (2) the lack of metrics to find the optimal regret representation layer, and (3) the lack of metrics for identifying and analyzing regret neurons. Addressing these limitations, we propose: (1) a workflow for constructing a comprehensive regret dataset through strategically designed prompting scenarios, (2) the Supervised Compression-Decoupling Index (S-CDI) metric to identify optimal regret representation layers, and (3) the Regret Dominance Score (RDS) metric to identify regret neurons and the Group Impact Coefficient (GIC) to analyze activation patterns. Our experimental results successfully identified the optimal regret representation layer using the S-CDI metric, which significantly enhanced performance in probe classification experiments.

However, the incorporation of these techniques often results in a significant degradation in model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a decentralized DML framework, named ImprovDML, that achieves high model accuracy while simultaneously ensuring privacy preservation and resilience to Byzantine attacks. The framework leverages a kind of resilient vector consensus algorithms that can compute a point within the normal (non-Byzantine) agents' convex hull for resilient aggregation at each iteration. Then, multivariate Gaussian noises are introduced to the gradients for privacy preservation. We provide convergence guarantees and derive asymptotic learning error bounds under non-convex settings, which are tighter than those reported in existing works. For the privacy analysis, we adopt the notion of concentrated geo-privacy, which quantifies privacy preservation based on the Euclidean distance between inputs.

Data-Free Image Synthesis (DFIS) aims to generate images that approximate the learned data distribution of a pre-trained model without accessing the original data. However, existing DFIS meth ods produce samples that deviate from the training data distribution due to the lack of prior knowl edge about natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose DDIS, the first Diffusion-assisted Data-free Image Synthesis method that leverages a text-to-image diffusion model as a powerful image prior, improving synthetic image quality. DDIS extracts knowledge about the learned distribution from the given model and uses it to guide the diffusion model, enabling the generation of images that accurately align with the training data distribution. To achieve this, we introduce Domain Alignment Guidance (DAG) that aligns the synthetic data domain with the training data domain during the diffusion sampling process. Furthermore, we optimize a single Class Alignment Token (CAT) embedding to effectively capture class-specific attributes in the training dataset.

Our model comparisons suggested that cross-cultural differences in intensifier interpretation stem from a combination of (1) different literal meanings, (2) different weights on utterance cost. These findings challenge accounts based purely on semantic variation or politeness norms, demonstrating that cross-cultural differences in interpretation emerge from an intricate interplay between the two.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u82f1\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7f8e\u5f0f\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u201cquite\u201d\u548c\u201cvery\u201d\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u8bef\u89e3\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u8fd8\u662f\u8bed\u7528\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u793c\u8c8c\u548c\u7b80\u6d01\u89c4\u8303\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u82f1\u5f0f\u548c\u7f8e\u5f0f\u82f1\u8bed\u4f7f\u7528\u8005\u5bf9\u5f3a\u8c03\u8bcd\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u7531\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u548c\u8bdd\u8bed\u6210\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u793c\u8c8c\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u5dee\u5f02\u662f\u5b57\u9762\u610f\u4e49\u4e0e\u8bed\u7528\u56e0\u7d20\u590d\u6742\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

The capacity to separate out-of-distribution (OOD) samples has proven to be a valuable indicator of a model's reliability in research. In medical imaging, this is especially critical, as identifying OOD inputs can help flag potential anomalies that might otherwise go undetected. While many OOD detection methods rely on feature or logit space representations, recent works suggest these approaches may not fully capture OOD diversity. To address this, we propose a novel OOD scoring mechanism, called NERO, that leverages neuron-level relevance at the feature layer. Specifically, we cluster neuron-level relevance for each in-distribution (ID) class to form representative centroids and introduce a relevance distance metric to quantify a new sample's deviation from these centroids, enhancing OOD separability. Additionally, we refine performance by incorporating scaled relevance in the bias term and combining feature norms. Our framework also enables explainable OOD detection.

Beyond the quantity and discretization of data, we identify that the function space of the data is critical to the generalization of the model. We prove generalization bounds and convergence rates under finite data discretizations and restricted training data subspaces by analyzing the training dynamics and deriving optimal parameters for both a white-box differential equation discovery method and a black-box linear model. The analytically derived generalization bounds are replicated empirically. Similar lack of generalization is empirically demonstrated for deep linear models, shallow neural networks, and physics-specific DeepONets and Neural Operators. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that generalization to the true physical equation is not guaranteed in each explored case. Surprisingly, we find that different classes of models can exhibit opposing generalization behaviors. Based on our theoretical analysis, we also demonstrate a new mechanistic interpretability lens on scientific models whereby Green's function representations can be extracted from the weights of black-box models.

We find that the resource demands of LLM applications can be modeled in a general and accurate manner with Probabilistic Demand Graph (PDGraph). We then propose Hermes, which leverages PDGraph for efficient serving of LLM applications.

While large language models (LLMs) show great promise in addressing this challenge, their effective integration with medical imaging data still deserves in-depth exploration. In this paper, we present MRG-LLM, a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) that combines a frozen LLM with a learnable visual encoder and introduces a dynamic prompt customization mechanism. Our key innovation lies in generating instance-specific prompts tailored to individual medical images through conditional affine transformations derived from visual features.

We show that the various validity conditions alone do not guarantee a good approximation of the average. Furthermore, we show that reaching good approximation does not give good results in experimental settings due to possible Byzantine outliers. Our main contribution is the first lower bound of $\\min\\{\\frac{n-t}{t},\\sqrt{d}\\}$ on the centroid approximation under box validity that is often considered in the literature, where $n$ is the number of clients, $t$ the upper bound on the number of Byzantine faults, and $d$ is the dimension of the machine learning model. We complement this lower bound by an upper bound of $2\\min\\{n,\\sqrt{d}\\}$, by providing a new analysis for the case $n<d$. In addition, we present a new algorithm that achieves a $\\sqrt{2d}$-approximation under convex validity, which also proves that the existing lower bound in the literature is tight.

In the initial stage of our framework, we employ an Object-AnchorNet to reconstruct sparse 3D HOI keyframes for unseen objects, learning solely from 3D HOI datasets, thereby mitigating the dependence on large-scale 4D HOI datasets. Subsequently, we introduce a Contact-Aware Diffusion Model (ContactDM) in the second stage to seamlessly interpolate sparse 3D HOI keyframes into densely temporally coherent 4D HOI sequences. To enhance the quality of generated 4D HOI sequences, we propose a novel Contact-Aware Encoder within ContactDM to extract human-object contact patterns and a novel Contact-Aware HOI Attention to effectively integrate the contact signals into diffusion models.

We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking.

Dataset Inference (DI) offers a potential remedy by identifying whether a suspect dataset was used in training, thereby enabling data owners to verify unauthorized use. However, existing DI methods require a private set-known to be absent from training-that closely matches the compromised dataset's distribution. Such in-distribution, held-out data is rarely available in practice, severely limiting the applicability of DI. In this work, we address this challenge by synthetically generating the required held-out set. Our approach tackles two key obstacles: (1) creating high-quality, diverse synthetic data that accurately reflects the original distribution, which we achieve via a data generator trained on a carefully designed suffix-based completion task, and (2) bridging likelihood gaps between real and synthetic data, which is realized through post-hoc calibration.

Here we assess the sensitivity of 21 MT systems to the need for gender neutrality in response to gender ambiguity in three translation directions of varying difficulty. The specific gender-neutral strategies that are observed in practice are categorized and discussed. Additionally, we examine the effect of binary gender stereotypes on the use of gender-neutral translation.

Whereas most prior studies optimise charging locations for single cities, state-wide and national networks must reconcile the conflicting requirements of dense metropolitan cores, car-dependent exurbs, and power-constrained rural corridors.\n  We present DOVA-PATBM (Deployment Optimisation with Voronoi-oriented, Adaptive, POI-Aware Temporal Behaviour Model), a geo-computational framework that unifies these contexts in a single pipeline. The method rasterises heterogeneous data (roads, population, night lights, POIs, and feeder lines) onto a hierarchical H3 grid, infers intersection importance with a zone-normalised graph neural network centrality model, and overlays a Voronoi tessellation that guarantees at least one five-port DC fast charger within every 30 km radius. Hourly arrival profiles, learned from loop-detector and floating-car traces, feed a finite M/M/c queue to size ports under feeder-capacity and outage-risk constraints. A greedy maximal-coverage heuristic with income-weighted penalties then selects the minimum number of sites that satisfy coverage and equity targets.\n  Applied to the State of Georgia, USA, DOVA-PATBM (i) increases 30 km tile coverage by 12 percentage points, (ii) halves the mean distance that low-income residents travel to the nearest charger, and (iii) meets sub-transmission headroom everywhere -- all while remaining computationally tractable for national-scale roll-outs.

This has spurred interest in distilling knowledge from large VLMs into smaller, more efficient counterparts. A key challenge arises here from the diversity of VLM architectures, which are built on different LLMs and employ varying token types-differing in vocabulary size, token splits, and token index ordering. To address this challenge of limitation to a specific VLM type, we present Generation after Recalibration (GenRecal), a novel, general-purpose distillation framework for VLMs. GenRecal incorporates a Recalibrator that aligns and adapts feature representations between heterogeneous VLMs, enabling effective knowledge transfer across different types of VLMs. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks, we demonstrate that GenRecal significantly improves baseline performances, eventually outperforming large-scale open- and closed-source VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenRecal\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u901a\u7528\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578bVLMs\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684VLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGenRecal\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bRecalibrator\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784VLMs\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cGenRecal\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u7684\u5927\u578bVLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "GenRecal\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784VLMs\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the diversity of model implementations and training strategies across recent TFMs, though promising, makes it challenging to isolate the contribution of individual design choices or evaluate their potential synergies. This hinders the field's ability to converge on best practices and limits the reproducibility of insights across studies. We present BMFM-RNA, an open-source, modular software package that unifies diverse TFM pretraining and fine-tuning objectives within a single framework.

In this paper, we describe the framework, supported input representations, and training objectives. We evaluated four model checkpoints pretrained on CELLxGENE using combinations of masked language modeling (MLM), WCED and multitask learning. Using the benchmarking capabilities of BMFM-RNA, we show that WCED-based models achieve performance that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches like scGPT across more than a dozen datasets in both zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks.

Secure multi-party computation (MPC)-based privacy-preserving machine learning offers a powerful approach to protect both model parameters and user data, but its application to LLMs has been largely limited to inference, as fine-tuning introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in privacy-preserving backward propagation and optimizer operations. This paper identifies two primary obstacles to MPC-based privacy-preserving fine-tuning of LLMs: (1) the substantial computational overhead of backward and optimizer processes, and (2) the inefficiency of softmax-based attention mechanisms in MPC settings. To address these challenges, we propose SecFwT, the first MPC-based framework designed for efficient, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning. SecFwT introduces a forward-only tuning paradigm to eliminate backward and optimizer computations and employs MPC-friendly Random Feature Attention to approximate softmax attention, significantly reducing costly non-linear operations and computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that SecFwT delivers substantial improvements in efficiency and privacy preservation, enabling scalable and secure fine-tuning of LLMs for privacy-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSecFwT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MPC\u73af\u5883\u4e0bLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LLM\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u8981\u6c42\uff0cMPC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSecFwT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u524d\u5411\u8c03\u4f18\u548cMPC\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aSecFwT\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "SecFwT\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u7684LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing works have demonstrated that pre-trained Text-to-Image diffusion models can achieve this goal without training on any specific data; however, they often face challenges with imprecise localization and unrealistic artifacts. Focusing on these drawbacks, we propose a novel training-free method, WinWinLay. At its core, WinWinLay presents two key strategies, Non-local Attention Energy Function and Adaptive Update, that collaboratively enhance control precision and realism. On one hand, we theoretically demonstrate that the commonly used attention energy function introduces inherent spatial distribution biases, hindering objects from being uniformly aligned with layout instructions. To overcome this issue, non-local attention prior is explored to redistribute attention scores, facilitating objects to better conform to the specified spatial conditions. On the other hand, we identify that the vanilla backpropagation update rule can cause deviations from the pre-trained domain, leading to out-of-distribution artifacts. We accordingly introduce a Langevin dynamics-based adaptive update scheme as a remedy that promotes in-domain updating while respecting layout constraints.

To shed light on this capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of the form $\\sum_{i\\ge 0} a_i (X^\\top X)^iX^\\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning. Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their semi-supervision capabilities.

Predicting abnormal values of not prescribed tests based on the results of performed tests looks intriguing, as it would be possible to make early diagnosis available to everyone. The special place is taken by the Common Blood Count (CBC) test, as it is the most widely used clinical procedure. Combining routine biochemical panels with CBC presents a set of test-value pairs that varies from patient to patient, or, in common settings, a table with missing values. Here we formulate a tabular modeling problem as a set translation problem where the source set comprises pairs of GPT-like label column embedding and its corresponding value while the target set consists of the same type embeddings only. The proposed approach can effectively deal with missing values without implicitly estimating them and bridges the world of LLM with the tabular domain.

We built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge) and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).\n  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on 749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting) and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic factors.\n  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication. FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest (adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex, race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved prognostic accuracy.\n  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related mortality risk.

Quantitative Structural Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale, non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless, end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales.

Accurate and stable MD simulations, crucial for evaluating material properties, require training data encompassing both low-energy stable structures and high-energy structures. Conventional knowledge distillation (KD) methods fine-tune a pre-trained NNP as a teacher model to generate training data for a student model. However, in material-specific models, this fine-tuning process increases energy barriers, making it difficult to create training data containing high-energy structures. To address this, we propose a novel KD framework that leverages a non-fine-tuned, off-the-shelf pre-trained NNP as a teacher. Its gentler energy landscape facilitates the exploration of a wider range of structures, including the high-energy structures crucial for stable MD simulations. Our framework employs a two-stage training process: first, the student NNP is trained with a dataset generated by the off-the-shelf teacher; then, it is fine-tuned with a smaller, high-accuracy density functional theory (DFT) dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying it to both organic (polyethylene glycol) and inorganic (L$_{10}$GeP$_{2}$S$_{12}$) materials, achieving comparable or superior accuracy in reproducing physical properties compared to existing methods. Importantly, our method reduces the number of expensive DFT calculations by 10x compared to existing NNP generation methods, without sacrificing accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u52bf\u80fd\uff08NNP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6602\u8d35\u7684DFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u80fd\u91cf\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6559\u5e08NNP\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751fNNP\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6DFT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6709\u673a\u548c\u65e0\u673a\u6750\u6599\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06DFT\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing SD-based Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence, resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a single diffusion step.

This study introduces a topological framework for identifying structural change in media narratives using persistent homology. Drawing on international news articles surrounding major events - including the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022), the murder of George Floyd (May 2020), the U.S. Capitol insurrection (Jan 2021), and the Hamas-led invasion of Israel (Oct 2023) - we construct daily co-occurrence graphs of noun phrases to trace evolving discourse. Each graph is embedded and transformed into a persistence diagram via a Vietoris-Rips filtration. We then compute Wasserstein distances and persistence entropies across homological dimensions to capture semantic disruption and narrative volatility over time. Our results show that major geopolitical and social events align with sharp spikes in both H0 (connected components) and H1 (loops), indicating sudden reorganization in narrative structure and coherence. Cross-correlation analyses reveal a typical lag pattern in which changes to component-level structure (H0) precede higher-order motif shifts (H1), suggesting a bottom-up cascade of semantic change. An exception occurs during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where H1 entropy leads H0, possibly reflecting top-down narrative framing before local discourse adjusts. Persistence entropy further distinguishes tightly focused from diffuse narrative regimes. These findings demonstrate that persistent homology offers a mathematically principled, unsupervised method for detecting inflection points and directional shifts in public attention - without requiring prior knowledge of specific events.

The advantage of these methods is the ability to generate high-resolution samples, which are otherwise unattainable with classical inversion methods or other deep learning-based solutions. However, the iterative and stochastic nature of sampling from diffusion models along with heuristic nature of output control remain limiting factors for their applicability. For instance, an optimal way to include the approximate velocity model into diffusion-based inversion scheme remains unclear, even though it is considered an essential part of FWI pipeline. We address the issue by employing a Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge that interpolates between the distributions of ground truth and smoothed velocity models. To facilitate the learning of nonlinear drifts that transfer samples between distributions we extend the concept of Image-to-Image Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge ($\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) to conditional sampling, resulting in a conditional Image-to-Image Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (c$\\text{I}^2\\text{SB}$) framework. To validate our method, we assess its effectiveness in reconstructing the reference velocity model from its smoothed approximation, coupled with the observed seismic signal of fixed shape. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms our reimplementation of conditional diffusion model suggested in earlier works, while requiring only a few neural function evaluations (NFEs) to achieve sample fidelity superior to that attained with supervised learning-based approach.

However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images. We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only, without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods.

However, applying DiTs to molecules introduces novel challenges, such as integrating discrete molecular graph information with continuous 3D geometry, handling Euclidean symmetries, and designing conditioning mechanisms that generalize across molecules of varying sizes and structures. We propose DiTMC, a framework that adapts DiTs to address these challenges through a modular architecture that separates the processing of 3D coordinates from conditioning on atomic connectivity. To this end, we introduce two complementary graph-based conditioning strategies that integrate seamlessly with the DiT architecture. These are combined with different attention mechanisms, including both standard non-equivariant and SO(3)-equivariant formulations, enabling flexible control over the trade-off between between accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments on standard conformer generation benchmarks (GEOM-QM9, -DRUGS, -XL) demonstrate that DiTMC achieves state-of-the-art precision and physical validity.

HOI generation is extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality.

Its effectiveness is significantly influenced by the choice of the underlying ground metric. Traditionally, the ground metric has either been (i) predefined, e.g., as the Euclidean distance, or (ii) learned in a supervised way, by utilizing labeled data to learn a suitable ground metric for enhanced task-specific performance. Yet, predefined metrics typically cannot account for the inherent structure and varying importance of different features in the data, and existing supervised approaches to ground metric learning often do not generalize across multiple classes or are restricted to distributions with shared supports. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for learning metrics for arbitrary distributions over a shared metric space. Our method provides a distance between individual points like a global metric, but requires only class labels on a distribution-level for training. The learned global ground metric enables more accurate optimal transport distances, leading to improved performance in embedding, clustering and classification tasks.

In this work, we address the challenge of leveraging the representational power of generative models for exploration without relying on explicit uncertainty quantification. We introduce a novel framework that casts exploration as entropy maximization over the approximate data manifold implicitly defined by a pre-trained diffusion model. Then, we present a novel principle for exploration based on density estimation, a problem well-known to be challenging in practice. To overcome this issue and render this method truly scalable, we leverage a fundamental connection between the entropy of the density induced by a diffusion model and its score function. Building on this, we develop an algorithm based on mirror descent that solves the exploration problem as sequential fine-tuning of a pre-trained diffusion model. We prove its convergence to the optimal exploratory diffusion model under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows.

Does higher perceptual quality of images already translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity. Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning (VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable, low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content; and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets, VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached features, or extra training data.

Given a highly contagious disease, a natural question is how to best vaccinate individuals to minimize the disease's extinction time. While previous works showed that the problem of optimal vaccination is closely linked to the NP-hard Spectral Radius Minimization (SRM) problem, they assumed that the graph is known, which is often not the case in practice. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the extinction time of an outbreak modeled by an SIS model where the graph on which the disease spreads is unknown and only the infection states of the vertices are observed. To this end, we split the problem into two: learning the graph and determining effective vaccination strategies. We propose a novel inclusion-exclusion-based learning algorithm and, unlike previous approaches, establish its sample complexity for graph recovery. We then detail an optimal algorithm for the SRM problem and prove that its running time is polynomial in the number of vertices for graphs with bounded treewidth. This is complemented by an efficient and effective polynomial-time greedy heuristic for any graph.

We introduce \\textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and explanatory, while achieving over 4$\\times$ speedup compared to existing value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA Mistral-7B, \\textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger unseen model}.

Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and narratives.

While powerful, their complexity poses a major challenge to trustworthiness, particularly due to a lack of transparency. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by providing human-understandable explanations of model behavior. However, to ensure their usefulness and trustworthiness, such explanations must be rigorously evaluated. Despite the growing number of XAI methods, the field lacks standardized evaluation protocols and consensus on appropriate metrics. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and introduce a unified framework for the eValuation of XAI (VXAI). We identify 362 relevant publications and aggregate their contributions into 41 functionally similar metric groups. In addition, we propose a three-dimensional categorization scheme spanning explanation type, evaluation contextuality, and explanation quality desiderata.

Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative capabilities of video diffusion models.

To guide policy optimization, reward models are introduced as proxies of the desired objectives, such that when the agent maximizes the accumulated reward, it also fulfills the task designer's intentions.

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of reward modeling techniques within the deep RL literature. We begin by outlining the background and preliminaries in reward modeling. Next, we present an overview of recent reward modeling approaches, categorizing them based on the source, the mechanism, and the learning paradigm. Building on this understanding, we discuss various applications of these reward modeling techniques and review methods for evaluating reward models.

Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods, however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient, per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k, PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches. On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup from 2.35x to 2.58x.

Current methods in this line posit that 1) normal nodes share a similar level of homophily and 2) the labeled normal nodes can well represent the homophily patterns in the normal class. However, this assumption often does not hold well since normal nodes in a graph can exhibit diverse homophily in real-world GAD datasets. In this paper, we propose RHO, namely Robust Homophily Learning, to adaptively learn such homophily patterns. RHO consists of two novel modules, adaptive frequency response filters (AdaFreq) and graph normality alignment (GNA). AdaFreq learns a set of adaptive spectral filters that capture different frequency components of the labeled normal nodes with varying homophily in the channel-wise and cross-channel views of node attributes. GNA is introduced to enforce consistency between the channel-wise and cross-channel homophily representations to robustify the normality learned by the filters in the two views. Experiments on eight real-world GAD datasets show that RHO can effectively learn varying, often under-represented, homophily in the small normal node set and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods.

Through detailed sensitivity analyses, we quantify the benefits of overlapping compute and communication, leveraging hardware-accelerated collectives, wider scale-out domains, and larger memory capacity. Our study spans both sparse (mixture of experts) and dense transformer-based LLMs, revealing how system design choices affect Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU = Model flops per token x Observed tokens per sec / Peak flops of the hardware) and overall throughput. For the co-design study, we extended and validated a performance modeling tool capable of predicting LLM runtime within 10% of real-world measurements.

Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods, demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is present (via a polysemanticity score).", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u591a\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5168\u9762\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4ec5\u7f16\u7801\u5355\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5355\u4e49\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e38\u4e3a\u591a\u4e49\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPRISM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4e49\u548c\u5355\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "PRISM\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u4e49\u6027\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that the introduction of sustainability metrics in the third test leads to more informed design decisions, however, it can also trigger decision fatigue and lower overall satisfaction.

However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning - even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations.

We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\\% relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a 6.1\\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset, compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference.

Ideally, training an SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful. However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \\emph{dense}), raising concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding, entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented signals in the last layers of the model.

This study investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI (T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2, while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53; Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining computational efficiency.

However, models may still rely on memorized training data, bypass the retrieved evidence, and produce contaminated outputs. We introduce Retrieval-Path Contamination Scoring (RePCS), a diagnostic method that detects such behavior without requiring model access or retraining. RePCS compares two inference paths: (i) a parametric path using only the query, and (ii) a retrieval-augmented path using both the query and retrieved context by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between their output distributions. A low divergence suggests that the retrieved context had minimal impact, indicating potential memorization. This procedure is model-agnostic, requires no gradient or internal state access, and adds only a single additional forward pass. We further derive PAC-style guarantees that link the KL threshold to user-defined false positive and false negative rates. On the Prompt-WNQA benchmark, RePCS achieves a ROC-AUC of 0.918. This result outperforms the strongest prior method by 6.5 percentage points while keeping latency overhead below 4.7% on an NVIDIA T4 GPU.

To address this gap, we developed Carey, a GPT-4o-based chatbot designed to provide informational and emotional support to AD/ADRD caregivers. Using Carey as a technology probe, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 family caregivers following scenario-driven interactions grounded in common caregiving stressors. Through inductive coding and reflexive thematic analysis, we surface a systemic understanding of caregiver needs and expectations across six themes -- on-demand information access, emotional support, safe space for disclosure, crisis management, personalization, and data privacy. For each of these themes, we also identified the nuanced tensions in the caregivers' desires and concerns. We present a mapping of caregiver needs, AI chatbot's strengths, gaps, and design recommendations.

This version matches the proceedings version", "summary": "This paper studies the problem of learning computable functions in the limit by extending Gold's inductive inference framework to incorporate \\textit{computational observations} and \\textit{restricted input sources}. Complimentary to the traditional Input-Output Observations, we introduce Time-Bound Observations, and Policy-Trajectory Observations to study the learnability of general recursive functions under more realistic constraints. While input-output observations do not suffice for learning the class of general recursive functions in the limit, we overcome this learning barrier by imposing computational complexity constraints or supplementing with approximate time-bound observations. Further, we build a formal framework around observations of \\textit{computational agents} and show that learning computable functions from policy trajectories reduces to learning rational functions from input and output, thereby revealing interesting connections to finite-state transducer inference. On the negative side, we show that computable or polynomial-mass characteristic sets cannot exist for the class of linear-time computable functions even for policy-trajectory observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55Gold\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u53d7\u9650\u8f93\u5165\u6e90\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6781\u9650\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\u4e00\u822c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5728\u6781\u9650\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u822c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Gold\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u56f4\u7ed5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u7406\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u89c2\u6d4b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u822c\u9012\u5f52\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u969c\u788d\u3002\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u7406\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u6216\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8d28\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

Bike-sharing systems (BSS) can bridge these equity gaps by providing affordable first- and last-mile connections. However, strategically expanding BSS into underserved neighborhoods is difficult due to uncertain bike-sharing demand at newly planned (\"cold-start\") station locations and limitations in traditional accessibility metrics that may overlook realistic bike usage potential. We introduce Transit for All (TFA), a spatial computing framework designed to guide the equitable expansion of BSS through three components: (1) spatially-informed bike-sharing demand prediction at cold-start stations using region representation learning that integrates multimodal geospatial data, (2) comprehensive transit accessibility assessment leveraging our novel weighted Public Transport Accessibility Level (wPTAL) by combining predicted bike-sharing demand with conventional transit accessibility metrics, and (3) strategic recommendations for new bike station placements that consider potential ridership and equity enhancement. Using NYC as a case study, we identify transit accessibility gaps that disproportionately impact low-income and minority communities in historically underserved neighborhoods. Our results show that strategically placing new stations guided by wPTAL notably reduces disparities in transit access related to economic and demographic factors.

We developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many other purposes.

Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.\n  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states.

This lack of interpretability hampers our ability to understand the impact of temporal variations - caused by environmental dynamics - and to adapt models for long-term reliability. To address this, we introduce LogNet, a novel logic gate-based framework designed to interpret and enhance DL-based indoor localization. LogNet enables transparent reasoning by identifying which access points (APs) are most influential for each reference point (RP) and reveals how environmental noise disrupts DL-driven localization decisions. This interpretability allows us to trace and diagnose model failures and adapt DL systems for more stable long-term deployments. Evaluations across multiple real-world building floorplans and over two years of temporal variation show that LogNet not only interprets the internal behavior of DL models but also improves performance-achieving up to 1.1x to 2.8x lower localization error, 3.4x to 43.3x smaller model size, and 1.5x to 3.6x lower latency compared to prior DL-based models.", "AI": {"tldr": "LogNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165LogNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08APs\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "LogNet\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u5e73\u9762\u548c\u4e24\u5e74\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e1.1x\u81f32.8x\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u7f29\u5c0f3.4x\u81f343.3x\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.5x\u81f33.6x\u3002", "conclusion": "LogNet\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

ACM Softw. Eng. 2, FSE", "summary": "Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation, data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz libraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause, which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries. Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in designing effective automated testing techniques.

In this paper, we design an large language model (LLM) agent for automatic hyper-parameters-tuning, where an iterative framework and model context protocol (MCP) are applied.

The DICOM headers of these series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121 model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than 0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and 0.810 accuracy for each.

We introduce DP-GRAPE (Gradient RAndom ProjEction), a DP training method that significantly reduces memory usage while maintaining utility on par with first-order DP approaches. Rather than directly applying DP to GaLore, DP-GRAPE introduces three key modifications: (1) gradients are privatized after projection, (2) random Gaussian matrices replace SVD-based subspaces, and (3) projection is applied during backpropagation. These contributions eliminate the need for costly SVD computations, enable substantial memory savings, and lead to improved utility. Despite operating in lower-dimensional subspaces, our theoretical analysis shows that DP-GRAPE achieves a privacy-utility trade-off comparable to DP-SGD. Our extensive empirical experiments show that DP-GRAPE can reduce the memory footprint of DP training without sacrificing accuracy or training time. In particular, DP-GRAPE reduces memory usage by over 63% when pre-training Vision Transformers and over 70% when fine-tuning RoBERTa-Large as compared to DP-Adam, while achieving similar performance.

Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive, particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks using vanilla CNN backbones.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference.

This study evaluates the performance of federated learning (FL) for BrainAGE estimation in ischemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, and investigates its association with clinical phenotypes and functional outcomes.\n  $\\textbf{Methods:}$ We used FLAIR brain images from 1674 stroke patients across 16 hospital centers. We implemented standard machine learning and deep learning models for BrainAGE estimates under three data management strategies: centralized learning (pooled data), FL (local training at each site), and single-site learning. We reported prediction errors and examined associations between BrainAGE and vascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking), as well as functional outcomes at three months post-stroke. Logistic regression evaluated BrainAGE's predictive value for these outcomes, adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, stroke severity, time between MRI and arterial puncture, prior intravenous thrombolysis, and recanalisation outcome.\n  $\\textbf{Results:}$ While centralized learning yielded the most accurate predictions, FL consistently outperformed single-site models. BrainAGE was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus across all models. Comparisons between patients with good and poor functional outcomes, and multivariate predictions of these outcomes showed the significance of the association between BrainAGE and post-stroke recovery.\n  $\\textbf{Conclusion:}$ FL enables accurate age predictions without data centralization.

To address these challenges, we propose FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI classification performance, and preserves patient privacy.

Recently, single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However, the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel, requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness. In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types: fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise. Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors.

We study it from two perspectives: (1) how poor explorations impact the theoretically optimal policy based on KL divergence, and (2) how such poor explorations affect the approximation of the theoretically optimal policy. We prove that such over-conservatism is mainly caused by the sensitivity of the loss function for policy optimization to poor explorations, and the proportion of poor explorations in offline datasets. To address this concern, we propose Corruption-Averse Advantage-Weighted Regression (CAWR), which incorporates a set of robust loss functions during policy optimization and an advantage-based prioritized experience replay method to filter out poor explorations.

While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch.

Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent.

We empirically test this framework using a human-AI interaction model based on the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), a decentralized Bayesian inference mechanism. In an online experiment, 69 participants played a joint attention naming game (JA-NG) with one of three computer agent types (MH-based, always-accept, or always-reject) under partial observability. Results show that human-AI pairs with an MH-based agent significantly improved categorization accuracy through interaction and achieved stronger convergence toward a shared sign system. Furthermore, human acceptance behavior aligned closely with the MH-derived acceptance probability. These findings provide the first empirical evidence for co-creative learning emerging in human-AI dyads via MHNG-based interaction.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on joint holistic embeddings, DisProtEdit explicitly separates semantic factors, enabling modular and interpretable control. To support this, we construct SwissProtDis, a large-scale multimodal dataset where each protein sequence is paired with two textual descriptions, one for structure and one for function, automatically decomposed using a large language model. DisProtEdit aligns protein and text embeddings using alignment and uniformity objectives, while a disentanglement loss promotes independence between structural and functional semantics. At inference time, protein editing is performed by modifying one or both text inputs and decoding from the updated latent representation. Experiments on protein editing and representation learning benchmarks demonstrate that DisProtEdit performs competitively with existing methods while providing improved interpretability and controllability.

The severe constraints of NISQ hardware, particularly in circuit depth and connectivity, hinder both the validation of quantum advantage and the empirical investigation of major obstacles like barren plateaus. Circuit cutting techniques have emerged as a strategy to execute larger quantum circuits on smaller, less connected hardware by dividing them into subcircuits. However, this partitioning increases the number of samples needed to estimate the expectation value accurately through classical post-processing compared to estimating it directly from the full circuit. This work introduces a novel regularization term into the QML optimization process, directly penalizing the overhead associated with sampling. We demonstrate that this approach enables the optimizer to balance the advantages of gate cutting against the optimization of the typical ML cost function.

While these systems are gaining popularity, their safety has been largely overlooked, despite the fact that evaluating and understanding their potential for harmful behavior is essential for widespread adoption. To address this gap, we introduce OS-Harm, a new benchmark for measuring safety of computer use agents. OS-Harm is built on top of the OSWorld environment and aims to test models across three categories of harm: deliberate user misuse, prompt injection attacks, and model misbehavior. To cover these cases, we create 150 tasks that span several types of safety violations (harassment, copyright infringement, disinformation, data exfiltration, etc.) and require the agent to interact with a variety of OS applications (email client, code editor, browser, etc.). Moreover, we propose an automated judge to evaluate both accuracy and safety of agents that achieves high agreement with human annotations (0.76 and 0.79 F1 score). We evaluate computer use agents based on a range of frontier models - such as o4-mini, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro - and provide insights into their safety. In particular, all models tend to directly comply with many deliberate misuse queries, are relatively vulnerable to static prompt injections, and occasionally perform unsafe actions.

This assumption requires the conditional class probability function of the data distribution to be the composition of $q+1$ vector-valued multivariate functions, where each component function is either a maximum value function or a H\u00f6lder-$\u03b2$ smooth function that depends only on $d_*$ of its input variables. Notably, $d_*$ can be significantly smaller than the input dimension $d$. We prove that, under these conditions, the optimal convergence rate for the excess 0-1 risk of classifiers is $$ \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^{\\frac{\u03b2\\cdot(1\\wedge\u03b2)^q}{{\\frac{d_*}{s+1}+(1+\\frac{1}{s+1})\\cdot\u03b2\\cdot(1\\wedge\u03b2)^q}}}\\;\\;\\;, $$ which is independent of the input dimension $d$. Additionally, we demonstrate that ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with hinge loss can achieve this optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor.

Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p < 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme.

Theoretical evidence for invariance of the self-attention mechanism to softmax activation is obtained by appealing to paradifferential calculus, (and is supported by computational examples), which relies on the intrinsic organization of the attention heads. Furthermore, we use an existing methodology for hierarchical organization of tensors to examine network structure by constructing hierarchal partition trees with respect to the query, key, and head axes of network 3-tensors. Such an organization is consequential since it allows one to profitably execute common signal processing tasks on a geometry where the organized network 3-tensors exhibit regularity. We exemplify this qualitatively, by visualizing the hierarchical organization of the tree comprised of attention heads and the diffusion map embeddings, and quantitatively by investigating network sparsity with the expansion coefficients of individual attention heads and the entire network with respect to the bi and tri-haar bases (respectively) on the space of queries, keys, and heads of the network.

Models implement safeguards to protect against potential misuse relevant to NSPS and allow for benign users to receive helpful information. However, current benchmarks often fail to test safeguard robustness to potential NSPS risks in an objective, robust way. We introduce FORTRESS: 500 expert-crafted adversarial prompts with instance-based rubrics of 4-7 binary questions for automated evaluation across 3 domains (unclassified information only): Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE), Political Violence & Terrorism, and Criminal & Financial Illicit Activities, with 10 total subcategories across these domains. Each prompt-rubric pair has a corresponding benign version to test for model over-refusals. This evaluation of frontier LLMs' safeguard robustness reveals varying trade-offs between potential risks and model usefulness: Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrates a low average risk score (ARS) (14.09 out of 100) but the highest over-refusal score (ORS) (21.8 out of 100), while Gemini 2.5 Pro shows low over-refusal (1.4) but a high average potential risk (66.29). Deepseek-R1 has the highest ARS at 78.05, but the lowest ORS at only 0.06. Models such as o1 display a more even trade-off between potential risks and over-refusals (with an ARS of 21.69 and ORS of 5.2).

Vibration-based structural health monitoring offers a valuable approach to assessing structural integrity and understanding the structural implications of these impacts. However, practical limitations often restrict sensor placement at critical locations. Consequently, virtual sensing techniques become essential for establishing a Digital Twin and estimating the structural response. This study investigates the application of the Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) for virtual sensing on the Magerholm ferry quay, combining in-operation experimental data collected during a ferry impact with a detailed physics-based model. The proposed Physics-Encoded Machine Learning model integrates a reduced-order structural model with a data-driven GPLFM representing the unknown impact forces via their modal contributions. Significant challenges are addressed for the development of the Digital Twin of the ferry quay, including unknown impact characteristics (location, direction, intensity), time-varying boundary conditions, and sparse sensor configurations. Results show that the GPLFM provides accurate acceleration response estimates at most locations, even under simplifying modeling assumptions such as linear time-invariant behavior during the impact phase. Lower accuracy was observed at locations in the impact zone. A numerical study was conducted to explore an optimal real-world sensor placement strategy using a Backward Sequential Sensor Placement approach. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the influence of sensor types, sampling frequencies, and incorrectly assumed damping ratios.

Specifically, many techniques for causal inference, such as instrumental variable (IV) regression and proximal causal learning (PCL), are CMR problems. Most CMR estimators use a two-stage approach, where the first-stage estimation is directly plugged into the second stage to estimate the function of interest. However, naively plugging in the first-stage estimator can cause heavy bias in the second stage. This is particularly the case for recently proposed CMR estimators that use deep neural network (DNN) estimators for both stages, where regularisation and overfitting bias is present. We propose DML-CMR, a two-stage CMR estimator that provides an unbiased estimate with fast convergence rate guarantees.

While recent models of population activity emphasize interpretability and behavioral decoding, neural forecasting-particularly across multi-session, spontaneous recordings-remains underexplored. We introduce POCO, a unified forecasting model that combines a lightweight univariate forecaster with a population-level encoder to capture both neuron-specific and brain-wide dynamics. Trained across five calcium imaging datasets spanning zebrafish, mice, and C. elegans, POCO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at cellular resolution in spontaneous behaviors. After pre-training, POCO rapidly adapts to new recordings with minimal fine-tuning. Notably, POCO's learned unit embeddings recover biologically meaningful structure-such as brain region clustering-without any anatomical labels. Our comprehensive analysis reveals several key factors influencing performance, including context length, session diversity, and preprocessing. Together, these results position POCO as a scalable and adaptable approach for cross-session neural forecasting and offer actionable insights for future model design.

Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\u03b1> 0$ and $t\\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\\log^{2+2\u03b1}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\\log(n)\\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \\log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al.

Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4fe1\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u7684ICL\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "ICL\u5728\u65e0\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfc\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To this end, we investigate sorted nonsmooth penalties as a regularization approach for generalized linear models. We focus on a family of sorted nonconvex penalties which generalizes the Sorted L1 Norm (SLOPE). These penalties are designed to promote clustering of variables due to their sorted nature, while the nonconvexity reduces the shrinkage of coefficients. Our goal is to provide efficient ways to compute their proximal operator, enabling the use of popular proximal algorithms to solve composite optimization problems with this choice of sorted penalties. We distinguish between two classes of problems: the weakly convex case where computing the proximal operator remains a convex problem, and the nonconvex case where computing the proximal operator becomes a challenging nonconvex combinatorial problem. For the weakly convex case (e.g. sorted MCP and SCAD), we explain how the Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV) algorithm can exactly compute the proximal operator. For the nonconvex case (e.g. sorted Lq with q in ]0,1[), we show that a slight modification of this algorithm turns out to be remarkably efficient to tackle the computation of the proximal operator.

Consequently, the recourse algorithm may render its own recommendations invalid, such that applicants who make the effort of implementing their recommendations may be rejected again when they reapply. In this work, we formally characterize the conditions under which recourse explanations remain valid under performativity.

The inevitable challenge here is the churn of nodes due to failures and the operator's scheduling policies, leading to losing a stage - a part of the model. The conventional approaches to recover from failures are to either use checkpointing, where periodically a copy of the entire model is sent to an additional storage, or redundant computation. These approaches yield significant communication and/or computation overhead even in non-failure cases and scale poorly in settings with large models. In this paper, we propose, CheckFree, an efficient recovery method where a failing stage is substituted by a weighted average of the closest neighboring stages. In contrast to the state of the art, CheckFree requires no additional computation or storage. However, because of the nature of averaging neighbouring stages, it can only recover failures of intermediate stages. We further extend our method to CheckFree+ with out-of-order pipeline execution to tolerate crashes of the first and last stages. Thanks to out-of-order pipelining, behaviour of those stages is mimicked by their neighboring ones, which allows CheckFree+ to recover them by simply copying the weights from the immediate neighbour. To be able to recover the (de)embedding layers, CheckFree+ copies those layers to the neighboring stages, which requires relatively small storage overhead.

Our method uses a novel time-dependent binary classifier trained using a contrastive estimation-based objective that trains the classifier to discriminate between realizations of the stochastic process at two nearby time instants. Significantly, the proposed method explicitly models the time-dependent probability distribution, which means that it is possible to obtain the value of the probability density within the time horizon of interest. Additionally, the input before the final activation in the time-dependent classifier is a second-order approximation to the partial derivative, with respect to time, of the logarithm of the density. We apply the proposed approach to approximate the time-dependent probability density functions for systems driven by stochastic excitations. We also use the proposed approach to synthesize new samples of a random vector from a given set of its realizations. In such applications, we generate sample paths necessary for training using stochastic interpolants. Subsequently, new samples are generated using gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods because automatic differentiation can efficiently provide the necessary gradient. Further, we demonstrate the utility of an explicit approximation to the time-dependent probability density function through applications in unsupervised outlier detection.

Furthermore, the mechanism by which this improves predictive performance is poorly understood. We address these issues in the context of sparse linear regression by proposing and analyzing an ensemble of greedy forward selection estimators that are randomized by feature subsampling -- at each iteration, the best feature is selected from within a random subset. We design a novel implementation based on dynamic programming that greatly improves its computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show via careful numerical experiments that our method can outperform popular methods such as lasso and elastic net across a wide range of settings. Next, contrary to prevailing belief that randomized ensembling is analogous to shrinkage, we show via numerical experiments that it can simultaneously reduce training error and degrees of freedom, thereby shifting the entire bias-variance trade-off curve of the base estimator. We prove this fact rigorously in the setting of orthogonal features, in which case, the ensemble estimator rescales the ordinary least squares coefficients with a two-parameter family of logistic weights, thereby enlarging the model search space.

Our method is especially effective for matrices with fast-decaying spectra, such as those arising in deep learning and inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Counterbalance\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u8c31\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5e42\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u77e9\u9635\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9488\u5bf9\u8c31\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u77e9\u9635\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCounterbalance\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e9\u9635-\u5411\u91cf\u4e58\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u5176\u4f4e\u4f30\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5e42\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "Counterbalance\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u8c31\u5feb\u901f\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The proposed framework consists of two main steps. In the first step, input-output experiments are designed to generate the necessary datasets for learning the system dynamics, including the fractional order, the drift vector field, and the control vector field. In the second step, these datasets, along with the memory-dependent property of fractional-order systems, are used to estimate the system's fractional order. The drift and control vector fields are then reconstructed using orthonormal basis functions. To validate the proposed approach, the algorithm is applied to four benchmark fractional-order systems. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning the system dynamics accurately. Finally, the same datasets are used to learn equivalent integer-order models. The numerical comparisons demonstrate that fractional-order models better capture long-range dependencies, highlighting the limitations of integer-order representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u6570\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u6570\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5b9e\u9a8c\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u91cd\u5efa\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u5206\u6570\u9636\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u6574\u6570\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6570\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6574\u6570\u9636\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks. Their application to physical assets in real-world\nenvironments, however, remains underexplored. In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment. It employs a multi-agent system comprising a\nhead agent and multiple worker agents, each controlling a single drone. The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency. By leveraging natural language processing for agent\ncommunication, our approach offers a novel, flexible, and user-accessible\nalternative to traditional drone-based solutions, enabling autonomous\nproblem-solving for industrial inspection without extensive user intervention."}

The proposed framework is fully compatible with\nall types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further\nimprove compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques\nfor Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a\nper-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a\nsingle model yields better compression results than using a single method\nuniformly across all layers.

Applying this pipeline to\nrecordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned\nspeech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages\nexceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech\ndata.

This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff.

In this work, we address this problem by\nanalyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips\nimprove conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be\nrecovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this\ninsight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient\ntraining of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.\nWe validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and\nself-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our\ninitialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer\nhierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate\nskip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks.

In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via\nSelective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions\nfrom LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e.\nsearch tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help\n(search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer\naccuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a\npay-per-search reward.\n  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show\nthat MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of\nprior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer\naccuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf\nabstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and\nselectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior\nanalogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to\nprior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge\nboundaries to construct training data.

Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation\nof existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,\npreventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,\nmale vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into\nseparate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To\naddress this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the\n$\\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the\nlargest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative\nactivations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.\nComprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks\nshow that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,\nand enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK\nmatches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach\nthat requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to\noutperform SAEs."}

Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a\npromising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and\nfacial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements\nof the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and\nunbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,\nresource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with\nsimplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG\nchannels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion\nprediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped\nEEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data\ninto scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion\nclassification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4\nquadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points\n(also referred to as channels).

Our approach\nleverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering\nalgorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test\ncomprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions\ninto a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage\nmetrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question\ncoverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant\nquestions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from\ntwo distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies\ntest coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate\nrepresentation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,\nhigh-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential\ntools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability\nand extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents."}

To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel\nevaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground\ntruth images.

Recent advances in selective SSMs like\nMamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state\ntransitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while\nmaintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,\nMamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its\ncausal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for\nspatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient\ntemporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an\nalignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame\nwithin the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back\nafterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective\nredistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official\nimplementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba."}

AutoPK, a novel two-stage\nframework for accurate and scalable extraction of PK data from complex\nscientific tables. In the first stage, AutoPK identifies and extracts PK\nparameter variants using large language models (LLMs), a hybrid similarity\nmetric, and LLM-based validation.

In this work, we take\na different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent\nof unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness.

Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with\nrandomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust\nunlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness.

It operates by\nlinearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a\nguidance weight $\\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve\nvisual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional\nalignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,\nwe instead learn guidance weights $\\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous\nfunctions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the\ntime $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the\ndistributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional\ndistribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our\nframework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions\ntilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a\nconditioning $c$.

We evaluate on two cohorts: a large healthy-control dataset (n=6527)\nwith chronological age, and a clinical multiple sclerosis dataset from Charles\nUniversity in Prague (n=904) with age and Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)\nscores. The learned latents support accurate brain-age and SDMT regression,\npreserve key medical attributes, and form intuitive clusters that aid\ninterpretation. Across reconstruction and downstream prediction tasks,\nInfoVAE-Med3D consistently outperforms other VAE variants, indicating stronger\ninformation capture in the embedding space. By uniting predictive performance\nwith interpretability, InfoVAE-Med3D offers a practical path toward MRI-based\nbiomarkers and more transparent analysis of cognitive deterioration in\nneurological disease."}

However, these\ndeterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as\nhandling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly\nwhen generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how\na deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial\nNetwork (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from\na collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines\nCT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The\nresearch evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel\nsurvey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the\nstand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the\nhybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match\nsingle-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships\nbetween multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved\nperformance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a\ndescriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with\ntarget-year marginals.

However, for practical\nproblems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due\nto computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human\nfeedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --\nonly a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question\narises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We\nformalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from\nlimited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates\nthe study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection\nstrategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free\ninformation such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)\nstrategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that\ncritical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal\ntrajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after\ndeviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with\nsignificantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward\nselection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in\nfeedback-limited settings."}

Specifically, we introduce\na Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over\nmultiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient\nsignals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We\nfurther design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into\nbundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and\ninformative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse\nupdate alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,\nRiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical\nreasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing\nGRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics.

Our goal is to minimize the total number of\ncostly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of\nmisclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\\alpha$,\nwith probability at least $1-\\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel\nalgorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to\nestimate both $\\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a\nconservative, data-driven threshold $\\tau_t$ on the logistic score\n$|x_t^\\top\\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with\nprobability at least $1-\\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target\nmisclassification rate, and requires only $O(\\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared\nto the oracle baseline that knows both $\\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature\ndistribution $P$.

Methods: The authors propose a new method for\nsearching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method\nconsisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a\nuser-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose\nencoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method,\nsummed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular\nregions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D\noffset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to\ncubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even\nif they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric\nwere compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor\nImage Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the\nproposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional\ncomputation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search\nmetrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were\nhigher than those of the conventional metric.

First, we find that the improvements\narise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near\nzero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations\nincrease. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by\nsuppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module\n(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations\ndirectly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies\nnear-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,\nimplicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a\ncontrolled manner.

Recently, agentic frameworks have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for automating inspection workflows but have been limited\nto digital tasks.

In this work, our contributions\nare two-fold: first, we propose a hierarchical agentic framework for autonomous\ndrone control, and second, a reasoning methodology for individual function\nexecutions which we refer to as ReActEval. Our framework focuses on visual\ninspection tasks in indoor industrial settings, such as interpreting industrial\nreadouts or inspecting equipment.

The\nhead agent performs high-level planning and evaluates outcomes, while worker\nagents implement ReActEval to reason over and execute low-level actions.\nOperating entirely in natural language, ReActEval follows a plan, reason, act,\nevaluate cycle, enabling drones to handle tasks ranging from simple navigation\n(e.g., flying forward 10 meters and land) to complex high-level tasks (e.g.,\nlocating and reading a pressure gauge). The evaluation phase serves as a\nfeedback and/or replanning stage, ensuring actions align with user objectives\nwhile preventing undesirable outcomes. We evaluate the framework in a simulated\nenvironment with two worker agents, assessing performance qualitatively and\nquantitatively based on task completion across varying complexity levels and\nworkflow efficiency.

One such example is text revision, which involves\nnuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for\nrevision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision\nannotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of\nimportant LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm\ndistribution, while freezing those of redundant layers.

Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust\nPolicy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights\nto suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.\nNotably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high\nstaleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance\ntokens while maintaining stable optimization.

In this work, we\nintegrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets\nsampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation\ntoward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to\nbalance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a\ncontrollable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness.

In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm\nActivation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input\nfeatures from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the\nmodel that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in\nmechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust\nexplanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the\nConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We\nprovide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model\narchitectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations\nachieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,\nand confidence drop-off.

This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of\nalternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into\nthe mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a\nsimple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging\nexisting policies."}

This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,\ntoken/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage\ntheir metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,\ne.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we\nview the model as an improvement operator on its own \"thoughts\" with a\ncontinuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family\nParallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate\ndiverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual\nworkspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output\nthat seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is\ncontrollable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the\ntotal number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current\nmodels that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.\nSetting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential\nRefinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides\nperformance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises\nthe question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this\nend, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it\nconsistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable\nanswers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched\nsequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME\n2024 and +9% on AIME 2025)."}

The power output is highly related to the wind speed on\nspatial and temporal levels, which can be modeled by advanced data-driven\napproaches. To this end, we use a probabilistic neural network as a surrogate\nthat accounts for the spatiotemporal correlations of wind speed. This neural\nnetwork uses ReLU activation functions so that it can be reformulated as\nmixed-integer linear set of constraints (constraint learning). We embed these\nconstraints into the placement decision problem, formulated as a two-stage\nstochastic optimization problem. Specifically, conditional quantiles of the\ntotal electricity production are regarded as recursive decisions in the second\nstage. We use real high-resolution regional data from a northern region in\nSpain. We validate that the constraint learning approach outperforms the\nclassical bilinear interpolation method. Numerical experiments are implemented\non risk-averse investors. The results indicate that risk-averse investors\nconcentrate on dominant sites with strong wind, while exhibiting spatial\ndiversification and sensitive capacity spread in non-dominant sites.\nFurthermore, we show that if we introduce transmission line costs in the\nproblem, risk-averse investors favor locations closer to the substations. On\nthe contrary, risk-neutral investors are willing to move to further locations\nto achieve higher expected profits. Our results conclude that the proposed\nnovel approach is able to tackle a portfolio of regional wind farm placements\nand further provide guidance for risk-averse investors."}

Central to our approach is an encoder model that\ntransforms audio signals into latent facial expression sequences in real time,\nwhich are then decoded as photorealistic 3D facial avatars. Leveraging the\ngenerative capabilities of diffusion models, we capture the rich spectrum of\nfacial expressions necessary for natural communication while achieving\nreal-time performance (<15ms GPU time). Our novel architecture minimizes\nlatency through two key innovations: an online transformer that eliminates\ndependency on future inputs and a distillation pipeline that accelerates\niterative denoising into a single step. We further address critical design\nchallenges in live scenarios for processing continuous audio signals\nframe-by-frame while maintaining consistent animation quality. The versatility\nof our framework extends to multimodal applications, including semantic\nmodalities such as emotion conditions and multimodal sensors with head-mounted\neye cameras on VR headsets. Experimental results demonstrate significant\nimprovements in facial animation accuracy over existing offline\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving 100 to 1000 times faster inference speed.\nWe validate our approach through live VR demonstrations and across various\nscenarios such as multilingual speeches."}

Code is available at\n  https://github.com/CHATS-lab/verbalize-sampling", "summary": "Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon\nknown as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to\nalgorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level\ndriver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically\nfavor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive\npsychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference\ndatasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.\nMotivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,\ntraining-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the\nmodel to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g.,\n``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities'').\nComprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance\nacross creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation,\nopen-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual\naccuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity\nby 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that\nmore capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new\ndata-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy\nthat helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity."}

Existing methods for detecting and attributing AI-generated\nimages are insufficient for this problem, as they focus on determining whether\nan image was AI-generated/edited rather than whether it was edited from a\nparticular base image. To bridge this gap, we propose EditTrack, the first\nframework for this image-editing detection and attribution problem. Building on\nfour key observations about the editing process, EditTrack introduces a novel\nre-editing strategy and leverages carefully designed similarity metrics to\ndetermine whether a suspicious image originates from a base image and, if so,\nby which model. We evaluate EditTrack on five state-of-the-art editing models\nacross six datasets, demonstrating that it consistently achieves accurate\ndetection and attribution, significantly outperforming five baselines."}

Intuitively, such\nrequirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable\nenvironment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,\ncode). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for\ngenerating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

In this paper, we formulate\nexemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly\ntargeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of\nexpected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient\nCombinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto\nfront that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.\nWe evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and\nfind that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two\nobjectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls."}

Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and\ncomplexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To\naddress this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available\ntool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized\nfrom nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,\nToucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and\nchallenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline\nfirst produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,\napplies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories\nwith three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and\nmodel-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three\nextension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn\nconversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source\ncounterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on\nMCP-Universe Bench."}

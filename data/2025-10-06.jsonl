To represent and manipulate these complex objects, various\nformats have been tailored for different use cases. While music notation\nfollows specific rules, digital formats usually enforce them leniently. Hence,\ndigital music scores widely vary in quality, due to software and format\nspecificity, conversion issues, and dubious user inputs. Problems range from\nminor engraving discrepancies to major notation mistakes. Yet, data quality is\na major issue when dealing with musical information extraction and retrieval.\nWe present an automated approach to detect notational errors, aiming at\nprecisely localizing defects in scores. We identify two types of errors: i)\nrhythm/time inconsistencies in the encoding of individual musical elements, and\nii) contextual errors, i.e. notation mistakes that break commonly accepted\nmusical rules. We implement the latter using a modular state machine that can\nbe easily extended to include rules representing the usual conventions from the\ncommon Western music notation. Finally, we apply this error-detection method to\nthe piano score dataset ASAP. We highlight that around 40% of the scores\ncontain at least one notational error, and manually fix multiple of them to\nenhance the dataset's quality."}

A common strategy consists\nin retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to\nmitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the\ncontinually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)\nreliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance\ndegradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.\nIn this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more\nexpressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose\nreparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected\nfunctions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA.

However, there is little consensus on the correct method for\ncomparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in\nphilosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the\nInter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to\naccurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using\nthe IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and\nbrain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject\nusing the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We\nidentify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network\nmodels, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We\nfind that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as\nthe non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC\nenables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high\nspecificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate\nresponse patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning\nsame-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a\nproof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural\nengineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal\nof identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided\ntransforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural\nnetworks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables\nprincipled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the\npredictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon\nprevious approaches to model-brain comparison."}

We introduce a\nunified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression\nto address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering\nprocedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter\nand activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our\nknowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic\nembedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's\narchitecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each\ncluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely\nlow-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per\ngroup while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage\nhierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to\nspecific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and\nthe volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision\nscheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled\nwith dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption\nto levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our\nframework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total\nparameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and\nlowering expert load variance by a factor of over three.

In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the\nbest-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only\nand tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble\napproach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in\nfreshness prediction.

Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution\n(OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in\nboth text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first\nsteering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both\ndense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models.

LPG-Bench\nfeatures 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250\nwords, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.\nUsing these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models\nand further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,\nwe observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor\nconsistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To\naddress the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on\ntext-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating\nlong-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I\nalignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the\nLMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient\nscore-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based\ninstantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to\nCLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute\nimprovement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT\nmethods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the\ndevelopment of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available."}

However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary\ninformation to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on\nnode-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding\naugmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding\naugmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all\ncontrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences\nbetween hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits\ntheir discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust\nattributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative\naugmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness\n(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding\nrepresentations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a\nmore comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive\nlearning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides\nedge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high\nconfidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively\nidentifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an\ninnovative weight modulation function.

Existing generative methods rely\nsolely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or\ndepth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion.

With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from\nsocial media, automated methods for personality assessment have become\nincreasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis\nof unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main\nchallenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large,\npersonality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology\nand NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these\nchallenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA --\ncollected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse\ndiscussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000\nusers and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic\ninformation, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage.\nExperiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model\nvalidity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality\nAssessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for\ninterpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements\nwith validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic\nsimilarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human\nevaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency.

Speculative decoding addresses this by\nemploying a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified\nin parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR\ndrafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the\ndrafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that\nuses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts\nin a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR\nverifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning,\nparallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally\nhighest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right\npath. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a\nspeed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two\npractical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this\nlattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and\n(ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size\nbased on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length.

However, existing self-reflection either performs\nrevisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training,\nboth fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose\nSelf-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time\nframework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token\ngeneration, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify\nhigh-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific\ncorrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a\nself-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By\nretrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more\ntrustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors\nat highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model\nreasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger\nself-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with\nDeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on\nPass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5.

This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses\nphysical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and\nshort temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy\nperturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates\nspatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU\nmodels short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous\nfeatures into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for\nclassification.

This vulnerability is characterized by two core\naspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated\nwithin a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory\nentries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can\ninitiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as\nprecedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively\nlowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive\ndefense framework for LLM agent memory.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems.

One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density.

Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit.

In this work, we conduct the first large-scale,\nsystematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and\nover 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from\nsystematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's\ninternal representations and find that the final layer, biased by\nEnglish-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence.\nIn contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that\nlate-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and\nbetter-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of\ntraining-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE),\nwhich adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific\nlanguage.

By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational\nconvergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned\nrepresentations between models which have been trained on distinct data and\nmodalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned\nrepresentations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful\nimages has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially\nconstructed values.

A shortcut\nto achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the\ntraining data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark\ncontamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination\ndetections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where\ncontamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM\nvia SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally\nidentified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training\ncan markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on.\nFurther empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style\nimportance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this\ndetection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may\ninherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination\nwith CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination\ndetection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members,\ncontaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those\nunseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus,\nevade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings\nreveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could\neasily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while\nleaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the\nfairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards.\nThis underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods\nand trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs."}

We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated\ndecoding strategies?\n  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which\nuses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness\nto verifier errors.

We attribute the\ncontradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance\nto their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides\nintermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce\nadditional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the\ncontinuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous\nDiscrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process\non the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space,\nleveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space.

Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence.

We\npropose a heterogeneous graph representation of stiffened panels that accounts\nfor geometrical variability, non-uniform boundary conditions, and diverse\nloading scenarios, using heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs). The\nstructure is partitioned into multiple structural units, such as stiffeners and\nthe plates between them, with each unit represented by three distinct node\ntypes: geometry, boundary, and loading nodes. Edge heterogeneity is introduced\nby incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting\nnodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees\nof heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are\nimplemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises\nstress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and\ndegrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach,\nwe conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams\ncomposed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The\nheterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart,\ndemonstrating superior performance.

In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in\nthis field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)\nbecomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.\nIndeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the\nmiscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To\nevaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically\nconsidered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width\nminimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run\ncoverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals.

Given (discrete observations of) samples\nof a fixed underlying It\\^o process, the NJODE framework can be used to\napproximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process. Under standard\nregularity assumptions on the It\\^o processes, we prove that, in the limit, we\nrecover the true parameters with our approximation. Hence, using these learned\ncoefficients to sample from the corresponding It\\^o process generates, in the\nlimit, samples with the same law as the true underlying process. Compared to\nother generative machine learning models, our approach has the advantage that\nit does not need adversarial training and can be trained solely as a predictive\nmodel on the observed samples without the need to generate any samples during\ntraining to empirically approximate the distribution. Moreover, the NJODE\nframework naturally deals with irregularly sampled data with missing values as\nwell as with path-dependent dynamics, allowing to apply this approach in\nreal-world settings. In particular, in the case of path-dependent coefficients\nof the It\\^o processes, the NJODE learns their optimal approximation given the\npast observations and therefore allows generating new paths conditionally on\ndiscrete, irregular, and incomplete past observations in an optimal way."}

We find that code\ncorrectness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while\ncorrection capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs\nbetween fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful\ncode generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem\ndescriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their\neffectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms\nlearned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic\ninsights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should\nprioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor\ndirections can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same\npredictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are\nanticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering."}

Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache\nsemantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size,\nsupporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus,\nwe propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic\ncommunication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the\nsource model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic\ntransfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit\nfrom cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the\ndeep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit\nintermediate text generation.

However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem\nfiles satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain\nfiles, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely\non human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access\nfor refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can\nautonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual\nplanning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A\nSimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and\na GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the\nPDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of\ngeneralizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the\ndifferent instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different\nproblems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world\ndomains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game\nrules.

We\nintroduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug\nabstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the\nagentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that\nare unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug.

These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%.

We evaluate the\nresulting MAB policies in 166,000 practice sessions, verifying significant\nimprovements in student outcomes. While MAB policies optimize feedback for the\noverall student population, we further investigate whether contextual bandit\n(CB) policies can enhance outcomes by personalizing feedback based on\nindividual student features (e.g., ability estimates, response times). Using\ncausal inference, we examine (i) how effects of assistance actions vary across\nstudents and (ii) whether CB policies, which leverage such effect\nheterogeneity, outperform MAB policies. While our analysis reveals that some\nactions for some questions exhibit effect heterogeneity, effect sizes may often\nbe too small for CB policies to provide significant improvements beyond what\nwell-optimized MAB policies that deliver the same action to all students\nalready achieve. We discuss insights gained from deploying data-driven systems\nat scale and implications for future refinements. Today, the teaching policies\noptimized by our system support thousands of students daily."}

However, constrained by\nlimited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity\nfor adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in\nhandling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose\nthe first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It\nintegrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based\nHand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt\nstrategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip\nRecognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand\nPrompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip\nfeatures during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction\nPhoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from\nphoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through\nsemantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS\ndataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a\nmixed dataset of fourteen subjects.

Mamba, as an emerging state space model with\ninherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable\nfor processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features.

The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot\nmaintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of\nseverely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the\nhidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the\nunderstanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first\nMamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two\ninnovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to\nmigrate Mamba to the underwater task.

Recently, generalist graph anomaly detection (GAD) models have shown\npromising results. They are pretrained on multiple source datasets and\ngeneralize across domains. While effective on static graphs, they struggle to\ncapture evolving anomalies in dynamic graphs. Moreover, the continuous\nemergence of new domains and the lack of labeled data further challenge\ngeneralist DGAD. Effective cross-domain DGAD requires both domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic anomalous patterns. Importantly, these patterns evolve\ntemporally within and across domains. Building on these insights, we propose a\nDGAD model with Dynamic Prototypes (DP) to capture evolving domain-specific and\ndomain-agnostic patterns. Firstly, DP-DGAD extracts dynamic prototypes, i.e.,\nevolving representations of normal and anomalous patterns, from temporal\nego-graphs and stores them in a memory buffer. The buffer is selectively\nupdated to retain general, domain-agnostic patterns while incorporating new\ndomain-specific ones. Then, an anomaly scorer compares incoming data with\ndynamic prototypes to flag both general and domain-specific anomalies. Finally,\nDP-DGAD employs confidence-based pseudo-labeling for effective self-supervised\nadaptation in target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance across ten real-world datasets from different\ndomains."}

Evaluated on challenging\nknowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp,\nMetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or\nexceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving\nagentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery.

Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually\ndeployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data\nprivacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications.\nGiven the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical\nissue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an\nappropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable\nquality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously\naddress the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and\nthe dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet\nthese challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM\nservices.

Central to our approach\nis a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled\nalignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data\ndistribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance\nsemantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses\nmulti-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification\nprocess. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and\naround 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time\nadversarial purification."}

With the development of deep learning\ntechnologies, adopting pre-trained models for this task has become mainstream.\nConsidering the retrieval efficiency, most of the previous approaches adopt a\ndual-encoder for this task, which encodes the description and code snippet into\nrepresentation vectors, respectively. However, the model structure of the\ndual-encoder tends to limit the model's performance, since it lacks the\ninteraction between the code snippet and description at the bottom layer of the\nmodel during training. To improve the model's effectiveness while preserving\nits efficiency, we propose a framework, which adopts Self-AdaPtive Model\nDistillation for Efficient CodE Retrieval, named SPENCER. SPENCER first adopts\nthe dual-encoder to narrow the search space and then adopts the cross-encoder\nto improve accuracy. To improve the efficiency of SPENCER, we propose a novel\nmodel distillation technique, which can greatly reduce the inference time of\nthe dual-encoder while maintaining the overall performance. We also propose a\nteaching assistant selection strategy for our model distillation, which can\nadaptively select the suitable teaching assistant models for different\npre-trained models during the model distillation to ensure the model\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of\ndual-encoder and cross-encoder improves overall performance compared to solely\ndual-encoder-based models for code retrieval.

Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or\nmodular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot\nfully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and\nthe goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image\nin 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian\n(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS\noptimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly\nleveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is\nprohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D\nGaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal\nnavigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as\nnew images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely\nlocalize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space\nmatching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution.

The\nsecond is a framework for reshaping how learners reason about, learn and\nparticipate in QIS practices through shifts in knowledge representations that\nprovide new forms of engagement and associated learning. We call for a two-way\npartnership between quantum information science and the learning sciences, one\nthat not only supports learning in quantum concepts and practices but also\nimproves our understanding of how to teach and support learning in highly\ncomplex domains. We also consider potential questions involved in bridging\nthese disciplinary communities and argue that the theoretical and practical\nbenefits justify the effort."}

A\nfolklore result in machine learning conflates the construction of a\ndisintegration with the restriction of probability density functions onto the\nsubset of events that are consistent with a given observation. We provide a\ncomprehensive set of mathematical tools which can be used to construct\ndisintegrations and apply these to find densities of disintegrations on\ndifferentiable manifolds. Using our results, we provide a disturbingly simple\nexample in which the restricted density and the disintegration density\ndrastically disagree. Motivated by applications in approximate Bayesian\ninference and Bayesian inverse problems, we further study the modes of\ndisintegrations. We show that the recently introduced notion of a \"conditional\nmode\" does not coincide in general with the modes of the conditional measure\nobtained through disintegration, but rather the modes of the restricted\nmeasure. We also discuss the implications of the discrepancy between the two\nmeasures in practice, advocating for the utility of both approaches depending\non the modelling context."}

These avatars allow for more\nimmersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One\nemerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's\navatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to\ndetect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore\nthe challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our\nmain question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as\nreliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's\nvisual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we\nintroduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a\nstate-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and\nimpostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable\nspatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal\nattention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial\ngestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable\nmeaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed\nbenchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in\norder to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral\nbiometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems."}

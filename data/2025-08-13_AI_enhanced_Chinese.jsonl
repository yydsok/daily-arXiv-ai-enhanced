Therefore, we construct MERP\n(Multi-class Error in Robotic Prostatectomy), a comprehensive dataset for error\ndetection in robotic prostatectomy with frame-level annotations featuring six\nclinically aligned error categories. In addition, we propose CARES\n(Collaborative Agentic Reasoning for Error Detection in Surgery), a novel\nzero-shot clinically-informed and risk-stratified agentic reasoning\narchitecture for multi-class surgical error detection. CARES implements\nadaptive generation of medically informed, error-specific Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompts across multiple expertise levels. The framework employs\nrisk-aware routing to assign error task to expertise-matched reasoning pathways\nbased on complexity and clinical impact. Subsequently, each pathway decomposes\nsurgical error analysis into three specialized agents with temporal, spatial,\nand procedural analysis. Each agent analyzes using dynamically selected prompts\ntailored to the assigned expertise level and error type, generating detailed\nand transparent reasoning traces. By incorporating clinically informed\nreasoning from established surgical assessment guidelines, CARES enables\nzero-shot surgical error detection without prior training. Evaluation\ndemonstrates superior performance with 54.3 mF1 on RARP and 52.0 mF1 on MERP\ndatasets, outperforming existing zero-shot approaches by up to 14% while\nremaining competitive with trained models.

However, in real-world\ndeployments, failures of computational components are inevitable, presenting a\ncritical challenge: ensuring that multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\npolicies remain effective even when some agents malfunction. We propose the\nMulti-Agent Robust Training Algorithm (MARTA), a plug-and-play framework for\ntraining MARL agents to be resilient to potentially severe faults.

To ensure practicality, MARTA enforces a malfunction\nbudget, constraining the adversary to a fixed number of failures and learning\nrobust policies accordingly. We provide theoretical guarantees that MARTA\nconverges to a Markov perfect equilibrium, ensuring agents optimally counteract\nworst-case faults.

The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are\ncentral to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject\nclassifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which\ncreates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary\ncomplexity to be ``solved\", using a novel interpretation of causal\napproximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes\nof operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal\nhomotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a\ncollection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous\" causal mechanism\nthat assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous\nvariables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this\npaper, every causal diagram has a ``solution\" in the form of a (co)limit: this\nimplies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated\" by some global\nfunction with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.\nNatural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.\nIn addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject\nclassifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.\nExponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal\nequivalences and interventions.

By leveraging the\nassociations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial\nrepresentation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.\ntexture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate\nmolecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs\nAdaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by\ndynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.\nExperimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.

To overcome\nthe communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,\ndecentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)\ncommunication, has been extensively explored in the research community.\nAlthough researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model\nconvergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost\nalong with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These\ncosts are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each\ntraining round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.\nFurthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments\naffects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity\ndegrades model performance.

Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a\ndirect one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon\ncontrols, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,\nvisual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and\ninaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface\nelectromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to\ncapture hand motion.

Semi-supervised\ndomain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,\nassuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but\nthe test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,\nMoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are\nhighly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts\nresulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,\ndomain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a\ndomain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.\nSubsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive\ncontrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final\nclassifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and\ndiscriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data\naugmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow\nbetween the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex\nrepresentations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA\nachieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various\nunlabeled ratios in the target domain data.

We demonstrate\nthat attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements\nof classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional\nstimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that\ncontain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention\noperation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where\nCS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our\nframework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized\nmodel: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store\nO($\\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an\nerror propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of\nbalancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and\n(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance\ntransformer architectures.

However, building a unified\nspeech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges:\n(1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens,\nextending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data\nfor fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information\nat different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features,\nwhile understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to\ndifficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these\nchallenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization\nand speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an\nUnderstanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level\nsemantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text\nLLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which\nreduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech\nLLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that\nconcurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a\nunified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and\ngeneration capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision\nloss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and\nenhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between\nunderstanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of\nmutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u6807\u8bb0\uff08USTokenizer\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u6807\u8bb0\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff08DualSpeechLM\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u80fd\u529b\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUSTokenizer\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1DualSpeechLM\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u548cCoC\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "USTokenizer\u548cDualSpeechLM\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u97f3\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Moreover, estimates of\nthe HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant\nconditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the\nencoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop\naugmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a\npredefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically\nconsistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned\nposterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for\ninterpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based\nmaterial matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material\nmatches for an inferred emissivity distribution.

A\nlarge dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an\nexperimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple\nradionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,\nthe statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning\napproaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics.

These problems reduce their ability to generalize in\nreal-world conversations. To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a\nLightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal\nERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention\n(LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with\nparallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and\nbetween-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature\nlearning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and\ncombines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way.

This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR\n(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a\nphoto-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS\nmodel, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS\nmodel may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this\nend, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which\njointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or\nnot) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across\ndifferent frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO\nproblem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm\nthat reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional\nbranch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are\npresented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method\nachieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and\nlegged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios.

However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,\nwhere node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature\nprojection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this\nissue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our\nexploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to\nhandle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at\npreserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects\nfine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and\ncross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical\nglobal-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network\n(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical\nfeature projection and fusion.

It learns\nto dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers\nand a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing\nhigh-quality, multi-level features.

First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder\nframework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse\nvision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision\ntransformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT).

While existing methods can generate visually compelling\nvideos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground\nsubject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework\nthat explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and\naction from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these\nelements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the\npossibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything\nanywhere.

Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical\nautoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into\nopen-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the\nVDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive\nvideo generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from\ndifferent domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to\nblend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to\nuser prompts.

A systematic analysis of recent studies employing diverse LoRA\nvariants, synthetic data generation, user feedback integration, and adaptive\nparameter allocation was conducted to assess their impact on computational\nefficiency, retrieval precision, linguistic authenticity, and scalability.\nFindings reveal that dynamic and ensemble LoRA adaptations significantly reduce\ntrainable parameters without sacrificing retrieval accuracy and generation\nquality in dialectal contexts. However, limitations remain in fully preserving\nfine-grained linguistic nuances, especially for low-resource settings like\nCantonese. The integration of real-time user feedback and domain-specific data\nremains underdeveloped, limiting model adaptability and personalization. While\nselective parameter freezing and nonlinear adaptation methods offer better\ntrade-offs between efficiency and accuracy, their robustness at scale remains\nan open challenge.

These features make\nInternBootcamp fundamental infrastructure for RL-based model optimization,\nsynthetic data generation, and model evaluation. Although manually developing\nsuch a framework with enormous task coverage is extremely cumbersome, we\naccelerate the development procedure through an automated agent workflow\nsupplemented by manual validation protocols, which enables the task scope to\nexpand rapidly. % With these bootcamps, we further establish Bootcamp-EVAL, an\nautomatically generated benchmark for comprehensive performance assessment.\nEvaluation reveals that frontier models still underperform in many reasoning\ntasks, while training with InternBootcamp provides an effective way to\nsignificantly improve performance, leading to our 32B model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on Bootcamp-EVAL and excels on other established\nbenchmarks.

To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt.

As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that\nintegrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared\nmanifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents\nthat can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to\nuser-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four\ninterconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,\n(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)\nSpatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and\n(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an\nimplementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target\napplication and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our\nframework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future\nresearch toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively\nbridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684AR\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAR\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5904\u7406\uff09\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b58\u50a8\uff09\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7efc\u5408\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u548c\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u5757\uff08AR\u901a\u4fe1\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3001\u672a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u7684AR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8f85\u52a9\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u3002"}}

This paper together with its implementation serves\nas a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&P problems by providing a\nsolid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further\nimproved upon.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5207\u5272\u4e0e\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ce\uff08CDE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5207\u5272\u4e0e\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6311\u6218\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f15\u64ce\uff08CDE\uff09\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u51e0\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0jagua-rs\u3002", "result": "CDE\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u5207\u5272\u4e0e\u5305\u88c5\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs.

To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases.

In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts.

However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,\nrendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute\ngenerated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus\nundermining privacy leakage accountability\n  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership\nAudit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content\nin a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the\nenvironmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an\nattribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which\nrobustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through\nlarge-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,\nSMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs\ninto textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the\ntext modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on\nimage retrieval traces in MRAG systems.

The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

By re-examining the outputs of autoregressive models, we observed\nthat some segments exhibit parallelizable structures, which we term intrinsic\nparallelism. Decoding each parallelizable branch simultaneously (i.e. parallel\ndecoding) can significantly improve the overall inference speed of LLMs. In\nthis paper, we propose an Adaptive Serial-Parallel Decoding (ASPD), which\naddresses two core challenges: automated construction of parallelizable data\nand efficient parallel decoding mechanism. More specifically, we introduce a\nnon-invasive pipeline that automatically extracts and validates parallelizable\nstructures from the responses of autoregressive models. To empower efficient\nadaptive serial-parallel decoding, we implement a Hybrid Decoding Engine which\nenables seamless transitions between serial and parallel decoding modes while\nmaintaining a reusable KV cache, maximizing computational efficiency. Extensive\nevaluations across General Tasks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Mathematical\nReasoning, demonstrate that ASPD achieves unprecedented performance in both\neffectiveness and efficiency.

In this work, we present a scalable\ntraining pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised\nfine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we\npretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both\nModern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the\nsubsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture\nof filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset.\nOur approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the\nmulti-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge.

While\ntraditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from\nbi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for\naccurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change\ninformation by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question\nAnswering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have\nbeen developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share\nsimilar distributions.

It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or\nhow the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's\ncharacteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,\nstructurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard\naccuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42\ntopological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph\nneural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input\nnetworks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform\nwell on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random\nforest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with\ngraph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends\nstrongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle\ndensity, and degree assortativity.

While\nnumerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation\nabilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they\noften rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to\nscale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second,\nmost existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual\nbenchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To\naddress these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for\ngenerating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual\nannotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases\nby generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a\nmultilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order\nproblem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we\nintroduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising\n3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is\nspecifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical\nmultilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary\nLLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The\nresults show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity,\ndiversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce\nAutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models to assess their\nfew-shot code generation capabilities.

The goal is to investigate whether SLMs can match\nthe performance of LLMs on certain types of programming problems while\nproducing more energy-efficient code. We evaluate 150 coding problems from\nLeetCode, evenly distributed across three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and\nhard. Our comparison includes three small open-source models, StableCode-3B,\nStarCoderBase-3B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct, and two large commercial\nmodels, GPT-4.0 and DeepSeek-Reasoner.

While the framework is rooted in Machine\nEthics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by\noutlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action\nunder time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is\nnot constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive\ndeliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled\nmanner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the\nconceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a\nmoral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support\nreal-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative\nreasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to\nenable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the\ndual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through\ntop-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh\ncompeting considerations in context while integrating culturally specific\nnormative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold.

The proposed adaptive personalized conversational\ninformation retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.\nThe results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5APCIR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u67e5\u8be2\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u5bf9\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "APCIR\u9996\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u67e5\u8be2\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728TREC iKAT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAPCIR\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5APCIR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.

However, despite the widespread use of RDBs\nacross various fields, the inherent structure of relational databases hinders\ntheir ability to benefit from flourishing deep learning methods. Previous\nresearch has primarily focused on exploiting the unary dependency among\nmultiple tables in a relational database using the primary key - foreign key\nrelationships, either joining multiple tables into a single table or\nconstructing a graph among them, which leaves the implicit composite relations\namong different tables and a substantial potential of improvement for\npredictive modeling unexplored. In this paper, we propose SRP, a unified\npredictive modeling framework that synthesizes features using the unary\ndependency, retrieves related information to capture the composite dependency,\nand propagates messages across a constructed graph to learn adjacent patterns\nfor prediction on relation databases. By introducing a new retrieval mechanism\ninto RDB, SRP is designed to fully capture both the unary and the composite\ndependencies within a relational database, thereby enhancing the receptive\nfield of tabular data prediction.

However, too many tokens\ngenerated in decoding phase, i.e., occupying the resources for a long time,\nessentially hamper the cloud from achieving a higher throughput. Meanwhile, due\nto limited on-device resources, the time to first token (TTFT), i.e., the\nlatency of prefill phase, increases dramatically with the growth on prompt\nlength. In order to concur with such a bottleneck on resources, i.e., long\noccupation in cloud and limited on-device computing capacity, we propose to\nseparate large language model between cloud and devices. That is, the cloud\nhelps a portion of the content for each device, only in its prefill phase.\nSpecifically, after receiving the first token from the cloud, decoupling with\nits own prefill, the device responds to the user immediately for a lower TTFT.\nThen, the following tokens from cloud are presented via a speed controller for\nsmoothed TPOT (the time per output token), until the device catches up with the\nprogress. On-device prefill is then amortized using received tokens while the\nresource usage in cloud is controlled.

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions.

However, existing methods\noften rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making\nit difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures\ntypically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This\nprocess heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by\nhigh costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to\nsupport multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of\nprocessing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing\nend-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete\nspectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to\nuncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across\nspectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation.

However, most existing methods rely on centralized training with\nuniformly collected data, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous mobile\nenvironments with non-IID data distributions. This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive benchmarking of federated learning (FL) strategies for throughput\nprediction in realistic 5G edge scenarios. We evaluate three aggregation\nalgorithms - FedAvg, FedProx, and FedBN - across four time-series\narchitectures: LSTM, CNN, CNN+LSTM, and Transformer, using five diverse\nreal-world datasets. We systematically analyze the effects of client\nheterogeneity, cohort size, and history window length on prediction\nperformance. Our results reveal key trade-offs among model complexities,\nconvergence rates, and generalization. It is found that FedBN consistently\ndelivers robust performance under non-IID conditions. On the other hand, LSTM\nand Transformer models outperform CNN-based baselines by up to 80% in R2\nscores. Moreover, although Transformers converge in half the rounds of LSTM,\nthey require longer history windows to achieve a high R2, indicating higher\ncontext dependence. LSTM is, therefore, found to achieve a favorable balance\nbetween accuracy, rounds, and temporal footprint. To validate the end-to-end\napplicability of the framework, we have integrated our FL-based predictors into\na live adaptive streaming pipeline. It is seen that FedBN-based LSTM and\nTransformer models improve mean QoE scores by 11.7% and 11.4%, respectively,\nover FedAvg, while also reducing the variance.

Consequently, a larger policy must contain more\ntrainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space.\nAny increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as\nincreasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with\nconvergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a\nmeaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state\ninto a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this\nmatrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the\nhighest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE\nwith CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input\nstate, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple\nreinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result\nthrough reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a\nbilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by\nthe CMA-ES algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "SCOPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u4f59\u5f26\u53d8\u6362\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u8fdb\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728Atari\u6e38\u620fSpace Invaders\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e38\u620f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u53c2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6269\u5927\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "SCOPE\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u4f59\u5f26\u53d8\u6362\uff08DCT\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7cfb\u6570\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Space Invaders\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSCOPE\u7ed3\u5408CMA-ES\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1153%\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8eOpenAI-ES\u3001HyperNEAT\u3001DQN\u548cA3C\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The\nhybrid technology of these two ingredients is expected to be a powerful tool to\nsolve complex problems in many branches of science and engineering such as\ncombinatorial optimization problems and accelerate the creation of\nnext-generation technologies. In this work, we develop an algorithm to solve a\nblack-box optimization problem by improving Factorization Machine Annealing\n(FMA) such that the training of a machine learning model called Factorization\nMachine is performed not by a full dataset but by a subdataset which is sampled\nfrom a full dataset: Subsampling Factorization Machine Annealing (SFMA).\nAccording to such a probabilistic training process, the performance of FMA on\nexploring a solution space gets enhanced. As a result, SFMA exhibits balanced\nperformance of exploration and exploitation which we call\nexploitation-exploration functionality. We conduct numerical benchmarking tests\nto compare the performance of SFMA with that of FMA. Consequently, SFMA\ncertainly exhibits the exploration-exploitation functionality and outperforms\nFMA in speed and accuracy.

To mitigate these challenges, the\nimplementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough\nprocess of anomaly identification and detection in information and\ncommunication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and\nreliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within\ndigital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity\nchallenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart\ngrids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic\nobject-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and\nintroduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the\nlimitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting\nthreats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging\ngenerative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs.

Conventional outdoor monitoring\nrelies on static multimodal deep learning frameworks, which requires extensive\ndata training from scratch and fails to capture subtle health status changes.\nMultimodal large language models (MLLMs) emerge as a promising alternative,\nutilizing only small datasets to fine-tune pre-trained information-rich models\nfor enabling powerful health status monitoring. Unfortunately, MLLM-based\noutdoor health monitoring also faces significant challenges: I) sensor data\ncontains input noise stemming from sensor data acquisition and fluctuation\nnoise caused by sudden changes in physiological signals due to dynamic outdoor\nenvironments, thus degrading the training performance; ii) current transformer\nbased MLLMs struggle to achieve robust multimodal fusion, as they lack a design\nfor fusing the noisy modality; iii) modalities with varying noise levels hinder\naccurate recovery of missing data from fluctuating distributions. To combat\nthese challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware multimodal fusion framework,\nnamed DUAL-Health, for outdoor health monitoring in dynamic and noisy\nenvironments. First, to assess the impact of noise, we accurately quantify\nmodality uncertainty caused by input and fluctuation noise with current and\ntemporal features. Second, to empower efficient muitimodal fusion with\nlow-quality modalities,we customize the fusion weight for each modality based\non quantified and calibrated uncertainty.

Besides\nit addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for\nexample, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by\njointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown\nprecoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet\nfollowed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive\n(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet\nchannel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded\nPRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel\nspatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet\nsignificantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a\nwide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB\ngain at high SNRs.

Recently,\nembedding fingerprints into LLMs has emerged as a prevalent method for\nestablishing model ownership. However, existing back-door-based methods suffer\nfrom limited stealth and efficiency. To simultaneously address these issues, we\npropose EditMF, a training-free fingerprinting paradigm that achieves highly\nimperceptible fingerprint embedding with minimal computational overhead.\nOwnership bits are mapped to compact, semantically coherent triples drawn from\nan encrypted artificial knowledge base (e.g., virtual author-novel-protagonist\nfacts). Causal tracing localizes the minimal set of layers influencing each\ntriple, and a zero-space update injects the fingerprint without perturbing\nunrelated knowledge.

To tackle the challenges of this broad scenario, we\npropose a framework that integrates media data collection, user profile\ncreation, and cognitive architecture for opinion updates to successfully\nreproduce the real trend of US attitudes towards China over a 20-year period\nfrom 2005 to today. We also leverage LLMs' capabilities to introduce debiased\nmedia exposure, extracting neutral events from typically subjective news\ncontents, to uncover the roots of polarized opinion formation, as well as a\ndevils advocate agent to help explain the rare reversal from negative to\npositive attitudes towards China, corresponding with changes in the way\nAmericans obtain information about the country. The simulation results, beyond\nvalidating our framework architecture, also reveal the impact of biased framing\nand selection bias in shaping attitudes. Overall, our work contributes to a new\nparadigm for LLM-based modeling of cognitive behaviors in a large-scale,\nlong-term, cross-border social context, providing insights into the formation\nof international biases and offering valuable implications for media consumers\nto better understand the factors shaping their perspectives, and ultimately\ncontributing to the larger social need for bias reduction and cross-cultural\ntolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5efa\u6a21\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8de8\u56fd\u6001\u5ea6\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u7f8e\u56fd\u516c\u6c11\u5bf9\u4e2d\u56fd\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6001\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5a92\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u5bf9\u89c2\u70b9\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5229\u7528LLMs\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u8de8\u56fd\u6001\u5ea6\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u957f\u671f\u3001\u8de8\u56fd\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6574\u5408\u5a92\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u3001\u7528\u6237\u6863\u6848\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5b9e\u73b0\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5a92\u4f53\u66dd\u5149\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u9b54\u9b3c\u4ee3\u8a00\u4eba\u201d\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u6001\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u6210\u529f\u518d\u73b0\u4e862005\u5e74\u81f3\u4eca\u7f8e\u56fd\u5bf9\u534e\u6001\u5ea6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5a92\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u5bf9\u6001\u5ea6\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u957f\u671f\u3001\u8de8\u56fd\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8de8\u6587\u5316\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Such interactions have been more effectively\ncaptured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and\ncalibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for\nPredicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict\nboth the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block\nlevel under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.\nGuided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal\nattention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory\nguides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation\ndynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention\nmodule for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a\nregularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs\nsignificantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial\nland use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%\nimprovement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided\nmodules was further validated through ablation studies.

Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption\npreferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,\nmainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and\ndiscovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive\nRetrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the\nframework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to\nconstruct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the\nRQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining\nbehavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve\ndynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the\nprobability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.\nThis facilitates an efficient \"soft-search\" strategy during online inference,\nrevolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from \"passive matching\" to \"proactive\nexploration\" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B\ntests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have\nachieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view\nduration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in\nPV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are\nconducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and\nNormalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent\nimprovement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and\npractical value of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSPARC\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u79bb\u6563\u5174\u8da3\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6982\u7387\u5174\u8da3\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u5174\u8da3\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5174\u8da3\u9759\u6001\u5316\u548c\u88ab\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u65f6\u504f\u597d\u6216\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u5174\u8da3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528RQ-VAE\u6784\u5efa\u79bb\u6563\u5174\u8da3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6982\u7387\u5174\u8da3\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u7528\u6237\u89c2\u770b\u65f6\u957f\u589e\u52a00.9%\uff0c\u9875\u9762\u6d4f\u89c8\u91cf\u589e\u52a00.4%\uff0cPV500\u63d0\u534722.7%\uff1b\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728Recall@K\u548cNDCG@K\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SPARC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5174\u8da3\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel harmony-aware GAN framework,\nfollowing a specifically designed harmony evaluation strategy to enhance\nrhythmic synchronization in the automatic music-to-motion synthesis using a UGC\ndance dataset. This harmony strategy utilizes refined cross-modal beat\ndetection to capture closely correlated audio and visual rhythms in an\naudio-visual pair. To mimic human attention mechanism, we introduce\nsaliency-based beat weighting and interval-driven beat alignment, which ensures\naccurate harmony score estimation consistent with human perception. Building on\nthis strategy, our model, employing efficient encoder-decoder and depth-lifting\ndesigns, is adversarially trained based on categorized musical meter segments\nto generate realistic and rhythmic 3D human motions. We further incorporate our\nharmony evaluation strategy as a weakly supervised perceptual constraint to\nflexibly guide the synchronized audio-visual rhythms during the generation\nprocess. Experimental results show that our proposed model significantly\noutperforms other leading music-to-motion methods in rhythmic harmony, both\nquantitatively and qualitatively, even with limited UGC training data.

The system is pre-trained\non 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a\nspecialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751\nsubjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and\ncontactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without\nrequiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it\ngenerates natural language risk reports and individualized health\nrecommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow\nsupports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.", "AI": {"tldr": "DigitalShadow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684CAD\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u53e3\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0cCAD\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6b7b\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec32100\u4e07\u5f20\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3aLiveCAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u75287004\u5f20\u6765\u81ea1751\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884cCAD\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "DigitalShadow\u80fd\u88ab\u52a8\u3001\u65e0\u63a5\u89e6\u5730\u5206\u6790\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u9669\u62a5\u544a\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u9690\u79c1\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3aCAD\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive\nlearning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that\naligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects.

In a\ntwo-factorial within-subject study with 74 participants, we analyzed 13 videos\nsimulating MR experiences during a city walk. Results show that all dark\npatterns significantly reduced user comfort, increased reactance, and decreased\nthe intention to use MR glasses, with the most disruptive effects linked to\npersonal or monetary manipulation. Additionally, the dark patterns of Emotional\nand Sensory Manipulation and Hiding Information produced similar impacts on the\nuser in MR, suggesting a re-evaluation of current classifications to go beyond\ndeceptive design techniques.

Traditional on-board\nperception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots,\nwhile cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them\nunsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in\ndynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative\nframework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that\nleverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time,\nmulti-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key\nalgorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and\nVariable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data\nfrom multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where\nindividual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting\nmechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data\nfrom multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in\nreal-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We\ndevelop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped\nrobotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of\nimproved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional\nsingle-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency,\nedge-driven real-time processing.

This paper introduces\n$\\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that\nleverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and\ndiffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model\nthat combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of\nlanguage models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short\nto long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained.

We validate\nour end-to-end system using four distinct human hand gestures - left-to-right,\nright-to-left, bottom-to-top, and top-to-bottom movements - to assess energy\nefficiency and classification robustness. Our experiments show that the system\nrequires an average of only 4.17 nJ for taking our processed analog signal and\nmapping weights onto our memristive system and 0.952 nJ for testing per\nmovement class, achieving 97.22% accuracy even under 5% noise interference.

Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of\ndiffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by\niteratively denoising masked segments.

However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency.\nTraditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are\nincompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To\naddress this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that\ndLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where\nmost tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we\npropose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines\nlong-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature\nsimilarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations\nwithout compromising model performance.

In\norder to tailor the noise challenge, RBA-FE leverages six acoustic features\nextracted from the raw audio, capturing both spatial characteristics and\ntemporal dependencies. This hybrid attribute helps alleviate the precision\nlimitation in audio feature extraction within other learning models like deep\nresidual shrinkage networks. To deal with the noise issues, our model\nincorporates an improved spiking neuron model, called adaptive rate smooth\nleaky integrate-and-fire (ARSLIF). The ARSLIF model emulates the mechanism of\n``retuning of cellular signal selectivity\" in the brain attention systems,\nwhich enhances the model robustness against environmental noises in audio data.\nExperimental results demonstrate that RBA-FE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy\non the MODMA dataset, respectively with 0.8750, 0.8974, 0.8750 and 0.8750 in\nprecision, accuracy, recall and F1 score.

Industrial environments\nthat require the inspection of specific objects or structures (called\n\"semantics\"), such as ballast water tanks inside ships, often present\nstructured and repetitive spatial arrangements of the semantics of interest.\nMotivated by this, we first contribute an algorithm that identifies spatially\nrepeating patterns of semantics - exact or inexact - in a semantic scene graph\nrepresentation and makes predictions about the evolution of the graph in the\nunseen parts of the environment using these patterns. Furthermore, two\ninspection path planning strategies, tailored to ballast water tank inspection,\nthat exploit these predictions are proposed. To assess the performance of the\nnovel predictive planning paradigm, both simulation and experimental\nevaluations are performed. First, we conduct a simulation study comparing the\nmethod against relevant state-of-the-art techniques and further present tests\nshowing its ability to handle imperfect patterns. Second, we deploy our method\nonboard a collision-tolerant aerial robot operating inside the ballast tanks of\ntwo real ships.

To address these\nchallenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of\noperational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile\nPackard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and\nderive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on\nthese inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using\nSimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a\nbaseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to\nevaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which\ndifferent proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a\nhospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2\nratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation\ngenerally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient\nvariability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply\nreinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic\nallocation policy.

Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk\nor Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and\nits role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and\nbuying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual\nin the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that\nencodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids.\nThe population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators.\nRecombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation\nis applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The\nevaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that\nconsiders the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community\nlevel, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the\ndegradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated\nscenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds,\nto reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of\nmicrogrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the\n100 microgrids reached a stable energy state.

The\ndeblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.\nWe train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,\nachieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "EV-LayerSegNet\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763CNN\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEV-LayerSegNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u4eff\u5c04\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u8d28\u91cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ec5\u542b\u4eff\u5c04\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cIoU\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523071%\u548c87%\u3002", "conclusion": "EV-LayerSegNet\u5728\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u3002"}}

This unconditional rejection of\nnon-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in\nthe whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo\nAugmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling\nnodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes\nalong each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model\nidentifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a\nrevision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring\ntrajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying\nthe underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches,\nSIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH\nbenchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K\nsamples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples.

This is because, while the\ntoken vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the\ntokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the\ncanonical tokenization.

However, the nature of model aggregation at\nthe centralized server can result in a performance drop in the presence of\nnon-IID data across different clients. We remark that training a client locally\non more data than necessary does not benefit the overall performance of all\nclients. In this paper, we devise a novel framework that leverages a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to select an optimized amount of data\nnecessary to train a client model without oversharing information with the\nserver. Starting without awareness of the client's performance, the DRL agent\nutilizes the change in training loss as a reward signal and learns to optimize\nthe amount of training data necessary for improving the client's performance.\nSpecifically, after each aggregation round, the DRL algorithm considers the\nlocal performance as the current state and outputs the optimized weights for\neach class, in the training data, to be used during the next round of local\ntraining. In doing so, the agent learns a policy that creates an optimized\npartition of the local training dataset during the FL rounds. After FL, the\nclient utilizes the entire local training dataset to further enhance its\nperformance on its own data distribution, mitigating the non-IID effects of\naggregation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that training FL\nclients through our algorithm results in superior performance on multiple\nbenchmark datasets and FL frameworks.

A key\ncomponent is a robust trajectory scorer capable of selecting the optimal\ntrajectory from these candidates.

This sequential approach creates\na mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders\nperpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose\nSelf-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an\nattacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast\nsafety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates\nbetween attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and\nsafeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This\nenables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of\nzero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the\ndesign of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the\ndefender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.\nEmpirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared\nto attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on\nsafety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained\nagainst static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing\nagents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces\nover-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive\nco-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust\nself-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).", "AI": {"tldr": "Self-RedTeam\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7684\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6ede\u540e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSelf-RedTeam\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u66ff\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSelf-RedTeam\u653b\u51fb\u591a\u6837\u6027\u63d0\u534721.8%\uff0c\u9632\u5fa1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u534765.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u85cf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u5021\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u4fee\u8865\u8f6c\u5411\u4e3b\u52a8\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b89\u5168\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Its goal is to reconstruct high-resolution images or\nvideo frames from low-resolution inputs, thereby enhancing detail preservation\nand enabling more accurate scene analysis and interpretation. In recent years,\nnumerous innovative and effective approaches have been proposed, predominantly\nbased on deep learning techniques, involving diverse network architectures,\nloss functions, projection strategies, and training datasets. This paper\npresents a systematic review of recent progress in omnidirectional image and\nvideo super-resolution, focusing on deep learning-based methods. Given that\nexisting datasets predominantly rely on synthetic degradation and fall short in\ncapturing real-world distortions, we introduce a new dataset, 360Insta, that\ncomprises authentically degraded omnidirectional images and videos collected\nunder diverse conditions, including varying lighting, motion, and exposure\nsettings. This dataset addresses a critical gap in current omnidirectional\nbenchmarks and enables more robust evaluation of the generalization\ncapabilities of omnidirectional super-resolution methods. We conduct\ncomprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of existing methods on\nboth public datasets and our proposed dataset. Furthermore, we provide a\nsystematic overview of the current status of research and discuss promising\ndirections for future exploration.

Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic\ndual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth\nHeaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion\nnear weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta\nalgorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the\nabove-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and\nHDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise\nresistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of\ninitial velocities and initial contours.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u66f2\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff08HMCF-ACMs\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\uff08HDRF-ACMs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u8c03\u521d\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u529b\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6297\u566a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6a21\u578b\uff08PMCF-ACMs\uff09\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u66f2\u7ebf\u914d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u66f2\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHMCF-ACMs\u548cHDRF-ACMs\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u8c03\u521d\u59cb\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u529b\u8c03\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u56db\u9636Runge-Kutta\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u6ce2\u52a8\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHMCF-ACMs\u548cHDRF-ACMs\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u66f2\u5e73\u5747\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8f6e\u5ed3\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Table tennis serves as an ideal testbed for\nthis problem, demanding both rapid interception of fast-moving balls and\nprecise adjustment of their trajectories. This task presents two fundamental\nchallenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately\npredicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic\nplanning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature\nof table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it\nparticularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in\nfast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present\nSpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation\nlearning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two\nkey attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a\nspike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in\nball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties\nsuch as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module\nthat enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system\nharnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,\ncombined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory\ncorrection and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target\narea and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively.

We reveal that conventional\ninference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform\npoorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like\nBest-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified\nchallenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high\ncomputational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)\nevaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference\nscaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our\napproach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that\nsignificantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To\noperationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision\ntraining objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to\nprevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value\ncaching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree\nsearch. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.\nAdditionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model\n(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)\nto accelerate future research in LLM safety.

Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the\nevolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel\nauditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to\nautomate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological\ncapabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to\ncapture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a\nshared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using\nthis framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S.\nDepartment of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain\nworkers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks\nspanning 104 occupations.

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment\nmapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional\nmodality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal\nspatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained\nmultimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these\nmaps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our\nmaps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to\naudio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When\ncombined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural\nlanguage commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., \"in between the\nsofa and TV\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across\ndifferent robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.\nBuilding upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a\nunified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues\nthrough the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.\nThis enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or\naudio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the\nincorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal\ndisambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and\nreal-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps\nenable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by\n50% in ambiguous scenarios.

Leveraging prior knowledge has the potential to\nsignificantly enhance learning efficiency, which, however, raises two critical\nchallenges: how to determine the relevancy of existing knowledge and how to\nadaptively integrate them into learning a new task. In this paper, we propose\nContext-aware Adaptation for Robot Learning (CARoL), a novel framework to\nefficiently learn a similar but distinct new task from prior knowledge. CARoL\nincorporates context awareness by analyzing state transitions in system\ndynamics to identify similarities between the new task and prior knowledge. It\nthen utilizes these identified similarities to prioritize and adapt specific\nknowledge pieces for the new task. Additionally, CARoL has a broad\napplicability spanning policy-based, value-based, and actor-critic RL\nalgorithms.

Test-time adaptation (TTA) has recently\nemerged as a viable strategy to address such domain shifts at inference time\nwithout requiring access to source data or labels. However, existing TTA\napproaches, particularly those relying on backpropagation, are\nmemory-intensive, limiting their applicability in speech tasks and\nresource-constrained settings. Although backpropagation-free methods offer\nimproved efficiency, existing ones exhibit poor accuracy. This is because they\nare predominantly developed for vision tasks, which fundamentally differ from\nspeech task formulations, noise characteristics, and model architecture, posing\nunique transferability challenges. In this paper, we introduce E-BATS, the\nfirst Efficient BAckpropagation-free TTA framework designed explicitly for\nspeech foundation models. E-BATS achieves a balance between adaptation\neffectiveness and memory efficiency through three key components: (i)\nlightweight prompt adaptation for a forward-pass-based feature alignment, (ii)\na multi-scale loss to capture both global (utterance-level) and local\ndistribution shifts (token-level) and (iii) a test-time exponential moving\naverage mechanism for stable adaptation across utterances. Experiments\nconducted on four noisy speech datasets spanning sixteen acoustic conditions\ndemonstrate consistent improvements, with 4.1%-13.5% accuracy gains over\nbackpropagation-free baselines and 2.0-6.4 times GPU memory savings compared to\nbackpropagation-based methods.

Traditional approaches\nto G-TAMP have relied either on domain-independent heuristics or on learning\nfrom planning experience to guide the search, both of which typically demand\nsignificant computational resources or data. In contrast, humans often use\ncommon sense to intuitively decide which objects to manipulate in G-TAMP\nproblems. Inspired by this, we propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),\nwhich have common sense knowledge acquired from internet-scale data, to guide\ntask planning in G-TAMP problems. To enable LLMs to perform geometric\nreasoning, we design a predicate-based prompt that encodes geometric\ninformation derived from a motion planning algorithm. We then query the LLM to\ngenerate a task plan, which is then used to search for a feasible set of\ncontinuous parameters. Since LLMs are prone to mistakes, instead of committing\nto LLM's outputs, we extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to a hybrid action\nspace and use the LLM to guide the search. Unlike the previous approach that\ncalls an LLM at every node and incurs high computational costs, we use it to\nwarm-start the MCTS with the nodes explored in completing the LLM's task plan.\nOn six different G-TAMP problems, we show our method outperforms previous LLM\nplanners and pure search algorithms.

This\nresearch introduces a fully automated approach designed to tackle these issues\nby utilizing available vehicle trajectory data alongside knowledge from the\ntransportation domain to effectively impute and rectify traffic signal\ninformation within the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). The proposed method is\nrobust and flexible, capable of handling diverse intersection geometries and\ntraffic signal configurations in real-world scenarios. Comprehensive\nvalidations have been conducted on the entire WOMD, focusing on over 360,000\nrelevant scenarios involving traffic signals, out of a total of 530,000\nreal-world driving scenarios. In the original dataset, 71.7% of traffic signal\nstates are either missing or unknown, all of which were successfully imputed by\nour proposed method. Furthermore, in the absence of ground-truth signal states,\nthe accuracy of our approach is evaluated based on the rate of red-light\nviolations among vehicle trajectories. Results show that our method reduces the\nestimated red-light running rate from 15.7% in the original data to 2.9%,\nthereby demonstrating its efficacy in rectifying data inaccuracies.

AGF approximates this behavior as an alternating two-step\nprocess: maximizing a utility function over dormant neurons and minimizing a\ncost function over active ones. AGF begins with all neurons dormant. At each\nround, a dormant neuron activates, triggering the acquisition of a feature and\na drop in the loss. AGF quantifies the order, timing, and magnitude of these\ndrops, matching experiments across architectures. We show that AGF unifies and\nextends existing saddle-to-saddle analyses in fully connected linear networks\nand attention-only linear transformers, where the learned features are singular\nmodes and principal components, respectively. In diagonal linear networks, we\nprove AGF converges to gradient flow in the limit of vanishing initialization.\nApplying AGF to quadratic networks trained to perform modular addition, we give\nthe first complete characterization of the training dynamics, revealing that\nnetworks learn Fourier features in decreasing order of coefficient magnitude.\nAltogether, AGF offers a promising step towards understanding feature learning\nin neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u66ff\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\uff08AGF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5c0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0b\u4e24\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7AGF\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e00\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "AGF\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u884c\u4e3a\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4ea4\u66ff\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u4f11\u7720\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6d3b\u8dc3\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "AGF\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AGF\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Although quadrotors have seen widespread adoption in applications such\nas cinematography, agriculture, and disaster management with increasingly\nsophisticated control systems, their hardware configurations have remained\nlargely unchanged, limiting their capabilities in certain environments. Our\ndesign addresses this by enabling the hardware configuration to change on the\nfly when required. In standard flight mode, the MorphoCopter adopts an X\nconfiguration, functioning as a traditional quadcopter, but can quickly fold\ninto a stacked bicopters arrangement or any configuration in between. Existing\nmorphing designs often sacrifice controllability in compact configurations or\nrely on complex multi-joint systems. Moreover, our design achieves a greater\nwidth reduction than any existing solution. We develop a new inertia and\ncontrol-action aware adaptive control system that maintains robust performance\nacross all rotary-joint configurations. The prototype can reduce its width from\n447 mm to 138 mm (nearly 70\\% reduction) in just a few seconds.

RetNet has garnered\nsignificant research interest due to its consistently demonstrated cross-domain\neffectiveness, achieving robust performance across machine learning paradigms\nincluding natural language processing, speech recognition, and time-series\nanalysis.

In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such\nas going quickly from A to B.

We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it\nreaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility.

In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs\nby tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial\ndialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ\nrepetitive strategies, leading to low success rates.

The primary challenge\narises from learning the distribution of indoor semantics, complicated by\nsparse, imbalanced object categories and diverse spatial scales. Existing\nmethods struggle to robustly generate unobserved areas in real time and do not\ngeneralize well to new environments. To this end, we propose \\textbf{MapBERT},\na novel framework designed to effectively model the distribution of unseen\nspaces. Motivated by the observation that the one-hot encoding of semantic maps\naligns naturally with the binary structure of bit encoding, we, for the first\ntime, leverage a lookup-free BitVAE to encode semantic maps into compact\nbitwise tokens.

To achieve it, we propose the RAPID Hand, a\nco-optimized hardware and software platform where the compact 20-DoF hand,\nrobust whole-hand perception, and high-DoF teleoperation interface are jointly\ndesigned. Specifically, RAPID Hand adopts a compact and practical hand ontology\nand a hardware-level perception framework that stably integrates wrist-mounted\nvision, fingertip tactile sensing, and proprioception with sub-7 ms latency and\nspatial alignment. Collecting high-quality demonstrations on high-DoF hands is\nchallenging, as existing teleoperation methods struggle with precision and\nstability on complex multi-fingered systems.

Recent\nmodels trained on NSD have been evaluated only on seen image reconstruction.\nUsing NSD-Imagery, it is possible to assess how well these models perform on\nmental image reconstruction.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge\nto the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the\nsemantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing\ndefense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface\ngeometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores\nperturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples\nfrom the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally\nefficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and\npractical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset\ndemonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various\nattack types.

Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from\nenforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the\nGemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on\nstandard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN\nneurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This\nsparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time\nspeedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "Spark Transformer\u901a\u8fc7top-k\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1top-k\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u4e2dReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528top-k\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1top-k\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6761\u76ee\u3002", "result": "Spark Transformer\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0cFFN\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7387\u4ec58%\uff0cFLOPs\u51cf\u5c112.5\u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.79x\uff08CPU\uff09\u548c1.40x\uff08GPU\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Spark Transformer\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e14\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recently, foundation\nmodels have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks\nby capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us\nto ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables\ngeneralizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new\nheterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant\ndifferences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly\nshare common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective.\nTherefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining\nshared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise\nheterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation\nsurrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared\nrelation-aware attack units.

However, only few methods incorporate 3D\nsignals into VLMs for action prediction, and they do not fully leverage the\nspatial structure inherent in 3D data, leading to low sample efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce BridgeVLA, a novel 3D VLA model that (1) projects 3D\ninputs to multiple 2D images, ensuring input alignment with the VLM backbone,\nand (2) utilizes 2D heatmaps for action prediction, unifying the input and\noutput spaces within a consistent 2D image space. In addition, we propose a\nscalable pre-training method that equips the VLM backbone with the capability\nto predict 2D heatmaps before downstream policy learning. Extensive experiments\nshow the proposed method is able to learn 3D manipulation efficiently and\neffectively. BridgeVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods across\nthree simulation benchmarks. In RLBench, it improves the average success rate\nfrom 81.4% to 88.2%. In COLOSSEUM, it demonstrates significantly better\nperformance in challenging generalization settings, boosting the average\nsuccess rate from 56.7% to 64.0%. In GemBench, it surpasses all the comparing\nbaseline methods in terms of average success rate. In real-robot experiments,\nBridgeVLA outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline method by 32% on average. It\ngeneralizes robustly in multiple out-of-distribution settings, including visual\ndisturbances and unseen instructions. Remarkably, it is able to achieve a\nsuccess rate of 96.8% on 10+ tasks with only 3 trajectories per task,\nhighlighting its extraordinary sample efficiency.

To bridge this gap, we\npropose MoveGCL, a scalable and privacy-preserving framework for training\nmobility foundation models via generative continual learning.

However, in practice, the decay rate\nis often unavailable, making it non-trivial to use model-free CBFs, as it\nrequires manual tuning for alpha.

However, most existing methods typically train\nagents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static\ndifficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments\nand often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum\nlearning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL\nthat employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism.

Previous research on automatic metaphor processing\npredominantly relies on training data consisting of English samples, which\noften reflect Western European or North American biases. This cultural skew can\nlead to an overestimation of model performance and contributions to NLP\nprogress. However, the impact of cultural bias on metaphor processing,\nparticularly in multimodal contexts, remains largely unexplored. To address\nthis gap, we introduce MultiMM, a Multicultural Multimodal Metaphor dataset\ndesigned for cross-cultural studies of metaphor in Chinese and English. MultiMM\nconsists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by\nfine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal\nmetaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose\nSentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates\nsentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural\nbackgrounds. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of SEMD on\nmetaphor detection and sentiment analysis tasks.

However, navigating instruments--catheters and\nendoscopes--through anatomical pathways creates frictional interactions with\nluminal walls, risking complications such as perforation, poor haptic feedback,\nand instrument buckling. In this paper, we present a new approach to actively\nlubricate transluminal instruments and dynamically reduce friction with\nsurrounding tissues. This approach employs ultrasonic vibrations, at the\ninstrument surface, to generate a pressurized fluid layer at the contact\ninterface, lubricating the interface and thereby reducing friction. We\nimplemented this approach in a prototype catheter, which we validated under dry\nand liquid-lubricated conditions, across rigid and soft interfaces, and along\nvaried anatomical curvatures. In a cardiac catheter use case, active\nlubrication reduced friction by up to 42% on ex-vivo porcine aorta tissue and\n82% on rigid substrates, denoting its potential performance on healthy and\ncalcified tissue, respectively. Thermal imaging confirmed that temperature at\nthe tissue-catheter interface remained within safe limits. Additionally, the\nsystem effectively prevented buckling during catheter insertion experiment,\nfurther showcasing its potential. By minimizing injury risk and enhancing\nprocedural stability, active lubrication can drastically enhance the safety and\nefficacy of transluminal interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u632f\u52a8\u4e3b\u52a8\u6da6\u6ed1\u5bfc\u7ba1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6469\u64e6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u5bfc\u7ba1\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6469\u64e6\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7f\u5b54\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u632f\u52a8\u5728\u5bfc\u7ba1\u8868\u9762\u4ea7\u751f\u52a0\u538b\u6d41\u4f53\u5c42\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u51cf\u5c11\u6469\u64e6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u732a\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0a\u6469\u64e6\u51cf\u5c1142%\uff0c\u521a\u6027\u57fa\u5e95\u4e0a\u51cf\u5c1182%\uff0c\u4e14\u6e29\u5ea6\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5bfc\u7ba1\u5f2f\u66f2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u6da6\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

However, the increasing\ncomplexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural\nheterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant\nchallenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose\nFuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract\nmulti-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural\nheterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further\nintroduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate\ndistributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,\nFuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across\nlayers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for\ncomprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level\nanalysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance\nprediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while\nreducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about\n32.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuncGNN\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u95e8\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3AIGs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u7535\u8def\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u96c6\u6210\u7535\u8def\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cAIGs\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7535\u8def\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FuncGNN\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u611f\u77e5\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u7535\u8def\u95e8\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c42\u96c6\u6210\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u7efc\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u771f\u503c\u8868\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cFuncGNN\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e862.06%\u548c18.71%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8650.6%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c32.8%\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "FuncGNN\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u548c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7535\u8def\u7684\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their\nefficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective\nstrategies for stitching useful state transitions across different\ntrajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that\nformulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an\nexplicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance\nRepresentation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from\ndifferent trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition\nstitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal\nsequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the\nsubgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE)\nmetric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly\nenhancing task performance.

In contrast,\nneural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a\nscalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world\ndriving scenes.

This paper\nintroduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome\nthese limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into\nexisting scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and\nconsistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel\ndataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an\nimage-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into\nneural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic\nintegration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2\nsignificantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like\ntext-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing\nfor true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable\nand realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see\nhttps://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faR3D2\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e3D\u8d44\u4ea7\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u5e73\u53f0\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "R3D2\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\uff08\u5982\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u5149\u7167\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea3D\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d82\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u653e\u7f6e\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cR3D2\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u52303D\u8d44\u4ea7\u63d2\u5165\u548c\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u8c61\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "R3D2\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u903c\u771f\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite concerns about overfitting, these models frequently generalize\nwell to unseen data, thanks to effective regularization techniques, with data\naugmentation being among the most widely used. While data augmentation has\nshown great success in classification tasks using label-preserving\ntransformations, its application in regression problems has received less\nattention. Recently, a novel \\emph{manifold learning} approach for generating\nsynthetic data was proposed, utilizing a first-order approximation of the data\nmanifold.

In the\nsecond part, we propose DP-IHT-L, which further improves the error bound under\nadditional assumptions on the response and achieves \\(\n  \\tilde{O}\\Bigl(\\frac{(s^*)^{3/2} \\log d}{n \\varepsilon}\\Bigr). \\) Compared to\nthe first result, this bound is independent of the tail parameter $\\zeta$.\nFinally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we\ndemonstrate that our methods outperform standard DP algorithms designed for\n``regular'' data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08DP\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5DP-IHT-H\u548cDP-IHT-L\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u91cd\u5c3e\u54cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u548c\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DP\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u89c4\u5219\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u4f4e\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDP-IHT-H\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eHuber\u635f\u5931\u548c\u79c1\u6709\u8fed\u4ee3\u786c\u9608\u503c\uff09\u548cDP-IHT-L\uff08\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "DP-IHT-H\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0cDP-IHT-L\u5728\u989d\u5916\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6DP\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u91cd\u5c3e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3aDP\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Estimating\n6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's\nappearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose\nUA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online\nobject completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume\naccess to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a\nsingle 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model\nbased on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use\nimage-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method\nintegrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between\nseen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose\nestimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object\ncompletion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving\nobject completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and\nHO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots\nand human hands.

These scenarios face significant challenges due to high variance and\npoor performance with low-quality propensity scores and heavy-tailed reward\ndistributions. We address these issues by introducing a novel estimator based\non the log-sum-exponential (LSE) operator, which outperforms traditional\ninverse propensity score estimators. Our LSE estimator demonstrates variance\nreduction and robustness under heavy-tailed conditions. For off-policy\nevaluation, we derive upper bounds on the estimator's bias and variance. In the\noff-policy learning scenario, we establish bounds on the regret -- the\nperformance gap between our LSE estimator and the optimal policy -- assuming\nbounded $(1+\\epsilon)$-th moment of weighted reward.

This disparity between prior and updated\nenvironmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous\ndecision-making.

However, translating their nuanced, and\ncontext-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains\nan open challenge.

This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex\ntasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each\nfocused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions.

However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess.

We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes.

As part of these advancements,\nthere is a growing demand for more accessible and controllable forms of video\nediting, such as prompt-based editing. Previous studies have primarily focused\non tasks such as style transfer, background replacement, object substitution,\nand attribute modification, while maintaining the content structure of the\nsource video. However, more complex tasks, including the addition of novel\nobjects and nonrigid transformations, remain relatively unexplored. In this\npaper, we present TV-LiVE, a Training-free and text-guided Video editing\nframework via Layerinformed Vitality Exploitation. We empirically identify\nvital layers within the video generation model that significantly influence the\nquality of generated outputs. Notably, these layers are closely associated with\nRotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). Based on this observation, our method\nenables both object addition and non-rigid video editing by selectively\ninjecting key and value features from the source model into the corresponding\nlayers of the target model guided by the layer vitality. For object addition,\nwe further identify prominent layers to extract the mask regions corresponding\nto the newly added target prompt. We found that the extracted masks from the\nprominent layers faithfully indicate the region to be edited. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TV-LiVE outperforms existing approaches for both\nobject addition and non-rigid video editing.

Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than\nirrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal\nsimilarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods\nhave shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on\nthe construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video\nrepresentations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard\nnegative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic\nsimilarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive\nlearning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust\ndiscriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module\n(DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further\nintroducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively\nidentify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the\ntraining loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model\nfine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby\npresent a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to\nconstruct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating\nfine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL\ndesigns an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to\nmodel subtle semantic differences.

However,\ntheir knowledge is inherently limited by the scope of their pre-training data,\nwhile real-world information evolves continuously. Updating this knowledge\ntypically requires costly and brittle re-training, or in-context learning\n(ICL), which becomes impractical at scale given the volume and volatility of\nmodern information. Motivated by these limitations, we investigate how LLMs\nperform when exposed to temporal text corpora, or documents that reflect\nevolving knowledge over time, such as sports biographies where facts like a\nplayer's \"current team\" change year by year. To this end, we introduce two new\nbenchmarks: Temporal Wiki, which captures factual drift across historical\nWikipedia snapshots, and Unified Clark, which aggregates timestamped news\narticles to simulate real-world information accumulation.

However, there are concerns about the\nreliability of performance metrics and the reproducibility of many of the\nexisting methods. For instance, some previous studies seem to have a data\nleakage issue among training and test datasets, and many do not openly provide\nthe datasets they used. To this end, this paper aims to compare the performance\nof representative vehicle dynamics-based DDD methods under a transparent and\nfair framework that uses a public dataset. We first develop a framework for\nextracting features from an open dataset by Aygun et al. and performing DDD\nwith lightweight ML models; the framework is carefully designed to support a\nvariety of onfigurations. Second, we implement three existing representative\nmethods and a concise random forest (RF)-based method in the framework.\nFinally, we report the results of experiments to verify the reproducibility and\nclarify the performance of DDD based on common metrics. Among the evaluated\nmethods, the RF-based method achieved the highest accuracy of 88 %.

In the realm of tabular imbalanced applications, data imbalance\nhas been investigated in classification tasks with insufficient instances in\ncertain labels, causing the model's ineffective generalizability.

To address these issues, we propose MATI:\nMixture Experts with Test-Time Self-Supervised Aggregation for Tabular\nImbalance Regression, featuring two key innovations: (i) the Region-Aware\nMixture Expert, which adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model to capture the underlying\nrelated regions. The statistical information of each Gaussian component is then\nused to synthesize and train region-specific experts to capture the unique\ncharacteristics of their respective regions. (ii) Test-Time Self-Supervised\nExpert Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts region expert weights based on\ntest data features to reinforce expert adaptation across varying test\ndistributions. We evaluated MATI on four real-world tabular imbalance\nregression datasets, including house pricing, bike sharing, and age prediction.\nTo reflect realistic deployment scenarios, we adopted three types of test\ndistributions: a balanced distribution with uniform target frequencies, a\nnormal distribution that follows the training data, and an inverse distribution\nthat emphasizes rare target regions.

As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable\nhigh-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far\nsurpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC)\nstandard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of\nGFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies,\nsystematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and\nindustrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of\nexisting GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization\nstrategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we\nconstruct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective\nMean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the\nmost appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the\nGFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a\nlow-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future\npractical deployments and applications.

There are majorly two challenges in this task: (1) the\ndomain gap and (2) fine-tuning with scarce data. To solve these challenges, we\nrevisit the adapter-based methods, and discover an intriguing insight not\nexplored in previous works: the adapter not only helps the fine-tuning of\ndownstream tasks but also naturally serves as a domain information decoupler.\nThen, we delve into this finding for an interpretation, and find the model's\ninherent structure could lead to a natural decoupling of domain information.\nBuilding upon this insight, we propose the Domain Feature Navigator (DFN),\nwhich is a structure-based decoupler instead of loss-based ones like current\nworks, to capture domain-specific information, thereby directing the model's\nattention towards domain-agnostic knowledge.

Importantly, the\nproposed confidence bound scales with similarity of the test input to the\ntraining data in the implicit feature space of the predictor (for instance,\nbecoming very large when the test input lies far outside of the training data).\nThis desirable last feature is captured by the weighted norm involving the\ninverse-Hessian matrix of the objective function, which is a generalized\nversion of its counterpart in the linear setting, $x^{\\top} \\text{Cov}^{-1} x$.\nOur generalized result can be regarded as a non-asymptotic counterpart of the\nclassical confidence interval based on asymptotic normality of the MLE\nestimator. We propose an efficient method for computing the weighted norm,\nwhich only mildly exceeds the cost of a gradient computation of the loss\nfunction. Finally, we complement our analysis with empirical evidence showing\nthat the proposed confidence bound provides better coverage/width trade-off\ncompared to a confidence estimation by bootstrapping, which is a gold-standard\nmethod in many applications involving non-linear predictors such as neural\nnetworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u2113\u00b2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u70b9\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u968f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u63a8\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u8303\u6570\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u8be5\u8303\u6570\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a9\u6cd5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

However, this\ncompression process introduces inherent semantic degradation that is\nnotoriously difficult to quantify with traditional metrics. To address this,\nthis paper introduces the research problem of Compressed Feature Quality\nAssessment (CFQA), which seeks to evaluate the semantic fidelity of compressed\nfeatures.

Relying on manual delineation introduces\nsignificant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models\nare designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt\nto ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly\nevident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs.\nTherefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image\nsegmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address\nthese challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent\nviewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were\ndesigned to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve\nthe fusion of contextual information.

Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise\nreduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making\nthem difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental\ntrade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of\nExperts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework\nspecifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and\nnoise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction\nExpert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing\nsaturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch\ncomplementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise\nreduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the\nappropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive\nstandard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source\nbenchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified\nevaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods.

A prime\nexample is policy iteration, whose fundamental guarantee of monotonic\nimprovement collapses even under linear function approximation. To address this\nissue, we introduce Reliable Policy Iteration (RPI). It replaces the common\nprojection or Bellman-error minimization during policy evaluation with a\nBellman-based constrained optimization. We prove that not only does RPI confer\ntextbook monotonicity on its value estimates but these estimates also lower\nbound the true return. Also, their limit partially satisfies the unprojected\nBellman equation, emphasizing RPI's natural fit within RL.

Specifically, we\npropose Ambiguity-Restrained representation Learning~(ARL) to address ambiguous\ntext-video pairs.

Uncertainty represents whether instances include\ncommonly shared context across the dataset, while similarity indicates\npair-wise semantic overlap. Then, with the detected ambiguous pairs, our ARL\nhierarchically learns the semantic relationship via multi-positive contrastive\nlearning and dual triplet margin loss. Additionally, we delve into fine-grained\nrelationships within the video instances. Unlike typical training at the\ntext-video level, where pairwise information is provided, we address the\ninherent ambiguity within frames of the same untrimmed video, which often\ncontains multiple contexts. This allows us to further enhance learning at the\ntext-frame level.

These latent sets\nleverage a transformer-based variational autoencoder, simultaneously capturing\n3D shape and motion information. By employing a spatiotemporal,\ntransformer-based diffusion model, information is exchanged across multiple\nlatent frames, enhancing the efficiency and generalization of the generated\nresults.

A key factor influencing\nanswer quality in this setting is the length of the thinking stage. When the\nreasoning is too short, the model may fail to capture the complexity of the\ntask. Conversely, when it is too long, the model may overthink, leading to\nunnecessary computation and degraded performance. This paper explores and\nexploits the underlying mechanisms by which LLMs understand and regulate the\nlength of their reasoning during explicit thought processes. First, we show\nthat LLMs encode their progress through the reasoning process and introduce an\ninteractive progress bar visualization, which is then used to reveal insights\non the model's planning dynamics.

However, existing DP image synthesis methods\nstruggle to produce high resolution outputs that faithfully capture the\nstructure of the original data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method,\nreferred to as Synthesis via Private Textual Intermediaries (SPTI), that can\ngenerate high resolution DP images with easy adoption. The key idea is to shift\nthe challenge of DP image synthesis from the image domain to the text domain by\nleveraging state of the art DP text generation methods. SPTI first summarizes\neach private image into a concise textual description using image to text\nmodels, then applies a modified Private Evolution algorithm to generate DP\ntext, and finally reconstructs images using text to image models. Notably, SPTI\nrequires no model training, only inference with off the shelf models. Given a\nprivate dataset, SPTI produces synthetic images of substantially higher quality\nthan prior DP approaches. On the LSUN Bedroom dataset, SPTI attains an FID less\nthan or equal to 26.71 under epsilon equal to 1.0, improving over Private\nEvolution FID of 40.36. Similarly, on MM CelebA HQ, SPTI achieves an FID less\nthan or equal to 33.27 at epsilon equal to 1.0, compared to 57.01 from DP fine\ntuning baselines.

State-of-the-art propagation modeling\ntools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models.\nHowever, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter\nspace in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies\nmade use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss\npredictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric\nmodels leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of\ntemperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range\npropagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and\ntemperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km\naltitude and 4,000 km distance.

This paper develops a\ntheoretical model to characterize the interplay among sparsification, model\nstaleness and mobility-induced contact patterns, and their joint impact on AFL\nconvergence. Based on the analysis, we propose a mobility-aware dynamic\nsparsification (MADS) algorithm that optimizes the sparsification degree based\non contact time and model staleness. Closed-form solutions are derived, showing\nthat under low-speed conditions, MADS increases the sparsification degree to\nenhance convergence, while under high-speed conditions, it reduces the\nsparsification degree to guarantee reliable uploads within limited contact\ntime. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.

This serialization hinders the model's ability to leverage\nstructural inductive biases, especially in tasks such as retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) and reasoning on data with native graph structures, where\ninter-segment dependencies are crucial. We introduce Graph-KV with the\npotential to overcome this limitation. Graph-KV leverages the KV-cache of text\nsegments as condensed representations and governs their interaction through\nstructural inductive biases. In this framework, 'target' segments selectively\nattend only to the KV-caches of their designated 'source' segments, rather than\nall preceding segments in a serialized sequence. This approach induces a\ngraph-structured block mask, sparsifying attention and enabling a\nmessage-passing-like step within the LLM. Furthermore, strategically allocated\npositional encodings for source and target segments reduce positional bias and\ncontext window consumption.

However, their ability to attend to truly critical\ninformation during long-context reasoning and generation still falls behind the\npace. Specifically, our preliminary experiments reveal that certain distracting\npatterns can misdirect the model's attention during inference, and removing\nthese patterns substantially improves reasoning accuracy and generation\nquality. We attribute this phenomenon to spurious correlations in the training\ndata, which obstruct the model's capacity to infer authentic causal\ninstruction-response relationships. This phenomenon may induce redundant\nreasoning processes, potentially resulting in significant inference overhead\nand, more critically, the generation of erroneous or suboptimal responses. To\nmitigate this, we introduce a two-stage framework called Learning to Focus\n(LeaF) leveraging intervention-based inference to disentangle confounding\nfactors.

The framework's core innovation is the\nintroduction of three synergistic modules: the Hierarchical Edge Module (HEM),\nwhich explicitly extracts a multi-scale pyramid of edge features that\ncorresponds to the semantic hierarchy at early network stages; the Synergistic\nEdge Fusion (SEF) module, for deeply fusing these edge priors with semantic\ninformation at each respective scale; and the Cross Stage Partial Omni-Kernel\nModule (CSPOKM), which maximally refines the most detail-rich feature layers\nusing an Omni-Kernel operator - comprising anisotropic large-kernel\nconvolutions and mixed-domain attention - all within a computationally\nefficient Cross-Stage Partial (CSP) framework. On a large-scale dataset\ncomprising 120 pollen classes, HieraEdgeNet achieves a mean Average Precision\n(mAP@.5) of 0.9501, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline\nmodels such as YOLOv12n and RT-DETR.

We incorporate Segment Anything Model instance masks with\na contrastive loss formulation as guidance for the instance features to achieve\naccurate instance-level segmentation. Furthermore, we utilize language\nembeddings of a vision-language model, allowing for flexible, text-driven\ninstance identification. This combination enables our system to identify and\nsegment arbitrary objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions.\nWe show results on LERF-mask and LERF-OVS as well as the full ScanNet++\nvalidation set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "OpenSplat3D\u6269\u5c55\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c063DGS\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u76843D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\u3001Segment Anything Model\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728LERF-mask\u3001LERF-OVS\u548cScanNet++\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OpenSplat3D\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u52723D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks:\nHeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully\ntrading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be\napplied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine\nthe performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks,\ndemonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with\nminimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy\nregime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections\nbetween LLM watermarking and coding theory.

For code, see\n  https://github.com/opendrivelab/ETA", "summary": "How can we benefit from large models without sacrificing inference speed, a\ncommon dilemma in self-driving systems? A prevalent solution is a dual-system\narchitecture, employing a small model for rapid, reactive decisions and a\nlarger model for slower but more informative analyses. Existing dual-system\ndesigns often implement parallel architectures where inference is either\ndirectly conducted using the large model at each current frame or retrieved\nfrom previously stored inference results. However, these works still struggle\nto enable large models for a timely response to every online frame. Our key\ninsight is to shift intensive computations of the current frame to previous\ntime steps and perform a batch inference of multiple time steps to make large\nmodels respond promptly to each time step. To achieve the shifting, we\nintroduce Efficiency through Thinking Ahead (ETA), an asynchronous system\ndesigned to: (1) propagate informative features from the past to the current\nframe using future predictions from the large model, (2) extract current frame\nfeatures using a small model for real-time responsiveness, and (3) integrate\nthese dual features via an action mask mechanism that emphasizes\naction-critical image regions.

Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose\nthe SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power\nmonocular 3D object detection.

VLAgent has three unique design characteristics: First, we\nimprove the quality of plan generation through in-context learning, improving\nlogic reasoning by reducing erroneous logic steps, incorrect programs, and LLM\nhallucinations. Second, we design a syntax-semantics parser to identify and\ncorrect additional logic errors of the LLM-generated planning script prior to\nlaunching the plan executor.

Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing\nenergy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of\nconverting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of\nenergy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face\ndifficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation.\nPrevious research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the\nenergy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of\nP2G.\n  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be\napplied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and\ngas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex\ncase studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep\nQ-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to\nenhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts,\nimplementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost\ncalculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose M2Restore, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based\nMamba-CNN fusion framework for efficient and robust all-in-one image\nrestoration. M2Restore introduces three key contributions: First, to boost the\nmodel's generalization across diverse degradation conditions, we exploit a\nCLIP-guided MoE gating mechanism that fuses task-conditioned prompts with\nCLIP-derived semantic priors. This mechanism is further refined via cross-modal\nfeature calibration, which enables precise expert selection for various\ndegradation types. Second, to jointly capture global contextual dependencies\nand fine-grained local details, we design a dual-stream architecture that\nintegrates the localized representational strength of CNNs with the long-range\nmodeling efficiency of Mamba. This integration enables collaborative\noptimization of global semantic relationships and local structural fidelity,\npreserving global coherence while enhancing detail restoration. Third, we\nintroduce an edge-aware dynamic gating mechanism that adaptively balances\nglobal modeling and local enhancement by reallocating computational attention\nto degradation-sensitive regions. This targeted focus leads to more efficient\nand precise restoration.

The device-level CGD refers\nto the gradient divergence of the scheduled device group, instead of the sum of\nthe individual device divergence. The sample-level CGD is statistically upper\nbounded by sampling variance, which is inversely proportional to the total\nnumber of samples scheduled for local update. To derive a tractable form of the\ndevice-level CGD, we further consider a classification problem and transform it\ninto the weighted earth moving distance (WEMD) between the group distribution\nand the global distribution. Then we propose FedCGD algorithm to minimize the\nsum of multi-level CGDs by balancing WEMD and sampling variance, within\npolynomial time. Simulation shows that the proposed strategy increases\nclassification accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset by up to 4.2\\% while scheduling\n41.8\\% fewer devices, and flexibly switches between reducing WEMD and reducing\nsampling variance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u8bbe\u5907\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565FedCGD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u7ea7\u96c6\u4f53\u68af\u5ea6\u53d1\u6563\uff08CGD\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bbe\u5907\u8c03\u5ea6\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u662f\u5f71\u54cdFL\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u7ec4\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86FL\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53d7\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7CGD\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7CGD\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u52a0\u6743\u5730\u7403\u79fb\u52a8\u8ddd\u79bb\uff08WEMD\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faFedCGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861WEMD\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFedCGD\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.2%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1141.8%\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "FedCGD\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea7CGD\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347FL\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7075\u6d3b\u6743\u8861WEMD\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u3002"}}

These capabilities enable\nsystems to better interpret the camera wearer's actions, intentions, and\nsurrounding environment. However, building large-scale egocentric multimodal\nand multitask models presents unique challenges. Egocentric data are inherently\nheterogeneous, with large variations in modality coverage across devices and\nsettings. Generating pseudo-labels for missing modalities, such as gaze or\nhead-mounted camera trajectories, is often infeasible, making standard\nsupervised learning approaches difficult to scale. Furthermore, dynamic camera\nmotion and the complex temporal and spatial structure of first-person video\npose additional challenges for the direct application of existing multimodal\nfoundation models.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce a set of efficient temporal\ntokenizers and propose EgoM2P, a masked modeling framework that learns from\ntemporally aware multimodal tokens to train a large, general-purpose model for\negocentric 4D understanding. This unified design supports multitasking across\ndiverse egocentric perception and synthesis tasks, including gaze prediction,\negocentric camera tracking, and monocular depth estimation from egocentric\nvideo. EgoM2P also serves as a generative model for conditional egocentric\nvideo synthesis. Across these tasks, EgoM2P matches or outperforms specialist\nmodels while being an order of magnitude faster.

Second, we discover that all\nexisting methods crucially depend on model similarity. They work best when\ninterpolating scores among similar models.

In this setting of extrapolation, none of the previous\nmethods consistently beat a simple average over random samples. To improve over\nthe sample average, we introduce a new method inspired by augmented inverse\npropensity weighting. This method consistently outperforms the random sample\naverage even for extrapolation. However, its performance still relies on model\nsimilarity and the gains are modest in general.

(2) The open-source WeThink dataset containing over 120K\nmultimodal QA pairs with annotated reasoning paths, curated from 18 diverse\ndataset sources and covering various question domains. (3) A comprehensive\nexploration of RL on our dataset, incorporating a hybrid reward mechanism that\ncombines rule-based verification with model-based assessment to optimize RL\ntraining efficiency across various task domains. Across 14 diverse MLLM\nbenchmarks, we demonstrate that our WeThink dataset significantly enhances\nperformance, from mathematical reasoning to diverse general multimodal tasks.\nMoreover, we show that our automated data pipeline can continuously increase\ndata diversity to further improve model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001QA\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6WeThink\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63a2\u7d22\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DeepSeek-R1\uff09\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001QA\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b12\u4e07\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001QA\u7684WeThink\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3. \u63a2\u7d22\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "WeThink\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e8614\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for\ncompositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial\ncapabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities.

With over 150+\nhours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor\nscenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud\ninput and multi-choice QA.

These limitations could be more severe for\nmodels with fewer parameters. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework inspired by cybernetic principles, redesigning video MLLMs as\nadaptive systems capable of self-monitoring, self-correction, and dynamic\nresource allocation during inference. Our approach, CyberV, introduces a\ncybernetic loop consisting of an MLLM Inference System, a Sensor, and a\nController. Specifically, the sensor monitors forward processes of the MLLM and\ncollects intermediate interpretations, such as attention drift, then the\ncontroller determines when and how to trigger self-correction and generate\nfeedback to guide the next round. This test-time adaptive scaling framework\nenhances frozen MLLMs without requiring retraining or additional components.\nExperiments demonstrate significant improvements: CyberV boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B\nby 8.3% and InternVL3-8B by 5.5% on VideoMMMU, surpassing the competitive\nproprietary model GPT-4o. When applied to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, it yields a 10.0%\nimprovement, achieving performance even comparable to human experts.\nFurthermore, our method demonstrates consistent gains on general-purpose\nbenchmarks, such as VideoMME and WorldSense, highlighting its effectiveness and\ngeneralization capabilities in making MLLMs more robust and accurate for\ndynamic video understanding.

Take the phrase \"ribonucleic\nacid\" as an example: an LLM will first decompose it into tokens, i.e.,\nartificial text fragments (\"rib\", \"on\", ...), then learn each token\nsequentially, rather than grasping the phrase as a unified, coherent semantic\nentity. This fragmented representation hinders deeper conceptual understanding\nand, ultimately, the development of truly intelligent systems. In response, we\nintroduce Concept-Aware Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a novel multi-token training method\nthat redefines how LLMs are fine-tuned.

This process heavily demands the high accuracy of\nencoders and decoders, which can be problematic for applications with limited\ndata. To lift this restriction, we propose a novel framework for building\nmultimodal diffusion models on arbitrary state spaces, enabling native\ngeneration of coupled data across different modalities. By introducing an\ninnovative decoupled noise schedule for each modality, we enable both\nunconditional and modality-conditioned generation within a single model\nsimultaneously.

These advances motivate a new paradigm, termed\n`hyperpruning', which seeks to identify the most suitable pruning strategy for\na given network architecture and application. Unlike conventional\nhyperparameter search, where the optimal configuration's accuracy remains\nuncertain, in the context of network pruning, the accuracy of the dense model\nsets the target for the accuracy of the pruned one. The goal, therefore, is to\ndiscover pruned variants that match or even surpass this established accuracy.\nHowever, exhaustive search over pruning configurations is computationally\nexpensive and lacks early performance guarantees. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel Lyapunov Spectrum (LS)-based distance metric that enables early\ncomparison between pruned and dense networks, allowing accurate prediction of\npost-training performance. By integrating this LS-based distance with standard\nhyperparameter optimization algorithms, we introduce an efficient hyperpruning\nframework, termed LS-based Hyperpruning (LSH).

Although deep learning and\ndiffusion-based methods have shown promising results, they often lack physical\ninterpretability or suffer from high computational costs due to iterative\nsampling starting from random noise. Recent advances in generative modeling,\nparticularly Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM), enable high-fidelity image\nsynthesis by modeling the full data distribution. In this work, we propose\nResidual Poisson Flow (ResPF) Generative Models for efficient and accurate\nsparse-view CT reconstruction. Based on PFGM++, ResPF integrates conditional\nguidance from sparse measurements and employs a hijacking strategy to\nsignificantly reduce sampling cost by skipping redundant initial steps.\nHowever, skipping early stages can degrade reconstruction quality and introduce\nunrealistic structures. To address this, we embed a data-consistency into each\niteration, ensuring fidelity to sparse-view measurements.

Recent\nadvancements in contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained models highlight the\npotential of exploiting the additional patient-level self-supervisory signals\ninherent in ECG. They are referred to as patient contrastive learning. Its\nrationale is that multiple physical recordings from the same patient may share\ncommonalities, termed patient consistency, so redefining positive and negative\npairs in contrastive learning as intrapatient and inter-patient samples\nprovides more shared context to learn an effective representation. However,\nthese methods still fail to efficiently exploit patient consistency due to the\ninsufficient amount of intra-inter patient samples existing in a batch. Hence,\nwe propose a contrastive learning-based ECG pretrained model enhanced by the\nPatient Memory Queue (PMQ), which incorporates a large patient memory queue to\nmitigate model degeneration that can arise from insufficient intra-inter\npatient samples. In order to further enhance the performance of the pretrained\nmodel, we introduce two extra data augmentation methods to provide more\nperspectives of positive and negative pairs for pretraining.

To develop a nuclei segmentation\nalgorithm, applicable to different types of target domain representations,\nimage-to-image translation networks can be considered as they are invariant to\ntarget domain image representations. One of the important issues with\nimage-to-image translation models is that they fail miserably when the\ninformation content between two image domains are asymmetric in nature. In this\nregard, the paper introduces a new deep generative model for segmenting nuclei\nstructures from histological images. The proposed model considers an embedding\nspace for handling information-disparity between information-rich histological\nimage space and information-poor segmentation map domain. Integrating\njudiciously the concepts of optimal transport and measure theory, the model\ndevelops an invertible generator, which provides an efficient optimization\nframework with lower network complexity. The concept of invertible generator\nautomatically eliminates the need of any explicit cycle-consistency loss.

While color normalization enables better nuclei\nsegmentation, accurate segmentation of nuclei structures makes color\nnormalization rather trivial. In this respect, the paper proposes a novel deep\ngenerative model for simultaneously segmenting nuclei structures and\nnormalizing color appearance of stained histological images.This model\njudiciously integrates the merits of truncated normal distribution and spatial\nattention. The model assumes that the latent color appearance information,\ncorresponding to a particular histological image, is independent of respective\nnuclei segmentation map as well as embedding map information. The disentangled\nrepresentation makes the model generalizable and adaptable as the modification\nor loss in color appearance information cannot be able to affect the nuclei\nsegmentation map as well as embedding information. Also, for dealing with the\nstain overlap of associated histochemical reagents, the prior for latent color\nappearance code is assumed to be a mixture of truncated normal distributions.\nThe proposed model incorporates the concept of spatial attention for\nsegmentation of nuclei regions from histological images.

We evaluate\nChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs\n(GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows,\nwhile more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o.\nImportantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks\nthrough a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed\nGPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChemGraph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0cChemGraph\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684LLMs\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ChemGraph\u901a\u8fc7AI\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u539f\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained significant attention for\nhigh-quality and efficient view synthesis, making it widely adopted in fields\nsuch as AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous driving. Despite its impressive\nalgorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices\nremains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper\npresents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies.\nFirst, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of\ncommon terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve\nthis, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses\nshared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design,\neffectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by\nidentifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process,\nwe introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent\nblending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for\ncostly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to\nimprove its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization\nand neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing\narray that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and\nHilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves\nrendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy\nsavings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

This paper argues that constraints in NI are paradoxically\ncatalysts for efficiency, adaptability, and creativity. We first show how\nlimited neural bandwidth promotes concise codes that still capture complex\npatterns. Spiking neurons, hierarchical structures, and symbolic-like\nrepresentations emerge naturally from bandwidth constraints, enabling robust\ngeneralization. Next, we discuss chaotic itinerancy, illustrating how the brain\ntransits among transient attractors to flexibly retrieve memories and manage\nuncertainty.

However, its effectiveness in\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains uncertain. Applying\nDifferential Privacy (DP) inherently introduces substantial computation\noverhead, a concern particularly relevant for MLLMs which process extensive\ntextual and visual data. Furthermore, a critical challenge of DP is that the\ninjected noise, necessary for privacy, scales with parameter dimensionality,\nleading to pronounced model degradation; This trade-off between privacy and\nutility complicates the application of Differential Privacy (DP) to complex\narchitectures like MLLMs. To address these, we propose Dual-Priv Pruning, a\nframework that employs two complementary pruning mechanisms for DP fine-tuning\nin MLLMs: (i) visual token pruning to reduce input dimensionality by removing\nredundant visual information, and (ii) gradient-update pruning during the DP\noptimization process. This second mechanism selectively prunes parameter\nupdates based on the magnitude of noisy gradients, aiming to mitigate noise\nimpact and improve utility. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\ncompetitive results with minimal performance degradation. In terms of\ncomputational efficiency, our approach consistently utilizes less memory than\nstandard DP-SGD. While requiring only 1.74% more memory than zeroth-order\nmethods which suffer from severe performance issues on A100 GPUs, our method\ndemonstrates leading memory efficiency on H20 GPUs.

A nonlinear controller manages the intrinsic Hamiltonian flow,\ndetermining a desired port control value $\\Pi_c$. Concurrently, Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) is applied to the dissipative/input flow to learn an agent for\nproviding optimal policy in mapping $\\Pi_c$ to the actual system input.

Second, we propose a\nselective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to\nachieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal\ncontexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a\nhyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling.\nBy treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent\nrepresentation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the\nfused bi-directional temporal priors.

However, performing per-Gaussian\nneural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting\nrendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper,\nwe present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general\npipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS\nrepresentations by reducing neural inference through two complementary\ntechniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that\nidentifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene\nreconstruction.

A central question in this setting is\nwhether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be\n(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its\nsample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \\emph{sample\ncompressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a\nstructural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees\nPAC-learnability.

It identifies problematic PCs using a\nset-associative H2P Identification Table (HIT) and steers them to one of two\nbranch-specific perceptrons, one indexed by hashed local history and the other\nby folded global history. A short trial phase tracks head-to-head accuracy in\nan H2P cache. A branch becomes perceptron-resident only if the perceptron's\nsustained accuracy and output magnitude exceed dynamic thresholds, after which\nTAGE updates for that PC are suppressed to reduce pollution.

Moreover, our method\nis general and allows for debiasing any state-of-the-art ranking algorithm by\nplugging it into the second stage.

Specifically,\nwe design three lightweight and coordinated MTD mechanisms, including leader\nswitching, route mutation, and frequency hopping, that leverage the inherent\nflexibility of UAV swarms to disrupt attacker efforts and enhance network\nresilience. The defense problem is formulated as a multi-agent partially\nobservable Markov decision process (POMDP), capturing the distributed,\nresource-constrained, and uncertain nature of UAV swarms under attack. Each UAV\nis equipped with a local policy agent that autonomously selects MTD actions\nbased on partial observations and local experiences. By employing a policy\ngradient-based FMADRL algorithm, UAVs collaboratively optimize their defense\npolicies via reward-weighted aggregation, enabling distributed learning without\nsharing raw data and thus reducing communication overhead. Extensive\nsimulations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 34.6% improvement in attack\nmitigation rate, a reduction in average recovery time of up to 94.6%, and\ndecreases in energy consumption and defense cost by as much as 29.3% and 98.3%,\nrespectively, while maintaining robust mission continuity under various DoS\nattack strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FMADRL\uff09\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u9632\u5fa1\uff08MTD\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94DoS\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u65e0\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5176\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684DoS\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u6216\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u7684MTD\u673a\u5236\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u5207\u6362\u3001\u8def\u7531\u53d8\u5f02\u548c\u9891\u7387\u8df3\u53d8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9632\u5fa1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDP\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528FMADRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u7f13\u89e3\u7387\u63d0\u534734.6%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6062\u590d\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1194.6%\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6210\u672c\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e29.3%\u548c98.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7fa4\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6297DoS\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

We evaluate MoE-MLoRA\nacross eight CTR models on Movielens and Taobao, showing that it improves\nperformance in large-scale, dynamic datasets (+1.45 Weighed-AUC in Taobao-20)\nbut offers limited benefits in structured datasets with low domain diversity\nand sparsity. Further analysis of the number of experts per domain reveals that\nlarger ensembles do not always improve performance, indicating the need for\nmodel-aware tuning.

Experiments demonstrate that\nour method outperforms baselines in integer compressive sensing and integer\nleast squares.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u4e0a\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b50\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u5dee\uff08DS\uff09\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u96c6\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684DC\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b50\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u96c6\u5408\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684DC\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff08DCA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eDS\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u57df\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u6570\u538b\u7f29\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6574\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06DS\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

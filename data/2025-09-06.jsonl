Our approach\ntargets \\emph{entity-level hallucinations} -- e.g., fabricated names, dates,\ncitations -- rather than claim-level, thereby naturally mapping to token-level\nlabels and enabling streaming detection. We develop an annotation methodology\nthat leverages web search to annotate model responses with grounded labels\nindicating which tokens correspond to fabricated entities. This dataset enables\nus to train effective hallucination classifiers with simple and efficient\nmethods such as linear probes. Evaluating across four model families, our\nclassifiers consistently outperform baselines on long-form responses, including\nmore expensive methods such as semantic entropy (e.g., AUC 0.90 vs 0.71 for\nLlama-3.3-70B), and are also an improvement in short-form question-answering\nsettings. Moreover, despite being trained only with entity-level labels, our\nprobes effectively detect incorrect answers in mathematical reasoning tasks,\nindicating generalization beyond entities. While our annotation methodology is\nexpensive, we find that annotated responses from one model can be used to train\neffective classifiers on other models; accordingly, we publicly release our\ndatasets to facilitate reuse. Overall, our work suggests a promising new\napproach for scalable, real-world hallucination detection."}

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration.

In this paper, we introduce the\nLibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed\nfor both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The\ntraining dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K\nhours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each\nutterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it\nwas written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to\ndescribe the quotation (\\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,\nwe provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS\nsystems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's\nability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference\ntimbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide\nrange of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various\naccents.

Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:\ntourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business\nformats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces."}

In the challenging setting\nof matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the\neffect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences\nshould be established. This is because object parts that enable specific\nfunctions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the\ndefinition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and\npropose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.\nThe main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language\nmodels to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then\nintegrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to\ndistill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can\nestablish dense functional correspondence.

In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown\nthat on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost\nall its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible\nworlds than the uniform distribution does."}

By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously\ndiagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a\nclosed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently\npropagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally\narises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention\nweights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated\npairwise precisions.

Our analysis reveals\nthat puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments\", ``length-scaling'' and entropy\ndynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning\nhierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from\nlow-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling\ntwo-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness\nand must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively\nshifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of\nhigh-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in\nprevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure\nagnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this,\nwe propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that\nconcentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA\nsignificantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this\nstrategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we\nvalidate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic\nexploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy."}

To address\nkey limitations in modeling spatio-temporal dependencies and exploiting\nmulti-source data for parking availability prediction, this study proposes a\nnovel approach with SST-iTransformer. The methodology leverages K-means\nclustering to establish parking cluster zones (PCZs), extracting and\nintegrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes\n(i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) associated with the targeted\nparking lots. Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates\nmasking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal\nrepresentation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention\nmechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via\npatching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions\nthrough inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from\nChengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep\nlearning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and\niTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean\nsquared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive\nablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different\ndata sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance\ngains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)\ncontribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that\nexcluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to\nsubstantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling\nspatial dependencies."}

Unlike conventional person search,\nthis task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal\nalignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly\nrecognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose\nAnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person\nanomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline\nintegrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric\nanomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked\ncross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware\nre-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues.

Most lightweight networks\nuse attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly\ncapture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex\ntextures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a\ntraining-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an\nefficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the\nShape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches\n-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other\nusing a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness.

In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport.

Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation.

Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media.

Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume.

We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the\neffectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT\nconsistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and\nfamilies."}

We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand\nexoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision\n+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural\nenvironments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,\nproviding users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors\nthe human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of\ndemonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make\ntask demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation,\nincreasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of\ndexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect\nhigh-quality demonstration data at scale. Policies learned with DEXOP data\nsignificantly improve task performance per unit time of data collection\ncompared to teleoperation, making DEXOP a powerful tool for advancing robot\ndexterity.

However, navigating and understanding these models\nremains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories.\nWe introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as\nvector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to\na base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and\ntask, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also\ndemonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and\nexhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition,\nwe show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and\nfurther explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta\nActivations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models.\nCode is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations."}

The primary task is forecasting\nfuture values of these signals at the service level. In addition, ChronoGraph\nprovides expert-annotated incident windows as anomaly labels, enabling\nevaluation of anomaly detection methods and assessment of forecast robustness\nduring operational disruptions. Compared to existing benchmarks from industrial\ncontrol systems or traffic and air-quality domains, ChronoGraph uniquely\ncombines (i) multivariate time series, (ii) an explicit, machine-readable\ndependency graph, and (iii) anomaly labels aligned with real incidents. We\nreport baseline results spanning forecasting models, pretrained time-series\nfoundation models, and standard anomaly detectors. ChronoGraph offers a\nrealistic benchmark for studying structure-aware forecasting and incident-aware\nevaluation in microservice systems."}

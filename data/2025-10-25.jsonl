This paper presents a\nconfiguration-dependent kinematic calibration framework for improving accuracy\nacross the entire workspace. Local Product-of-Exponential (POE) models,\nselected for their parameterization continuity, are identified at multiple\nconfigurations and interpolated into a global model. Inspired by joint gravity\nload expressions, we employ Fourier basis function interpolation parameterized\nby the shoulder and elbow joint angles, achieving accuracy comparable to neural\nnetwork and autoencoder methods but with substantially higher training\nefficiency. Validation on two 6-DoF industrial robots shows that the proposed\napproach reduces the maximum positioning error by over 50%, meeting the\nsub-millimeter accuracy required for cold spray manufacturing. Robots with\nlarger configuration-dependent discrepancies benefit even more. A dual-robot\ncollaborative task demonstrates the framework's practical applicability and\nrepeatability."}

However, its\nquadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.\nGiven that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing\nefforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\\times3$ kernels, ATConv\nconsistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.\nBuilding on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain\n\\textbf{84.4\\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In\ndiffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\\times\n3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster\nsampling.

To this end, a prescribed cyclic\npick-and-place operation is analyzed and a dynamic model of SEA driven PKM is\nderived. Subsequently, an energy minimizing optimal control problem is\nformulated where operating trajectories as well as SEA stiffnesses are\noptimized simultaneously. Here, optimizing the actuator stiffness does not\naccount for variable stiffness actuators. It serves as a tool for the design\nand dimensioning process. The hypothesis on energy reduction is tested on two\n(parallel) robot applications where redundant actuation is also addressed. The\nresults confirm the validity of this approach."}

However,\nexisting Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language\nfield, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic\nsegmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,\nwe present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that\ncontributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation\ncues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of\ncollaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the\ncornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the\ncollaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship\nbetween the instance field and language field, through a novel\ninstance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage\ntraining strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the\ntwo fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt\nrefinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference.

Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations\ncan align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed\nlength. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length\nperturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been\noverlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical\nproperties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which\nadaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we\nprovide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using\n$\\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to\na wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic\nproblems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional\nmethods under specific conditions."}

While MBR has proven effective in machine\ntranslation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is\nnaturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as\ndialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,\napplying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in\nselecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's\ndistribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of\ngenerations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we\nintroduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to\nmake MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test\nour hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of\nlatent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a\nsentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate\nthe structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common\nsimilarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,\nour proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,\nwe evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,\nAlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity\nimproves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate."}

By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide\ninterpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,\nand syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational\nrepresentations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well\nas incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be\nmore limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation\nand linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid\napproach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with\nthe symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational\nrepresentations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for\nrephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source\nof information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically.

Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs\nsometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,\nleaking employee salaries in meeting summaries).

Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)\ncan process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long\nsequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or\ninconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most\ninformative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal\ndependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide\ncomplete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus\nEvidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video\nunderstanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two\nkey components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module\nselects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM\nreasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns\nembeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus\nRefinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and\nvisual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.\nExtensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and\nrobustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection\nfor Video-LLMs."}

In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result\nsolely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?\nAfter a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the\nrisk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased\nreliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\"\nframework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed\ncontexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,\nand ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual\ndecoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy.

Using video data\nfrom Wolf et al.

After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,\nincluding range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase\ndurations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for\nwithin-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM\nrepetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,\nparticularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed\nthat participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were\nthe primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of\nheterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \\%ROM, which\nis the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this\ndefinition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across\nexercises.

However, few practical approaches achieve the\ngold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples\nexactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the\nselective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition\nof this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation\nerror, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced\nslack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --\noften believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on\nclosing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.\nBridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively\nreorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our\ndecomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language\nbenchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our\nresults confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for\nsubstantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully\nimprove score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that\ndemands distributionally robust training.

We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity.

The proposed framework achieves 99.24\\% accuracy on the 7K-DS\ndataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\\% and 99.85\\% in the 3-class\nand 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model\ngeneralizes with 95.77\\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art\nmethods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user\ninterface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor\nlocalization.

Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks.

To fill this gap, this paper\ninvestigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a\ntypical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining\ndifferences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from\nthree types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision\nmaking. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias\nacross gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in\nlarge-scale assessment of collaboration and communication."}

Our results show that while there are significant hurdles\nin leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results\nwhen combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies."}

Multi-variate time-series analysis has\nemerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in\nsuch environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication\npresents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor\ndata and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,\nthe complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly\nprediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to\nadvance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential\nstep toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault\nprevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:\n(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,\nand (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is\ncompared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a\npredefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the\nforecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by\nutilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second\nlifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture\ninter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting\nperformance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly\nprediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS\nmodel while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower\ncomputational cost.

Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further\nincrease the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the\ndetecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can\npotentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle\ninfluences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between\nLLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation\napproaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world\ndetector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often\nmisunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors\nremain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be\ninterpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators."}

The main challenges lie in precisely\nlocalizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate\ndispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free\nframework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight\ndraft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as\ndraft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization\ncandidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to\nproduce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering\ncorrect answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a\nconsensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement\nreasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on\nchallenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering\nbenchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.\nBy synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning\npaths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large\nproprietary models or training pipelines.

Our\nframework advocates \"closing the loop\" of developing manipulation policies with\nreproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real\npolicy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering\nof diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian\nScene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with\nrobot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we\ncurate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and\nbimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with\nphysics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)\nlearning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with\nphoto-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection\nfor adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking\nof real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data\ncollection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual\nreinforcement learning.

We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that\ndecouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner\nlearns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model\nlearns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost\nsimulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that\nlets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that\nthe affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments\nshow that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex\noutdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning\nmethods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied\nnavigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using\nnatural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key\nto embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed\nacross physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model\nsignificantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success\nrates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:\nhttps://vamos-vla.github.io/"}

While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home."}

### [1] [Rethinking the Illusion of Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01231)
*Iñaki Dellibarda Varela,Pablo Romero-Sorozabal,Eduardo Rocon,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文澄清了关于大型推理模型（LRMs）是否具备真正推理能力的争议，通过改进实验方法，发现LRMs在复杂任务中表现有限，但在可解问题中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI社区对LRMs是否具备真正推理能力的争议，澄清先前研究的实验缺陷和结论。

Method: 复制并改进原始研究中的两个争议性基准（Towers of Hanoi和River Crossing），引入逐步提示和协作对话方法。

Result: LRMs在复杂任务（如8个盘子的Towers of Hanoi）中表现有限，但在可解问题（如100对代理的River Crossing）中表现优异。

Conclusion: LRMs是离散状态空间中的随机搜索器，未来需要在符号推理和长期规划方面进行更精细的研究。

Abstract: Earlier this year, Apple ignited controversy by publishing "The Illusion of
Thinking," prompting heated debate within the AI community. Critics seized upon
the findings as conclusive evidence that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) lack
genuine reasoning capabilities, branding them as mere stochastic parrots.
Meanwhile, defenders-spearheaded by Lawsen et al. (2025)-fired back, condemning
the experimental setup as flawed and the conclusions overstated. We clarify
this debate by replicating and refining two of the original study's most
contentious benchmarks: Towers of Hanoi and River Crossing. By introducing
incremental stepwise prompting and agentic collaborative dialogue, we show that
previously reported failures solving the Towers of Hanoi were not purely result
of output constraints, but also partly a result of cognition limitations: LRMs
still stumble when complexity rises moderately (around 8 disks). Moreover, the
River Crossing results initially heralded as catastrophic failures turn out to
hinge upon testing unsolvable configurations. Once we limit tests strictly to
solvable problems-LRMs effortlessly solve large instances involving over 100
agent pairs. Our findings ultimately defy simplistic narratives: today's LRMs
are stochastic, RL-tuned searchers in a discrete state space we barely
understand. Real progress in symbolic, long-horizon reasoning demands mapping
that terrain through fine-grained ablations like those introduced here.

### [2] [Beyond Black-Box AI: Interpretable Hybrid Systems for Dementia Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01282)
*Matthew JY Kang,Wenli Yang,Monica R Roberts,Byeong Ho Kang,Charles B Malpas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗诊断中的局限性，特别是在痴呆症诊断和护理中，提出结合统计学习和专家知识的混合方法以提高可解释性和临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在基准测试中表现优异，但在实际临床环境中未能显著提升诊断效果，因此需要探索其局限性并提出改进方向。

Method: 通过范围综述，分析了LLM在临床环境中的局限性，并提出结合统计学习和专家知识的混合方法（如PEIRS和ATHENA-CDS）。

Result: 研究发现，LLM的黑箱输出、幻觉问题和弱因果推理限制了其临床实用性，而混合方法能提高可解释性和工作流程适配性。

Conclusion: 未来AI决策支持应注重解释性，结合神经符号或混合AI，并关注临床医生理解和患者结果，以推动AI在临床实践中的应用。

Abstract: The recent boom of large language models (LLMs) has re-ignited the hope that
artificial intelligence (AI) systems could aid medical diagnosis. Yet despite
dazzling benchmark scores, LLM assistants have yet to deliver measurable
improvements at the bedside. This scoping review aims to highlight the areas
where AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,
specifically in dementia diagnosis and care.
  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom
provide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent
use of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or
speed. Key limitations trace to the data-driven paradigm: black-box outputs
which lack transparency, vulnerability to hallucinations, and weak causal
reasoning. Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert
rule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring
back interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,
as seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.
  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking
predictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through
neuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with
human causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with
explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further
advancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge
integration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches. Future research should
measure success not only by accuracy but by improvements in clinician
understanding, workflow fit, and patient outcomes. A better understanding of
what helps improve human-computer interactions is greatly needed for AI systems
to become part of clinical practice.

### [3] [AI Agents and Agentic AI-Navigating a Plethora of Concepts for Future Manufacturing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01376)
*Yinwang Ren,Yangyang Liu,Tang Ji,Xun Xu*

Result: 研究发现这些新兴AI范式在智能制造中具有广阔的应用前景，但仍面临定义模糊和技术挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为AI代理技术在智能制造中的进一步发展和应用提供了系统性的综述和方向指引。

Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive, reason, and act within
dynamic environments. With the rapid advancements in generative AI (GenAI),
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved AI agents' capabilities in semantic comprehension,
complex reasoning, and autonomous decision-making. At the same time, the rise
of Agentic AI highlights adaptability and goal-directed autonomy in dynamic and
complex environments. LLMs-based AI Agents (LLM-Agents), MLLMs-based AI Agents
(MLLM-Agents), and Agentic AI contribute to expanding AI's capabilities in
information processing, environmental perception, and autonomous
decision-making, opening new avenues for smart manufacturing. However, the
definitions, capability boundaries, and practical applications of these
emerging AI paradigms in smart manufacturing remain unclear. To address this
gap, this study systematically reviews the evolution of AI and AI agent
technologies, examines the core concepts and technological advancements of
LLM-Agents, MLLM-Agents, and Agentic AI, and explores their potential
applications in and integration into manufacturing, along with the potential
challenges they may face.

Conclusion: 该方法为道德机器的伦理决策提供了一种可行的形式化框架。

Abstract: The ontological and epistemic complexities inherent in the moral domain make
it challenging to establish clear standards for evaluating the performance of a
moral machine. In this paper, we present a formal method to describe Ethical
Decision Making models based on ethical risk assessment. Then, we show how
these models that are specified as fuzzy rules can be verified and validated
using fuzzy Petri nets. A case study from the medical field is considered to
illustrate the proposed approach.

Result: 在20多所机构的课程中部署，评分超过30万份作业，评分时间平均减少65%，高置信度预测与教师评分一致率达95.4%。

Conclusion: Pensieve通过AI辅助显著提升了评分效率，同时保持了高准确性，适用于多学科STEM课程。

Abstract: Grading handwritten, open-ended responses remains a major bottleneck in large
university STEM courses. We introduce Pensieve (https://www.pensieve.co), an
AI-assisted grading platform that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
transcribe and evaluate student work, providing instructors with rubric-aligned
scores, transcriptions, and confidence ratings. Unlike prior tools that focus
narrowly on specific tasks like transcription or rubric generation, Pensieve
supports the entire grading pipeline-from scanned student submissions to final
feedback-within a human-in-the-loop interface.
  Pensieve has been deployed in real-world courses at over 20 institutions and
has graded more than 300,000 student responses. We present system details and
empirical results across four core STEM disciplines: Computer Science,
Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. Our findings show that Pensieve reduces
grading time by an average of 65%, while maintaining a 95.4% agreement rate
with instructor-assigned grades for high-confidence predictions.

adopting emerging technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming
a necessity to achieve these goals, the risk of hallucination remains a major
challenge. In this paper, we present a multi-agent system to handle customer
requests sent via SMS. This system integrates LLM based agents with fuzzy logic
to mitigate hallucination risks.

### [7] [Agent-as-Tool: A Study on the Hierarchical Decision Making with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01489)
*Yanfei Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个分层框架Agent-as-tool，将工具调用和推理过程分离，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究同时处理工具调用和推理过程，导致模型负担过重，影响推理能力。

Method: 采用分层框架，将工具调用和推理过程分离，分别由不同代理处理。

Result: 在少量样本微调后取得优异表现，Bamboogle任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 分层框架有效减轻模型负担，显著提升推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most significant
technological advancements in artificial intelligence in recent years. Their
ability to understand, generate, and reason with natural language has
transformed how we interact with AI systems. With the development of LLM-based
agents and reinforcement-learning-based reasoning models, the study of applying
reinforcement learning in agent frameworks has become a new research focus.
However, all previous studies face the challenge of deciding the tool calling
process and the reasoning process simultaneously, and the chain of reasoning
was solely relied on the unprocessed raw result with redundant information and
symbols unrelated to the task from the tool, which impose a heavy burden on the
model's capability to reason. Therefore, in our research, we proposed a
hierarchical framework Agent-as-tool that detach the tool calling process and
the reasoning process, which enables the model to focus on the verbally
reasoning process while the tool calling process is handled by another agent.
Our work had achieved comparable results with only a slight reinforcement
fine-tuning on 180 samples, and had achieved exceptionally well performance in
Bamboogle with 63.2% of exact match and 75.2% in cover exact match, exceeding
Search-R1 by 4.8% in exact match and 3.2% in cover exact match.

### [8] [T3DM: Test-Time Training-Guided Distribution Shift Modelling for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01597)
*Yuehang Si,Zefan Zeng,Jincai Huang,Qing Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的分布特征建模方法T3DM，用于解决TKG推理中的分布偏移和负采样质量问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TKG推理方法在建模训练与测试样本间的事件分布偏移和生成高质量负样本方面存在不足。

Method: 提出T3DM方法，通过测试时训练调整模型以适应分布偏移，并设计基于对抗训练的负采样策略。

Result: 实验表明T3DM在多数情况下优于现有基线方法，结果更优且更稳健。

Conclusion: T3DM有效解决了分布偏移和负采样问题，提升了TKG推理的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an efficient method for describing the
dynamic development of facts along a timeline. Most research on TKG reasoning
(TKGR) focuses on modelling the repetition of global facts and designing
patterns of local historical facts. However, they face two significant
challenges: inadequate modeling of the event distribution shift between
training and test samples, and reliance on random entity substitution for
generating negative samples, which often results in low-quality sampling. To
this end, we propose a novel distributional feature modeling approach for
training TKGR models, Test-Time Training-guided Distribution shift Modelling
(T3DM), to adjust the model based on distribution shift and ensure the global
consistency of model reasoning. In addition, we design a negative-sampling
strategy to generate higher-quality negative quadruples based on adversarial
training. Extensive experiments show that T3DM provides better and more robust
results than the state-of-the-art baselines in most cases.

Result: 代理方法在创意质量、相关性和新颖性上显著优于单独使用LLMs。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和代理工作流可显著提升从专利数据生成商业创意的潜力。

Abstract: Patents contain rich technical knowledge that can inspire innovative product
ideas, yet accessing and interpreting this information remains a challenge.
This work explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to mine and generate product concepts from a given patent. In this work,
we design Agent Ideate, a framework for automatically generating product-based
business ideas from patents. We experimented with open-source LLMs and
agent-based architectures across three domains: Computer Science, Natural
Language Processing, and Material Chemistry. Evaluation results show that the
agentic approach consistently outperformed standalone LLMs in terms of idea
quality, relevance, and novelty. These findings suggest that combining LLMs
with agentic workflows can significantly enhance the innovation pipeline by
unlocking the untapped potential of business idea generation from patent data.

### [10] [Joint Matching and Pricing for Crowd-shipping with In-store Customers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01749)
*Arash Dehghan,Mucahit Cevik,Merve Bodur,Bissan Ghaddar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文研究了利用店内顾客作为配送员的集中式众包配送系统，提出了一种结合NeurADP和DDQN的动态优化策略，显著降低了配送成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对城市地区最后一公里配送效率的需求增长，探索利用现有顾客资源进行众包配送的可行性。

Method: 提出基于MDP的模型，结合NeurADP进行订单分配和DDQN进行动态定价，实现多目的地路由和不确定性管理。

Result: 实验显示，NeurADP + DDQN策略比固定定价节省6.7%，比短视基线节省18%，灵活延迟和多目的地路由进一步降低成本。

Conclusion: 动态前瞻性策略在众包配送系统中具有显著优势，为城市物流运营商提供了实用指导。

Abstract: This paper examines the use of in-store customers as delivery couriers in a
centralized crowd-shipping system, targeting the growing need for efficient
last-mile delivery in urban areas. We consider a brick-and-mortar retail
setting where shoppers are offered compensation to deliver time-sensitive
online orders. To manage this process, we propose a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) model that captures key uncertainties, including the stochastic arrival
of orders and crowd-shippers, and the probabilistic acceptance of delivery
offers. Our solution approach integrates Neural Approximate Dynamic Programming
(NeurADP) for adaptive order-to-shopper assignment with a Deep Double Q-Network
(DDQN) for dynamic pricing. This joint optimization strategy enables multi-drop
routing and accounts for offer acceptance uncertainty, aligning more closely
with real-world operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the
integrated NeurADP + DDQN policy achieves notable improvements in delivery cost
efficiency, with up to 6.7\% savings over NeurADP with fixed pricing and
approximately 18\% over myopic baselines. We also show that allowing flexible
delivery delays and enabling multi-destination routing further reduces
operational costs by 8\% and 17\%, respectively. These findings underscore the
advantages of dynamic, forward-looking policies in crowd-shipping systems and
offer practical guidance for urban logistics operators.

### [11] [Refining Gelfond Rationality Principle Towards More Comprehensive Foundational Principles for Answer Set Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01833)
*Yi-Dong Shen,Thomas Eiter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了非单调逻辑编程中答案集语义的一般原则，提出并细化了Gelfond答案集（GAS）原则，定义了新的语义，并分析了计算复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否应将最小模型属性、约束单调性和基础性作为答案集语义的强制条件，以及探索其他可能的通用原则。

Method: 通过例子说明现有条件的局限性，细化GAS原则为良好支持性、默认否定的极小性和认知否定的极小性，并基于此定义新语义。

Result: 提出新的答案集语义，并验证其合理性；计算复杂性分析表明其可行性。

Conclusion: 细化后的GAS原则为答案集语义提供了更灵活的通用标准，同时保持了逻辑编程的合理性和可计算性。

Abstract: Non-monotonic logic programming is the basis for a declarative problem
solving paradigm known as answer set programming (ASP). Departing from the
seminal definition by Gelfond and Lifschitz in 1988 for simple normal logic
programs, various answer set semantics have been proposed for extensions. We
consider two important questions: (1) Should the minimal model property,
constraint monotonicity and foundedness as defined in the literature be
mandatory conditions for an answer set semantics in general? (2) If not, what
other properties could be considered as general principles for answer set
semantics? We address the two questions. First, it seems that the three
aforementioned conditions may sometimes be too strong, and we illustrate with
examples that enforcing them may exclude expected answer sets. Second, we
evolve the Gelfond answer set (GAS) principles for answer set construction by
refining the Gelfond's rationality principle to well-supportedness, minimality
w.r.t. negation by default and minimality w.r.t. epistemic negation. The
principle of well-supportedness guarantees that every answer set is
constructible from if-then rules obeying a level mapping and is thus free of
circular justification, while the two minimality principles ensure that the
formalism minimizes knowledge both at the level of answer sets and of world
views. Third, to embody the refined GAS principles, we extend the notion of
well-supportedness substantially to answer sets and world views, respectively.
Fourth, we define new answer set semantics in terms of the refined GAS
principles. Fifth, we use the refined GAS principles as an alternative baseline
to intuitively assess the existing answer set semantics. Finally, we analyze
the computational complexity.

### [12] [MALIBU Benchmark: Multi-Agent LLM Implicit Bias Uncovered](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01019)
*Imran Mirza,Cole Huang,Ishwara Vasista,Rohan Patil,Asli Akalin,Sean O'Brien,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MALIBU是一个新基准，用于评估基于LLM的多智能体系统中隐含的社会偏见和刻板印象。通过场景化评估，研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体，而非真正中立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统可能强化LLM中的隐含偏见，引发公平和代表性担忧，需开发评估工具。

Method: MALIBU通过两阶段评估：1) 对标注特定人口特征的响应评分；2) 比较不同人口特征的响应并选择更优者。

Result: 研究发现偏见缓解可能偏向边缘化群体，而非真正中立。

Conclusion: 需更细致的偏见检测、平衡的公平策略和透明的评估基准。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems, which consist of multiple AI models interacting within a
shared environment, are increasingly used for persona-based interactions.
However, if not carefully designed, these systems can reinforce implicit biases
in large language models (LLMs), raising concerns about fairness and equitable
representation. We present MALIBU, a novel benchmark developed to assess the
degree to which LLM-based multi-agent systems implicitly reinforce social
biases and stereotypes. MALIBU evaluates bias in LLM-based multi-agent systems
through scenario-based assessments. AI models complete tasks within predefined
contexts, and their responses undergo evaluation by an LLM-based multi-agent
judging system in two phases. In the first phase, judges score responses
labeled with specific demographic personas (e.g., gender, race, religion)
across four metrics. In the second phase, judges compare paired responses
assigned to different personas, scoring them and selecting the superior
response. Our study quantifies biases in LLM-generated outputs, revealing that
bias mitigation may favor marginalized personas over true neutrality,
emphasizing the need for nuanced detection, balanced fairness strategies, and
transparent evaluation benchmarks in multi-agent systems.

### [13] [Event-based evaluation of abstractive news summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01160)
*Huiling You,Samia Touileb,Erik Velldal,Lilja Øvrelid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过事件重叠评估生成摘要质量的方法，使用挪威语数据集验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摘要评估依赖人工参考摘要的相似性，但忽略了事件信息的完整性。本文旨在通过事件重叠更全面地评估摘要质量。

Method: 计算生成摘要、参考摘要和原文之间的事件重叠，使用挪威语数据集进行实验。

Result: 方法能更深入分析摘要中的事件信息，提供更全面的评估视角。

Conclusion: 事件重叠是一种有效的摘要评估方法，能更准确地反映摘要质量。

Abstract: An abstractive summary of a news article contains its most important
information in a condensed version. The evaluation of automatically generated
summaries by generative language models relies heavily on human-authored
summaries as gold references, by calculating overlapping units or similarity
scores. News articles report events, and ideally so should the summaries. In
this work, we propose to evaluate the quality of abstractive summaries by
calculating overlapping events between generated summaries, reference
summaries, and the original news articles. We experiment on a richly annotated
Norwegian dataset comprising both events annotations and summaries authored by
expert human annotators. Our approach provides more insight into the event
information contained in the summaries.

### [14] [Matching and Linking Entries in Historical Swedish Encyclopedias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01170)
*Simon Börjesson,Erik Ersmark,Pierre Nugues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了瑞典百科全书《Nordisk familjebok》第一版和第二版中地理条目的变化，发现从欧洲转向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧的显著地理趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是通过数字化版本分析百科全书条目内容的变化，反映瑞典社会在19世纪末至20世纪初的知识变迁。

Method: 使用语义句子嵌入匹配条目，基于Transformer分类器提取地理条目，并与Wikidata链接，以识别地理趋势。

Result: 发现从第一版到第二版，地理焦点从欧洲转向北美、非洲、亚洲、澳大利亚和北欧，反映了第一次世界大战和新势力崛起的影响。

Conclusion: 研究验证了百科全书内容变化与社会历史背景的关联，数据和方法公开可用。

Abstract: The \textit{Nordisk familjebok} is a Swedish encyclopedia from the 19th and
20th centuries. It was written by a team of experts and aimed to be an
intellectual reference, stressing precision and accuracy. This encyclopedia had
four main editions remarkable by their size, ranging from 20 to 38 volumes. As
a consequence, the \textit{Nordisk familjebok} had a considerable influence in
universities, schools, the media, and society overall. As new editions were
released, the selection of entries and their content evolved, reflecting
intellectual changes in Sweden.
  In this paper, we used digitized versions from \textit{Project Runeberg}. We
first resegmented the raw text into entries and matched pairs of entries
between the first and second editions using semantic sentence embeddings. We
then extracted the geographical entries from both editions using a
transformer-based classifier and linked them to Wikidata. This enabled us to
identify geographic trends and possible shifts between the first and second
editions, written between 1876-1899 and 1904-1926, respectively.
  Interpreting the results, we observe a small but significant shift in
geographic focus away from Europe and towards North America, Africa, Asia,
Australia, and northern Scandinavia from the first to the second edition,
confirming the influence of the First World War and the rise of new powers. The
code and data are available on GitHub at

Method: 结合双向mLSTM架构与部分翻转反向流（PF-mLSTM），并引入多头交叉指数门控融合机制（MECGAF）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，MEGA表现优于现有最优方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: MEGA框架有效解决了ABSA任务中的局部与全局依赖建模问题，同时提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a critical Natural Language
Processing (NLP) task that extracts aspects from text and determines their
associated sentiments, enabling fine-grained analysis of user opinions.
Existing ABSA methods struggle to balance computational efficiency with high
performance: deep learning models often lack global context, transformers
demand significant computational resources, and Mamba-based approaches face
CUDA dependency and diminished local correlations. Recent advancements in
Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) models, particularly their efficient
modeling of long-range dependencies, have significantly advanced the NLP
community. However, their potential in ABSA remains untapped. To this end, we
propose xLSTM with Multihead Exponential Gated Fusion (MEGA), a novel framework
integrating a bi-directional mLSTM architecture with forward and partially
flipped backward (PF-mLSTM) streams. The PF-mLSTM enhances localized context
modeling by processing the initial sequence segment in reverse with dedicated
parameters, preserving critical short-range patterns. We further introduce an
mLSTM-based multihead cross exponential gated fusion mechanism (MECGAF) that
dynamically combines forward mLSTM outputs as query and key with PF-mLSTM
outputs as value, optimizing short-range dependency capture while maintaining
global context and efficiency. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MEGA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
superior accuracy and efficiency in ABSA tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去偏算法，通过从编码器表示中移除观察到的混杂因素信息，显著减少了文本嵌入中的偏差，且计算成本低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本序列的嵌入相似性度量可能受到无关属性（如文本来源或语言）的干扰，影响多语料库文本池化等应用。

Method: 采用去偏算法，从编码器表示中移除混杂因素信息。

Result: 在所有评估的嵌入变体和任务中，文档相似性和聚类指标均显著提升，且不影响分布外基准性能。

Conclusion: 去偏算法有效减少了嵌入偏差，且未损害其他性能。

Abstract: Embedding-based similarity metrics between text sequences can be influenced
not just by the content dimensions we most care about, but can also be biased
by spurious attributes like the text's source or language. These document
confounders cause problems for many applications, but especially those that
need to pool texts from different corpora. This paper shows that a debiasing
algorithm that removes information about observed confounders from the encoder
representations substantially reduces these biases at a minimal computational
cost. Document similarity and clustering metrics improve across every embedding
variant and task we evaluate -- often dramatically. Interestingly, performance
on out-of-distribution benchmarks is not impacted, indicating that the
embeddings are not otherwise degraded.

Abstract: In this paper we discuss the capability of large language models to base
their answer and provide proper references when dealing with legal matters of
non-english and non-chinese speaking country. We discuss the history of legal
information retrieval, the difference between case law and statute law, its
impact on the legal tasks and analyze the latest research in this field. Basing
on that background we introduce gAIus, the architecture of the cognitive
LLM-based agent, whose responses are based on the knowledge retrieved from
certain legal act, which is Polish Civil Code. We propose a retrieval mechanism
which is more explainable, human-friendly and achieves better results than
embedding-based approaches. To evaluate our method we create special dataset
based on single-choice questions from entrance exams for law apprenticeships
conducted in Poland. The proposed architecture critically leveraged the
abilities of used large language models, improving the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 by
419%, allowing it to beat gpt-4o and lifting gpt-4o-mini score from 31% to 86%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型（LLMs）在眼科中的实用性，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变和青光眼的筛查中。

Method: 使用300张标注的视网膜眼底照片，通过结构化提示描述图像，评估GPT-4的分类和推荐能力。

Result: GPT-4在DR筛查中表现中等（准确率82.3%），但在青光眼筛查中表现差（准确率约78%）。元数据对结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: GPT-4可模拟基本眼科决策，但不适合临床使用，可能用于教育或文档工作。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can simulate clinical reasoning based on natural
language prompts, but their utility in ophthalmology is largely unexplored.
This study evaluated GPT-4's ability to interpret structured textual
descriptions of retinal fundus photographs and simulate clinical decisions for
diabetic retinopathy (DR) and glaucoma screening, including the impact of
adding real or synthetic clinical metadata. We conducted a retrospective
diagnostic validation study using 300 annotated fundus images. GPT-4 received
structured prompts describing each image, with or without patient metadata. The
model was tasked with assigning an ICDR severity score, recommending DR
referral, and estimating the cup-to-disc ratio for glaucoma referral.
Performance was evaluated using accuracy, macro and weighted F1 scores, and
Cohen's kappa. McNemar's test and change rate analysis were used to assess the
influence of metadata. GPT-4 showed moderate performance for ICDR
classification (accuracy 67.5%, macro F1 0.33, weighted F1 0.67, kappa 0.25),
driven mainly by correct identification of normal cases. Performance improved
in the binary DR referral task (accuracy 82.3%, F1 0.54, kappa 0.44). For
glaucoma referral, performance was poor across all settings (accuracy ~78%, F1
<0.04, kappa <0.03). Metadata inclusion did not significantly affect outcomes
(McNemar p > 0.05), and predictions remained consistent across conditions.
GPT-4 can simulate basic ophthalmic decision-making from structured prompts but
lacks precision for complex tasks. While not suitable for clinical use, LLMs
may assist in education, documentation, or image annotation workflows in
ophthalmology.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因内部知识不一致或检索内容噪声导致的生成不可靠问题。

Method: 提出CARE-RAG框架，包括参数感知证据提取、上下文感知证据精炼、冲突驱动总结及QA修复步骤。

Result: 在修订的QA数据集上，CARE-RAG显著优于现有RAG基线，尤其在噪声或冲突证据场景。

Conclusion: CARE-RAG通过冲突感知和证据整合，显著提升了RAG系统的可信度和生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
integrating their parametric knowledge with external retrieved content.
However, knowledge conflicts caused by internal inconsistencies or noisy
retrieved content can severely undermine the generation reliability of RAG
systems.In this work, we argue that LLMs should rethink all evidence, including
both retrieved content and internal knowledge, before generating responses.We
propose CARE-RAG (Conflict-Aware and Reliable Evidence for RAG), a novel
framework that improves trustworthiness through Conflict-Driven Summarization
of all available evidence.CARE-RAG first derives parameter-aware evidence by
comparing parameter records to identify diverse internal perspectives. It then
refines retrieved evidences to produce context-aware evidence, removing
irrelevant or misleading content. To detect and summarize conflicts, we distill
a 3B LLaMA3.2 model to perform conflict-driven summarization, enabling reliable
synthesis across multiple sources.To further ensure evaluation integrity, we
introduce a QA Repair step to correct outdated or ambiguous benchmark
answers.Experiments on revised QA datasets with retrieval data show that
CARE-RAG consistently outperforms strong RAG baselines, especially in scenarios
with noisy or conflicting evidence.

Motivation: 现有RAG在推理密集型任务中表现有限，缺乏与预训练数据广度对齐的网络规模数据存储。

Method: 引入CompactDS，结合内存近似最近邻检索和磁盘精确搜索，实现高效检索。

Result: CompactDS显著提升了多个基准测试的准确率（如MMLU提升10%），并优于复杂代理系统。

Conclusion: CompactDS展示了高质量多样化数据存储的重要性，支持未来检索式AI系统的研究。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited
settings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In
this work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,
reasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We
identify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore
aligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce
CompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high
retrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are
(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a
compact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory
approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances
speed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves
consistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes
(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,
and 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the
importance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,
textbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore
matches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as
recently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining
simplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our
retrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI
systems.

TL;DR: LaRoSA是一种无需额外训练或基于幅值剪枝的激活稀疏化方法，通过层间正交旋转和Top-K选择，显著提升LLM推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在恢复训练耗时或基于幅值剪枝导致稀疏性波动的问题，LaRoSA旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 利用层间正交旋转将输入激活转换为更适合稀疏化的形式，并通过Top-K选择实现稳定稀疏性。

Result: 在LLaMA2-7B上，40%稀疏度下，LaRoSA仅增加0.17困惑度，推理速度提升1.30倍，零样本任务准确率差距缩小至0.54%。

Conclusion: LaRoSA在多种LLM中表现优异，实现了高效稀疏化和稳定加速。

Abstract: Activation sparsity can reduce the computational overhead and memory
transfers during the forward pass of Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
Existing methods face limitations, either demanding time-consuming recovery
training that hinders real-world adoption, or relying on empirical
magnitude-based pruning, which causes fluctuating sparsity and unstable
inference speed-up. This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse
Activation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve
LLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based
pruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input
activations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification. By
employing a Top-K selection approach within the rotated activations, we achieve
consistent model-level sparsity and reliable wall-clock time speed-up. LaRoSA
is effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal
performance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for
LLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a
consistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in
zero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing
TEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.

Conclusion: 人机协同的数据标注方法能显著提升奖励模型性能，展示了现有偏好数据集的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the critical role of reward models (RMs) in reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF), current state-of-the-art open RMs perform poorly on
most existing evaluation benchmarks, failing to capture the spectrum of nuanced
and sophisticated human preferences. Even approaches that incorporate advanced
training techniques have not yielded meaningful performance improvements. We
hypothesize that this brittleness stems primarily from limitations in
preference datasets, which are often narrowly scoped, synthetically labeled, or
lack rigorous quality control. To address these challenges, we present a
large-scale preference dataset comprising 40 million preference pairs, named
SynPref-40M. To enable data curation at scale, we design a human-AI synergistic
two-stage pipeline that leverages the complementary strengths of human
annotation quality and AI scalability. In this pipeline, humans provide
verified annotations, while large language models perform automatic curation
based on human guidance. Training on this preference mixture, we introduce
Skywork-Reward-V2, a suite of eight reward models ranging from 0.6B to 8B
parameters, trained on a carefully curated subset of 26 million preference
pairs from SynPref-40M. We demonstrate that Skywork-Reward-V2 is versatile
across a wide range of capabilities, including alignment with human
preferences, objective correctness, safety, resistance to stylistic biases, and
best-of-N scaling, achieving state-of-the-art performance across seven major
reward model benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the effectiveness of our
approach stems not only from data scale but also from high-quality curation.
The Skywork-Reward-V2 series represents substantial progress in open reward
models, highlighting the untapped potential of existing preference datasets and
demonstrating how human-AI curation synergy can unlock significantly higher
data quality.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and
high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep
learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified
modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The
study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is
used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer
self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and
their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then
applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a
context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational
capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse
information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of
experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter
sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests.
Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The
model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference
levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study
offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical
texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling

TL;DR: LogitSpec提出了一种无需训练、即插即用的检索式推测解码方法，通过利用最后一个token的logit推测后续token，显著提升了LLM推理速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索式推测解码方法依赖匹配范式，难以找到准确匹配的参考token，限制了推理效率和部署灵活性。

Method: LogitSpec分两步生成推测token：(1)利用最后一个token的logit推测下一个token；(2)检索与推测token相关的参考。

Result: 实验表明，LogitSpec在多种文本生成任务中实现了最高2.61倍的加速和每解码步骤3.28个平均接受token。

Conclusion: LogitSpec是一种高效、易部署的推测解码方法，显著提升了LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD), where a small draft model is employed to propose
draft tokens in advance and then the target model validates them in parallel,
has emerged as a promising technique for LLM inference acceleration. Many
endeavors to improve SD are to eliminate the need for a draft model and
generate draft tokens in a retrieval-based manner in order to further alleviate
the drafting overhead and significantly reduce the difficulty in deployment and
applications. However, retrieval-based SD relies on a matching paradigm to
retrieval the most relevant reference as the draft tokens, where these methods
often fail to find matched and accurate draft tokens. To address this
challenge, we propose LogitSpec to effectively expand the retrieval range and
find the most relevant reference as drafts. Our LogitSpec is motivated by the
observation that the logit of the last token can not only predict the next
token, but also speculate the next next token. Specifically, LogitSpec
generates draft tokens in two steps: (1) utilizing the last logit to speculate
the next next token; (2) retrieving relevant reference for both the next token
and the next next token. LogitSpec is training-free and plug-and-play, which
can be easily integrated into existing LLM inference frameworks. Extensive
experiments on a wide range of text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
LogitSpec can achieve up to 2.61 $\times$ speedup and 3.28 mean accepted tokens
per decoding step. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有LLM-based ATS系统缺乏个性化，未考虑目标群体的偏好反馈，导致简化文本未能完全满足其需求。

Method: 扩展了监督微调（SFT）方法，采用DPO技术，结合目标群体的偏好反馈进行后训练，并提出了一个开发个性化ATS系统的流程。

Result: 研究表明，目标群体的主动参与对设计符合人类期望的AI无障碍解决方案至关重要。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化包容性AI系统迈出了一步，强调了目标群体参与的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic text simplification (ATS) aims to enhance language accessibility
for various target groups, particularly persons with intellectual disabilities.
Recent advancements in generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs),
have substantially improved the quality of machine-generated text
simplifications, thereby mitigating information barriers for the target group.
However, existing LLM-based ATS systems do not incorporate preference feedback
on text simplifications during training, resulting in a lack of personalization
tailored to the specific needs of target group representatives.
  In this work, we extend the standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach
for adapting LLM-based ATS models by leveraging a computationally efficient LLM
alignment technique -- direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, we
post-train LLM-based ATS models using human feedback collected from persons
with intellectual disabilities, reflecting their preferences on paired text
simplifications generated by mainstream LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a
pipeline for developing personalized LLM-based ATS systems, encompassing data
collection, model selection, SFT and DPO post-training, and evaluation. Our
findings underscore the necessity of active participation of target group
persons in designing personalized AI accessibility solutions aligned with human
expectations. This work represents a step towards personalizing inclusive AI
systems at the target-group level, incorporating insights not only from text
simplification experts but also from target group persons themselves.

efficient and accurate OOS detection. The first step applies uncertainty
estimation to the output of an in-scope intent detection classifier, which is
currently deployed in a real-world TODS handling tens of thousands of user
interactions daily. The second step then leverages an emerging LLM-based
approach, where a fine-tuned LLM is triggered to make a final decision on
instances with high uncertainty. Unlike prior approaches, our method
effectively balances computational efficiency and performance, combining
traditional approaches with LLMs and yielding state-of-the-art results on key
OOS detection benchmarks, including real-world OOS data acquired from a
deployed TODS.

### [30] [Is External Information Useful for Stance Detection with LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01543)
*Quang Minh Nguyen,Taegyoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，外部信息（如维基百科和网络搜索）在大多数情况下会降低大型语言模型（LLM）在立场检测任务中的性能，导致F1分数下降高达27.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨外部信息是否对LLM在立场检测任务中有益，尽管此前研究表明其对BERT等模型有提升作用。

Method: 系统评估了维基百科和网络搜索外部信息对8种LLM在3个数据集（12个目标）上的影响，并分析了LLM的预测倾向。

Result: 外部信息导致性能下降，LLM倾向于与提供信息的立场和情感对齐，而非文本的真实立场。微调可缓解但未完全消除问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在立场检测中的信息偏见风险，与BERT类模型的结论相反。

Abstract: In the stance detection task, a text is classified as either favorable,
opposing, or neutral towards a target. Prior work suggests that the use of
external information, e.g., excerpts from Wikipedia, improves stance detection
performance. However, whether or not such information can benefit large
language models (LLMs) remains an unanswered question, despite their wide
adoption in many reasoning tasks. In this study, we conduct a systematic
evaluation on how Wikipedia and web search external information can affect
stance detection across eight LLMs and in three datasets with 12 targets.
Surprisingly, we find that such information degrades performance in most cases,
with macro F1 scores dropping by up to 27.9\%. We explain this through
experiments showing LLMs' tendency to align their predictions with the stance
and sentiment of the provided information rather than the ground truth stance
of the given text. We also find that performance degradation persists with
chain-of-thought prompting, while fine-tuning mitigates but does not fully
eliminate it. Our findings, in contrast to previous literature on BERT-based
systems which suggests that external information enhances performance,
highlight the risks of information biases in LLM-based stance classifiers. Code

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的任务导向对话系统LUSTER，通过端到端强化学习优化任务成功和情感响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在语言流畅性和上下文理解上有显著进步，但构建高效且情感智能的任务导向对话系统仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出LUSTER系统，结合LLM能力和结构化奖励模型，通过短长期奖励（用户情感和任务成功）进行端到端强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，结合LLM与结构化奖励模型能提升系统的鲁棒性和情感响应能力。

Conclusion: LUSTER为下一代对话系统提供了一种实用路径。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve
specific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in
large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and
contextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD
systems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for
task success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise
information conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous
conversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,
representational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD
systems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a
challenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user
simulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We
propose \textbf{LUSTER}, an \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{U}nified \textbf{S}ystem
for \textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \textbf{E}nd-to-end
\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and
long-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM
capability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and
emotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for
next-generation conversational agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着高性能指令调优神经语言模型的出现，NLP评估从传统全局评分转向成对比较排行榜。本文旨在比较两种方法的优劣，为模型评估策略选择提供依据。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据集的计算实验，使用标准全局指标和Bradley-Terry模型进行成对比较。

Result: 全局评分提供更可靠的总体排名，但可能低估某些模型；成对比较能识别低分模型中的强者，但在频繁平局时收敛较慢。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优劣，选择评估策略需根据具体需求权衡。代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: With the advent of highly capable instruction-tuned neural language models,
benchmarking in natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly shifting
towards pairwise comparison leaderboards, such as LMSYS Arena, from traditional
global pointwise scores (e.g., GLUE, BIG-bench, SWE-bench). This paper
empirically investigates the strengths and weaknesses of both global scores and
pairwise comparisons to aid decision-making in selecting appropriate model
evaluation strategies. Through computational experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets using standard global metrics and the popular Bradley-Terry
model for pairwise comparisons, we found that while global scores provide more
reliable overall rankings, they can underestimate strong models with rare,
significant errors or low confidence. Conversely, pairwise comparisons are
particularly effective for identifying strong contenders among models with
lower global scores, especially where quality metrics are hard to define (e.g.,
text generation), though they require more comparisons to converge if ties are
frequent. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 研究了预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言情感分析任务中的迁移能力，评估了零样本和适配器迁移的性能，发现模型性能与语言在预训练中的曝光程度密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练语言模型在低资源印尼本地语言中的迁移效果，尤其是零样本和适配器迁移的性能表现。

Method: 使用印尼单语BERT、多语言模型（mBERT、XLM-R）和适配器方法MAD-X，将目标语言分为三类（已见、部分见、未见），评估其情感分析性能。

Result: 多语言模型在已见语言中表现最佳，部分见次之，未见最差；MAD-X显著提升性能，尤其是已见和部分见语言。

Conclusion: 模型在预训练中对语言的曝光程度是迁移成功的最一致预测因素，适配器方法MAD-X能有效提升性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transferability of pre-trained language
models to low-resource Indonesian local languages through the task of sentiment
analysis. We evaluate both zero-shot performance and adapter-based transfer on
ten local languages using models of different types: a monolingual Indonesian
BERT, multilingual models such as mBERT and XLM-R, and a modular adapter-based
approach called MAD-X. To better understand model behavior, we group the target
languages into three categories: seen (included during pre-training), partially
seen (not included but linguistically related to seen languages), and unseen
(absent and unrelated in pre-training data). Our results reveal clear
performance disparities across these groups: multilingual models perform best
on seen languages, moderately on partially seen ones, and poorly on unseen
languages. We find that MAD-X significantly improves performance, especially
for seen and partially seen languages, without requiring labeled data in the
target language. Additionally, we conduct a further analysis on tokenization
and show that while subword fragmentation and vocabulary overlap with
Indonesian correlate weakly with prediction quality, they do not fully explain
the observed performance. Instead, the most consistent predictor of transfer
success is the model's prior exposure to the language, either directly or
through a related language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于静态数据集的评估方法无法适应模因动态演变的特性，需更灵活、全面的评估框架。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，动态更新挑战性模因数据，系统评估mLLMs的推理能力。

Result: 实验显示AdamMeme能深入揭示不同mLLMs的性能差异及模型特定弱点。

Conclusion: AdamMeme为mLLMs在有害模因理解上的评估提供了动态、全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal memes in the social media era demands that
multimodal Large Language Models (mLLMs) effectively understand meme
harmfulness. Existing benchmarks for assessing mLLMs on harmful meme
understanding rely on accuracy-based, model-agnostic evaluations using static
datasets. These benchmarks are limited in their ability to provide up-to-date
and thorough assessments, as online memes evolve dynamically. To address this,
we propose AdamMeme, a flexible, agent-based evaluation framework that
adaptively probes the reasoning capabilities of mLLMs in deciphering meme
harmfulness. Through multi-agent collaboration, AdamMeme provides comprehensive
evaluations by iteratively updating the meme data with challenging samples,
thereby exposing specific limitations in how mLLMs interpret harmfulness.
Extensive experiments show that our framework systematically reveals the
varying performance of different target mLLMs, offering in-depth, fine-grained
analyses of model-specific weaknesses. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出StereoBias数据集，通过联合学习偏见和刻板印象检测任务提升模型性能，实验表明联合训练显著优于单独训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型中的偏见和刻板印象可能对敏感领域（如内容审核和决策）造成危害，因此需要有效检测方法。

Method: 引入StereoBias数据集，比较编码器模型和微调解码器模型（使用QLoRA），并研究联合训练偏见与刻板印象检测的效果。

Result: 联合训练显著提升偏见检测性能，且实验证明改进源于偏见与刻板印象的关联，而非多任务学习本身。

Conclusion: 利用刻板印象信息有助于构建更公平有效的AI系统。

Abstract: Bias and stereotypes in language models can cause harm, especially in
sensitive areas like content moderation and decision-making. This paper
addresses bias and stereotype detection by exploring how jointly learning these
tasks enhances model performance. We introduce StereoBias, a unique dataset
labeled for bias and stereotype detection across five categories: religion,
gender, socio-economic status, race, profession, and others, enabling a deeper
study of their relationship. Our experiments compare encoder-only models and
fine-tuned decoder-only models using QLoRA. While encoder-only models perform
well, decoder-only models also show competitive results. Crucially, joint
training on bias and stereotype detection significantly improves bias detection
compared to training them separately. Additional experiments with sentiment
analysis confirm that the improvements stem from the connection between bias
and stereotypes, not multi-task learning alone. These findings highlight the
value of leveraging stereotype information to build fairer and more effective
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律工作的文本密集性和资源密集性为NLP研究提供了独特挑战与机遇，但现有数据驱动方法缺乏可解释性和可信度，限制了其在动态法律环境中的应用。

Method: 与法律专家合作扩展数据集，利用LLM和上下文学习评估合同条款的合法性，比较不同法律上下文（无上下文、全文法律来源、提炼版指南）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 全文法律来源略微提升性能，而提炼版指南显著提高了无效条款的召回率和加权F1分数（达80%），但LLM表现仍远低于人类律师。

Conclusion: LLM在合同合法性审查中具有辅助律师的潜力，但现有方法仍有局限性，贡献包括扩展数据集、法律来源和代码。

Abstract: Legal work, characterized by its text-heavy and resource-intensive nature,
presents unique challenges and opportunities for NLP research. While
data-driven approaches have advanced the field, their lack of interpretability
and trustworthiness limits their applicability in dynamic legal environments.
To address these issues, we collaborated with legal experts to extend an
existing dataset and explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and
in-context learning to evaluate the legality of clauses in German employment
contracts. Our work evaluates the ability of different LLMs to classify clauses
as "valid," "unfair," or "void" under three legal context variants: no legal
context, full-text sources of laws and court rulings, and distilled versions of
these (referred to as examination guidelines). Results show that full-text
sources moderately improve performance, while examination guidelines
significantly enhance recall for void clauses and weighted F1-Score, reaching
80\%. Despite these advancements, LLMs' performance when using full-text
sources remains substantially below that of human lawyers. We contribute an
extended dataset, including examination guidelines, referenced legal sources,
and corresponding annotations, alongside our code and all log files. Our
findings highlight the potential of LLMs to assist lawyers in contract legality
review while also underscoring the limitations of the methods presented.

Result: 研究发现，对数字文本数据的语言和技术细节的深入理解是提升语料库分析准确性的关键。

Conclusion: 研究强调了预处理的重要性，对基于语料库的定量和定性研究具有重要启示。

Abstract: Tokenisation - "the process of splitting text into atomic parts" (Brezina &
Timperley, 2017: 1) - is a crucial step for corpus linguistics, as it provides
the basis for any applicable quantitative method (e.g. collocations) while
ensuring the reliability of qualitative approaches. This paper examines how
discrepancies in tokenisation affect the representation of language data and
the validity of analytical findings: investigating the challenges posed by
emojis and homoglyphs, the study highlights the necessity of preprocessing
these elements to maintain corpus fidelity to the source data. The research
presents methods for ensuring that digital texts are accurately represented in
corpora, thereby supporting reliable linguistic analysis and guaranteeing the
repeatability of linguistic interpretations. The findings emphasise the
necessity of a detailed understanding of both linguistic and technical aspects
involved in digital textual data to enhance the accuracy of corpus analysis,
and have significant implications for both quantitative and qualitative
approaches in corpus-based research.

Conclusion: MuRating为多语言数据质量评估提供了有效解决方案，并指出了未来在翻译保真度和叙事材料代表性方面的改进方向。

Abstract: Data quality is a critical driver of large language model performance, yet
existing model-based selection methods focus almost exclusively on English. We
introduce MuRating, a scalable framework that transfers high-quality English
data-quality signals into a single rater for 17 target languages. MuRating
aggregates multiple English "raters" via pairwise comparisons to learn unified
document-quality scores,then projects these judgments through translation to
train a multilingual evaluator on monolingual, cross-lingual, and parallel text
pairs. Applied to web data, MuRating selects balanced subsets of English and
multilingual content to pretrain a 1.2 B-parameter LLaMA model. Compared to
strong baselines, including QuRater, AskLLM, DCLM and so on, our approach
boosts average accuracy on both English benchmarks and multilingual
evaluations, with especially large gains on knowledge-intensive tasks. We
further analyze translation fidelity, selection biases, and underrepresentation
of narrative material, outlining directions for future work.

Conclusion: 需确保评估的可信度，理解模型的欺骗能力，未来可结合模型内部信息支持黑盒安全审计。

Abstract: Language models can distinguish between testing and deployment phases -- a
capability known as evaluation awareness. This has significant safety and
policy implications, potentially undermining the reliability of evaluations
that are central to AI governance frameworks and voluntary industry
commitments. In this paper, we study evaluation awareness in
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. We show that linear probes can separate real-world
evaluation and deployment prompts, suggesting that current models internally
represent this distinction. We also find that current safety evaluations are
correctly classified by the probes, suggesting that they already appear
artificial or inauthentic to models. Our findings underscore the importance of
ensuring trustworthy evaluations and understanding deceptive capabilities. More
broadly, our work showcases how model internals may be leveraged to support
blackbox methods in safety audits, especially for future models more competent
at evaluation awareness and deception.

Motivation: 理解多模态模型如何处理冲突输入，以提升其鲁棒性和可控性。

Method: 通过提供不一致的视觉-语言输入（如图片与标题矛盾），测试模型对不同模态的偏好，并分析内部结构和注意力机制。

Result: 模型通常偏好某一模态，且可通过调整注意力机制改变偏好；发现模态无关的“路由头”可提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为识别和控制多模态模型中的冲突信号提供了关键步骤。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly required to be multimodal, integrating disparate
input streams into a coherent state representation on which subsequent
behaviors and actions can be based. This paper seeks to understand how such
models behave when input streams present conflicting information. Focusing
specifically on vision-language models, we provide inconsistent inputs (e.g.,
an image of a dog paired with the caption "A photo of a cat") and ask the model
to report the information present in one of the specific modalities (e.g.,
"What does the caption say / What is in the image?"). We find that models often
favor one modality over the other, e.g., reporting the image regardless of what
the caption says, but that different models differ in which modality they
favor. We find evidence that the behaviorally preferred modality is evident in
the internal representational structure of the model, and that specific
attention heads can restructure the representations to favor one modality over
the other. Moreover, we find modality-agnostic "router heads" which appear to
promote answers about the modality requested in the instruction, and which can
be manipulated or transferred in order to improve performance across datasets
and modalities. Together, the work provides essential steps towards identifying
and controlling if and how models detect and resolve conflicting signals within
complex multimodal environments.

Conclusion: 提出了匹配度衡量标准，并为开发可解释医疗编码系统提供了建议。

Abstract: Automatic medical coding has the potential to ease documentation and billing
processes. For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical
coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability
methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to
short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent
efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which
provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In
this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform
plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an
applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of
automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that
ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An
investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground
truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure
cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and
evaluating explainable medical coding systems.

Conclusion: JSON是临床笔记解析的最佳选择，提示设计和模型大小是关键因素。

Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs
generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from

Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but
declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis
identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer
practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts
when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings.

Result: 发现大量低困惑度序列无法映射到训练数据，匹配序列的分布揭示了LLMs的逐字回忆行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解LLMs训练数据对其行为的影响提供了新途径。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly widespread, understanding
how specific training data shapes their outputs is crucial for transparency,
accountability, privacy, and fairness. To explore how LLMs leverage and
replicate their training data, we introduce a systematic approach centered on
analyzing low-perplexity sequences - high-probability text spans generated by
the model. Our pipeline reliably extracts such long sequences across diverse
topics while avoiding degeneration, then traces them back to their sources in
the training data. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial portion of these
low-perplexity spans cannot be mapped to the corpus. For those that do match,
we quantify the distribution of occurrences across source documents,
highlighting the scope and nature of verbatim recall and paving a way toward
better understanding of how LLMs training data impacts their behavior.

*Kenan Tang,Yanhong Li,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIY-MKG是一个开源系统，支持多语言学习，通过个性化词汇知识图谱和LLM驱动的动态测验生成，解决了现有语言学习工具的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言学习工具缺乏多语言词汇连接支持、个性化定制不足，且存在认知卸载问题。

Method: 设计DIY-MKG系统，利用LLM构建个性化词汇知识图谱，提供丰富注释和自适应复习模块。

Result: 评估显示词汇扩展可靠且公平，生成的测验高度准确。

Conclusion: DIY-MKG有效解决了现有工具的不足，验证了其稳健性。

Abstract: Existing language learning tools, even those powered by Large Language Models
(LLMs), often lack support for polyglot learners to build linguistic
connections across vocabularies in multiple languages, provide limited
customization for individual learning paces or needs, and suffer from
detrimental cognitive offloading. To address these limitations, we design
Do-It-Yourself Multilingual Knowledge Graph (DIY-MKG), an open-source system
that supports polyglot language learning. DIY-MKG allows the user to build
personalized vocabulary knowledge graphs, which are constructed by selective
expansion with related words suggested by an LLM. The system further enhances
learning through rich annotation capabilities and an adaptive review module
that leverages LLMs for dynamic, personalized quiz generation. In addition,
DIY-MKG allows users to flag incorrect quiz questions, simultaneously
increasing user engagement and providing a feedback loop for prompt refinement.
Our evaluation of LLM-based components in DIY-MKG shows that vocabulary
expansion is reliable and fair across multiple languages, and that the
generated quizzes are highly accurate, validating the robustness of DIY-MKG.

*Dongyi Ding,Tiannan Wang,Chenghao Zhu,Meiling Tao,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiCoTA框架通过中间模型和中等长度推理序列，提升小语言模型的长推理能力，实验显示显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小语言模型（SLMs）因容量有限难以学习长推理序列的问题，即“SLMs Learnability Gap”。

Method: 引入MiCoTA框架，利用中间模型作为教师助手，结合中等长度推理序列，弥合容量和推理长度差距。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B和Qwen2.5-3B模型在多个基准测试中平均得分分别提升3.47和3.93。

Conclusion: MiCoTA通过优化数据分布，显著提升SLMs的长推理能力，为未来研究提供方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks requiring long thought
sequences for planning, reflection, and refinement. However, their substantial
model size and high computational demands are impractical for widespread
deployment. Yet, small language models (SLMs) often struggle to learn long-form
CoT reasoning due to their limited capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as the
"SLMs Learnability Gap". To address this, we introduce
\textbf{Mi}d-\textbf{Co}T \textbf{T}eacher \textbf{A}ssistant Distillation
(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA
employs intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes
intermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning
length gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs
distilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they
achieve significant improvements in reasoning performance. Specifically,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct achieve an improvement of 3.47 and
3.93 respectively on average score on AIME2024, AMC, Olympiad, MATH-500 and
GSM8K benchmarks. To better understand the mechanism behind MiCoTA, we perform
a quantitative experiment demonstrating that our method produces data more
closely aligned with base SLM distributions. Our insights pave the way for
future research into long-CoT data distillation for SLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的剪枝算法，针对大语言模型的高层注意力头进行策略性剪枝，并通过自适应重缩放参数校准表示尺度，显著提升了生成任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统剪枝方法不考虑注意力头在网络架构中的位置，导致性能下降。本文旨在通过策略性剪枝和校准表示尺度来优化剪枝效果。

Method: 提出了一种剪枝算法，专注于高层注意力头的剪枝，并引入自适应重缩放参数以校准剪枝后的表示尺度。

Result: 在多个大语言模型和27个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在生成任务中显著优于现有剪枝方法。

Conclusion: 策略性剪枝和自适应重缩放参数能有效提升剪枝后模型的性能，尤其在生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Pruning is a highly effective approach for compressing large language models
(LLMs), significantly reducing inference latency. However, conventional
training-free structured pruning methods often employ a heuristic metric that
indiscriminately removes some attention heads across all pruning layers,
without considering their positions within the network architecture. In this
work, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention
heads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can
alter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive
rescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to
counteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
LLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B. Our
evaluation includes both generation and discriminative tasks across 27
datasets. The results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing structured pruning methods. This improvement is particularly notable
in generation tasks, where our approach significantly outperforms existing
baselines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large
language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in complex domains such as logical reasoning and
experimental coding. Motivated by these advancements, numerous studies have
explored the application of AI in the innovation process, particularly in the
context of scientific research. These AI technologies primarily aim to develop
systems that can autonomously conduct research processes across a wide range of
scientific disciplines. Despite these significant strides, a comprehensive
survey on AI for Research (AI4Research) remains absent, which hampers our
understanding and impedes further development in this field. To address this
gap, we present a comprehensive survey and offer a unified perspective on
AI4Research. Specifically, the main contributions of our work are as follows:
(1) Systematic taxonomy: We first introduce a systematic taxonomy to classify
five mainstream tasks in AI4Research. (2) New frontiers: Then, we identify key
research gaps and highlight promising future directions, focusing on the rigor
and scalability of automated experiments, as well as the societal impact. (3)
Abundant applications and resources: Finally, we compile a wealth of resources,
including relevant multidisciplinary applications, data corpora, and tools. We
hope our work will provide the research community with quick access to these
resources and stimulate innovative breakthroughs in AI4Research.

TL;DR: 论文提出GAPO方法，通过多梯度下降优化LLM与多样化人类偏好的对齐，解决冲突目标问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF方法难以有效对齐多样化且可能冲突的人类偏好。

Method: 引入GAPO和P-GAPO，采用多梯度下降自适应调整目标梯度，优化对齐效果。

Result: 理论证明GAPO收敛于帕累托最优解，实验显示其在Mistral-7B上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAPO为多样化偏好对齐提供有效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a powerful
technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, effectively aligning LLMs with diverse human preferences remains a
significant challenge, particularly when they are conflict. To address this
issue, we frame human value alignment as a multi-objective optimization
problem, aiming to maximize a set of potentially conflicting objectives. We
introduce Gradient-Adaptive Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel fine-tuning
paradigm that employs multiple-gradient descent to align LLMs with diverse
preference distributions. GAPO adaptively rescales the gradients for each
objective to determine an update direction that optimally balances the
trade-offs between objectives. Additionally, we introduce P-GAPO, which
incorporates user preferences across different objectives and achieves Pareto
solutions that better align with the user's specific needs. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that GAPO converges towards a Pareto optimal solution for
multiple objectives. Empirical results on Mistral-7B show that GAPO outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both
helpfulness and harmlessness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过从教师模型中蒸馏高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），提升学生模型的推理能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究教师模型的哪种推理示范最有效提升学生模型的推理能力。

Method: 从教师模型中精选高质量推理轨迹（NaturalThoughts），并分析影响推理能力蒸馏的因素。

Result: 选择需要多样化推理策略的困难样本更高效，NaturalThoughts在多个基准测试中优于现有数据集。

Conclusion: NaturalThoughts能有效提升学生模型的推理能力，尤其在多样化推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that distilling reasoning traces from a larger teacher
model via supervised finetuning outperforms reinforcement learning with the
smaller student model alone (Guo et al. 2025). However, there has not been a
systematic study of what kind of reasoning demonstrations from the teacher are
most effective in improving the student model's reasoning capabilities. In this
work we curate high-quality "NaturalThoughts" by selecting reasoning traces
from a strong teacher model based on a large pool of questions from
NaturalReasoning (Yuan et al. 2025). We first conduct a systematic analysis of
factors that affect distilling reasoning capabilities, in terms of sample
efficiency and scalability for general reasoning tasks. We observe that simply
scaling up data size with random sampling is a strong baseline with steady
performance gains. Further, we find that selecting difficult examples that
require more diverse reasoning strategies is more sample-efficient to transfer
the teacher model's reasoning skills. Evaluated on both Llama and Qwen models,
training with NaturalThoughts outperforms existing reasoning datasets such as
OpenThoughts, LIMO, etc. on general STEM reasoning benchmarks including
GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro and SuperGPQA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于决策效果的NLG评估框架，通过衡量生成文本对人类和LLM决策结果的影响，发现传统评估指标与实际决策效果相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLG评估方法（如n-gram重叠或句子合理性）与实际决策效果相关性低，需开发更有效的评估框架。

Method: 使用市场摘要文本（客观晨报和主观收盘分析）作为测试案例，评估人类和LLM代理在仅依赖这些文本时的交易决策质量。

Result: 人类和LLM代理在仅依赖摘要时表现不优于随机，但更丰富的分析评论能显著提升人类-LLM团队的协同决策效果。

Conclusion: 强调评估生成文本应关注其促进人类与LLM协同决策的能力，传统内在指标存在局限性。

Abstract: Natural language generation (NLG) is increasingly deployed in high-stakes
domains, yet common intrinsic evaluation methods, such as n-gram overlap or
sentence plausibility, weakly correlate with actual decision-making efficacy.
We propose a decision-oriented framework for evaluating generated text by
directly measuring its influence on human and large language model (LLM)
decision outcomes. Using market digest texts--including objective morning
summaries and subjective closing-bell analyses--as test cases, we assess
decision quality based on the financial performance of trades executed by human
investors and autonomous LLM agents informed exclusively by these texts. Our
findings reveal that neither humans nor LLM agents consistently surpass random
performance when relying solely on summaries. However, richer analytical
commentaries enable collaborative human-LLM teams to outperform individual
human or agent baselines significantly. Our approach underscores the importance
of evaluating generated text by its ability to facilitate synergistic
decision-making between humans and LLMs, highlighting critical limitations of
traditional intrinsic metrics.

TL;DR: LLMs能进行连贯且有说服力的辩论，但缺乏对对话深层结构的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在辩论中的表现及其对对话结构的理解能力。

Method: 通过辩论测试LLMs的能力，并测量其对对话结构和语用背景的理解。

Result: LLMs能进行有说服力的辩论，但无法展示对深层对话结构的理解。

Conclusion: LLMs作为评估者的局限性源于其对上下文理解的不足，辩论能力不依赖于对话题的深层理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are excellent at maintaining high-level,
convincing dialogues. They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators
in sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,
along with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a
closer examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we
begin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet
most complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability
relates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their
comprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that
LLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the
beliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or
suspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the
arguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures
of dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings
tie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand
the context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,
if an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to
know what it is talking about. Hence, the modelling of pragmatic context and
coherence are secondary to effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型注意力机制LASAD，通过保持2D空间关系解决线性注意力在图像生成中的性能问题，并基于此构建了高效的自回归图像生成器LASADGen。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型依赖Transformer架构，存在计算复杂度和内存开销大的问题，而线性注意力机制在图像生成中因无法捕捉长距离依赖导致性能下降。

Method: 提出LASAD注意力机制，通过基于真实2D空间位置的位置相关衰减因子保持空间关系，并构建LASADGen生成器。

Result: 在ImageNet上实验表明，LASADGen在图像生成性能和计算效率上达到最优。

Conclusion: LASADGen成功平衡了线性注意力的高效性与高质量图像生成所需的空间理解能力。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have garnered significant attention in image
generation for their ability to effectively capture both local and global
structures within visual data. However, prevalent AR models predominantly rely
on the transformer architectures, which are beset by quadratic computational
complexity concerning input sequence length and substantial memory overhead due
to the necessity of maintaining key-value caches. Although linear attention
mechanisms have successfully reduced this burden in language models, our
initial experiments reveal that they significantly degrade image generation
quality because of their inability to capture critical long-range dependencies
in visual data. We propose Linear Attention with Spatial-Aware Decay (LASAD), a
novel attention mechanism that explicitly preserves genuine 2D spatial
relationships within the flattened image sequences by computing
position-dependent decay factors based on true 2D spatial location rather than
1D sequence positions. Based on this mechanism, we present LASADGen, an
autoregressive image generator that enables selective attention to relevant
spatial contexts with linear complexity. Experiments on ImageNet show LASADGen
achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance and computational
efficiency, bridging the gap between linear attention's efficiency and spatial
understanding needed for high-quality generation.

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人数据集上生成更稳定、空间对齐的预测视频，并支持机器人末端轨迹恢复。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频生成的几何一致性，支持机器人操作和新视角泛化。

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of the physical world can enhance a
robot's ability to plan and interact effectively in complex environments. While
recent video generation models have shown strong potential in modeling dynamic
scenes, generating videos that are both temporally coherent and geometrically
consistent across camera views remains a significant challenge. To address
this, we propose a 4D video generation model that enforces multi-view 3D
consistency of videos by supervising the model with cross-view pointmap
alignment during training. This geometric supervision enables the model to
learn a shared 3D representation of the scene, allowing it to predict future
video sequences from novel viewpoints based solely on the given RGB-D
observations, without requiring camera poses as inputs. Compared to existing
baselines, our method produces more visually stable and spatially aligned
predictions across multiple simulated and real-world robotic datasets. We
further show that the predicted 4D videos can be used to recover robot
end-effector trajectories using an off-the-shelf 6DoF pose tracker, supporting
robust robot manipulation and generalization to novel camera viewpoints.

Motivation: 现有的答案中心监督方法仅监督最终输出，可能导致模型发展出肤浅的捷径，缺乏对推理路径的监督。

Method: 采用分层浓度窄化监督方法，通过三个阶段逐步聚焦，监督关键检查点以确保合理的推理路径。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效确保模型发展出合理的推理路径并表现更好。

Conclusion: HCNQA通过分层监督解决了现有方法的不足，提升了3D VQA模型的性能。

Abstract: 3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the
physical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a
commonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this
strategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the
answer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows
models to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the
reasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts
through common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although
slow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from
underthinking. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA
model leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By
mimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific
objects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform
three phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By
supervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can
ensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure that
the model develops a rational reasoning pathway and performs better. The code

Abstract: Biological image analysis has traditionally focused on measuring specific

paradigm gaining increasing traction is image-based profiling - quantifying
many distinct visual features to form comprehensive profiles which may reveal
hidden patterns in cellular states, drug responses, and disease mechanisms.
While current tools like CellProfiler can generate these feature sets, they
pose significant barriers to automated and reproducible analyses, hindering
machine learning workflows. Here we introduce cp_measure, a Python library that
extracts CellProfiler's core measurement capabilities into a modular, API-first
tool designed for programmatic feature extraction. We demonstrate that
cp_measure features retain high fidelity with CellProfiler features while
enabling seamless integration with the scientific Python ecosystem. Through
applications to 3D astrocyte imaging and spatial transcriptomics, we showcase
how cp_measure enables reproducible, automated image-based profiling pipelines
that scale effectively for machine learning applications in computational
biology.

Result: 模型SDNet和STDNet在Jetson Orin设备上分别达到46 FPS和150 FPS，速度和精度均优于其他轻量级模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和精度之间取得了显著平衡，适用于资源受限设备的实时SOD任务。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deploying salient object detection
(SOD) on resource-constrained devices with real-time performance. While recent
advances in deep neural networks have improved SOD, existing top-leading models
are computationally expensive. We propose an efficient network design that
combines traditional wisdom on SOD and the representation power of modern CNNs.
Like biologically-inspired classical SOD methods relying on computing contrast
cues to determine saliency of image regions, our model leverages Pixel
Difference Convolutions (PDCs) to encode the feature contrasts. Differently,
PDCs are incorporated in a CNN architecture so that the valuable contrast cues
are extracted from rich feature maps. For efficiency, we introduce a difference
convolution reparameterization (DCR) strategy that embeds PDCs into standard
convolutions, eliminating computation and parameters at inference.
Additionally, we introduce SpatioTemporal Difference Convolution (STDC) for
video SOD, enhancing the standard 3D convolution with spatiotemporal contrast
capture. Our models, SDNet for image SOD and STDNet for video SOD, achieve
significant improvements in efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. On a Jetson Orin
device, our models with $<$ 1M parameters operate at 46 FPS and 150 FPS on
streamed images and videos, surpassing the second-best lightweight models in
our experiments by more than $2\times$ and $3\times$ in speed with superior
accuracy. Code will be available at https://github.com/hellozhuo/stdnet.git.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理模态缺失问题，提升分割准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal MRI provides critical complementary information for accurate brain
tumor segmentation. However, conventional methods struggle when certain
modalities are missing due to issues such as image quality, protocol
inconsistencies, patient allergies, or financial constraints. To address this,
we propose a robust single-modality parallel processing framework that achieves
high segmentation accuracy even with incomplete modalities. Leveraging Holder
divergence and mutual information, our model maintains modality-specific
features while dynamically adjusting network parameters based on the available
inputs. By using these divergence- and information-based loss functions, the
framework effectively quantifies discrepancies between predictions and
ground-truth labels, resulting in consistently accurate segmentation. Extensive
evaluations on the BraTS 2018 and BraTS 2020 datasets demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in handling missing modalities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generated video models has created a pressing
need for robust and interpretable evaluation frameworks. Existing metrics are
limited to producing numerical scores without explanatory comments, resulting
in low interpretability and human evaluation alignment. To address those
challenges, we introduce AIGVE-MACS, a unified model for AI-Generated Video
Evaluation(AIGVE), which can provide not only numerical scores but also
multi-aspect language comment feedback in evaluating these generated videos.
Central to our approach is AIGVE-BENCH 2, a large-scale benchmark comprising
2,500 AI-generated videos and 22,500 human-annotated detailed comments and
numerical scores across nine critical evaluation aspects. Leveraging
AIGVE-BENCH 2, AIGVE-MACS incorporates recent Vision-Language Models with a
novel token-wise weighted loss and a dynamic frame sampling strategy to better
align with human evaluators. Comprehensive experiments across supervised and
zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that AIGVE-MACS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scoring correlation and comment quality, significantly
outperforming prior baselines including GPT-4o and VideoScore. In addition, we
further showcase a multi-agent refinement framework where feedback from
AIGVE-MACS drives iterative improvements in video generation, leading to 53.5%
quality enhancement. This work establishes a new paradigm for comprehensive,
human-aligned evaluation of AI-generated videos. We release the AIGVE-BENCH 2
and AIGVE-MACS at https://huggingface.co/xiaoliux/AIGVE-MACS.

Abstract: Weed mapping plays a critical role in precision management by providing
accurate and timely data on weed distribution, enabling targeted control and
reduced herbicide use. This minimizes environmental impacts, supports
sustainable land management, and improves outcomes across agricultural and
natural environments. Recent advances in weed mapping leverage ground-vehicle
Red Green Blue (RGB) cameras, satellite and drone-based remote sensing combined
with sensors such as spectral, Near Infra-Red (NIR), and thermal cameras. The
resulting data are processed using advanced techniques including big data
analytics and machine learning, significantly improving the spatial and
temporal resolution of weed maps and enabling site-specific management
decisions. Despite a growing body of research in this domain, there is a lack
of comprehensive literature reviews specifically focused on weed mapping. In
particular, the absence of a structured analysis spanning the entire mapping
pipeline, from data acquisition to processing techniques and mapping tools,
limits progress in the field. This review addresses these gaps by
systematically examining state-of-the-art methods in data acquisition (sensor
and platform technologies), data processing (including annotation and
modelling), and mapping techniques (such as spatiotemporal analysis and
decision support tools). Following PRISMA guidelines, we critically evaluate
and synthesize key findings from the literature to provide a holistic
understanding of the weed mapping landscape. This review serves as a
foundational reference to guide future research and support the development of
efficient, scalable, and sustainable weed management systems.

Conclusion: 本文提出的频域扩散模型有效解决了无配对图像去雾问题，通过频域重建和相位优化显著提升了去雾效果。

Abstract: Unpaired image dehazing has attracted increasing attention due to its
flexible data requirements during model training. Dominant methods based on
contrastive learning not only introduce haze-unrelated content information, but
also ignore haze-specific properties in the frequency domain (\ie,~haze-related
degradation is mainly manifested in the amplitude spectrum). To address these
issues, we propose a novel frequency domain-based diffusion model, named \ours,
for fully exploiting the beneficial knowledge in unpaired clear data. In
particular, inspired by the strong generative ability shown by Diffusion Models
(DMs), we tackle the dehazing task from the perspective of frequency domain
reconstruction and perform the DMs to yield the amplitude spectrum consistent
with the distribution of clear images. To implement it, we propose an Amplitude
Residual Encoder (ARE) to extract the amplitude residuals, which effectively
compensates for the amplitude gap from the hazy to clear domains, as well as
provide supervision for the DMs training. In addition, we propose a Phase
Correction Module (PCM) to eliminate artifacts by further refining the phase
spectrum during dehazing with a simple attention mechanism. Experimental
results demonstrate that our \ours outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: ET-Fuser通过集成令牌和注意力机制，高效地提升了面部分析任务的性能。

Abstract: Facial analysis exhibits task-specific feature variations. While
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have enabled the fine-grained
representation of spatial information, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
facilitated the representation of semantic information at the patch level.
Although the generalization of conventional methodologies has advanced visual
interpretability, there remains paucity of research that preserves the unified
feature representation on single task learning during the training process. In
this work, we introduce ET-Fuser, a novel methodology for learning ensemble
token by leveraging attention mechanisms based on task priors derived from
pre-trained models for facial analysis. Specifically, we propose a robust prior
unification learning method that generates a ensemble token within a
self-attention mechanism, which shares the mutual information along the
pre-trained encoders. This ensemble token approach offers high efficiency with
negligible computational cost. Our results show improvements across a variety
of facial analysis, with statistically significant enhancements observed in the
feature representations.

Conclusion: DiffusionLight和DiffusionLight-Turbo提供了一种高效且泛化能力强的光照估计方法，显著提升了速度和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce a simple yet effective technique for estimating lighting from a
single low-dynamic-range (LDR) image by reframing the task as a chrome ball
inpainting problem. This approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model,
Stable Diffusion XL, to overcome the generalization failures of existing
methods that rely on limited HDR panorama datasets. While conceptually simple,
the task remains challenging because diffusion models often insert incorrect or
inconsistent content and cannot readily generate chrome balls in HDR format.
Our analysis reveals that the inpainting process is highly sensitive to the
initial noise in the diffusion process, occasionally resulting in unrealistic
outputs. To address this, we first introduce DiffusionLight, which uses
iterative inpainting to compute a median chrome ball from multiple outputs to
serve as a stable, low-frequency lighting prior that guides the generation of a
high-quality final result. To generate high-dynamic-range (HDR) light probes,
an Exposure LoRA is fine-tuned to create LDR images at multiple exposure
values, which are then merged. While effective, DiffusionLight is
time-intensive, requiring approximately 30 minutes per estimation. To reduce
this overhead, we introduce DiffusionLight-Turbo, which reduces the runtime to
about 30 seconds with minimal quality loss. This 60x speedup is achieved by
training a Turbo LoRA to directly predict the averaged chrome balls from the
iterative process. Inference is further streamlined into a single denoising
pass using a LoRA swapping technique. Experimental results that show our method
produces convincing light estimates across diverse settings and demonstrates
superior generalization to in-the-wild scenarios. Our code is available at

Abstract: Body dynamics are crucial information for the analysis of human motions in
important research fields, ranging from biomechanics, sports science to
computer vision and graphics. Modern approaches collect the body dynamics,
external reactive force specifically, via force plates, synchronizing with
human motion capture data, and learn to estimate the dynamics from a black-box
deep learning model. Being specialized devices, force plates can only be
installed in laboratory setups, imposing a significant limitation on the
learning of human dynamics. To this end, we propose a novel method for
estimating human ground reaction dynamics directly from the more reliable
motion capture data with physics laws and computational simulation as
constrains. We introduce a highly accurate and robust method for computing
ground reaction forces from motion capture data using Euler's integration
scheme and PD algorithm. The physics-based reactive forces are used to inform
the learning model about the physics-informed motion dynamics thus improving
the estimation accuracy. The proposed approach was tested on the GroundLink
dataset, outperforming the baseline model on: 1) the ground reaction force
estimation accuracy compared to the force plates measurement; and 2) our
simulated root trajectory precision. The implementation code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业自动白平衡（AWB）系统通常追求美学偏好而非准确中性校正，且现有方法难以跨相机传感器泛化。

Method: 提出一种后照明估计映射，将中性校正转换为美学校正，模型轻量（约500参数），兼容现有跨相机AWB技术。

Result: 在771张智能手机图像数据集上，方法表现优异，计算速度快（0.024毫秒），兼容性强。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现跨相机美学一致性，轻量高效，兼容现有技术。

Abstract: The image signal processor (ISP) pipeline in modern cameras consists of
several modules that transform raw sensor data into visually pleasing images in
a display color space. Among these, the auto white balance (AWB) module is
essential for compensating for scene illumination. However, commercial AWB
systems often strive to compute aesthetic white-balance preferences rather than
accurate neutral color correction. While learning-based methods have improved
AWB accuracy, they typically struggle to generalize across different camera
sensors -- an issue for smartphones with multiple cameras. Recent work has
explored cross-camera AWB, but most methods remain focused on achieving neutral
white balance. In contrast, this paper is the first to address aesthetic
consistency by learning a post-illuminant-estimation mapping that transforms
neutral illuminant corrections into aesthetically preferred corrections in a
camera-agnostic space. Once trained, our mapping can be applied after any
neutral AWB module to enable consistent and stylized color rendering across
unseen cameras. Our proposed model is lightweight -- containing only $\sim$500
parameters -- and runs in just 0.024 milliseconds on a typical flagship mobile
CPU. Evaluated on a dataset of 771 smartphone images from three different
cameras, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining fully
compatible with existing cross-camera AWB techniques, introducing minimal
computational and memory overhead.

Motivation: 现有测试时增强方法通用性不足，GTTA旨在提供一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过随机扰动PCA子空间投影形成集成，并引入自监督学习阶段优化单模型。

Result: 在多种任务和数据集上验证了GTTA的通用性和有效性，尤其在低能见度水下视频中的三文鱼分割与检测任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: GTTA是一种高效且通用的测试时增强方法，适用于广泛的任务，且在保持精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: We introduce Generalized Test-Time Augmentation (GTTA), a highly effective
method for improving the performance of a trained model, which unlike other
existing Test-Time Augmentation approaches from the literature is general
enough to be used off-the-shelf for many vision and non-vision tasks, such as
classification, regression, image segmentation and object detection. By
applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple
times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA forms robust ensembles
at test time in which, due to sound statistical properties, the structural and
systematic noises in the initial input data is filtered out and final estimator
errors are reduced. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a
final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an
unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus
reducing significantly the test time computational cost, at no loss in
accuracy. Our tests and comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on
various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image
classification and segmentation, speech recognition and house price prediction,
validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its
effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and
detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce
DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.

Motivation: 现有MoE框架在视觉语言模型中忽视了视觉和语言模态间的分布差异，导致路由策略不匹配。

Method: 提出LTDR，针对语言和视觉模态的不同分布（均匀与长尾）设计路由策略，并通过增加视觉尾部令牌的专家激活数来优化性能。

Result: 实验验证了LTDR在多个基准测试中的有效性。

Conclusion: LTDR通过模态感知路由和尾部令牌优化，提升了视觉语言MoE模型的性能。

Abstract: The mixture-of-experts (MoE), which replaces dense models with sparse
architectures, has gained attention in large vision-language models (LVLMs) for
achieving comparable performance with fewer activated parameters. Existing MoE
frameworks for LVLMs focus on token-to-expert routing (TER), encouraging
different experts to specialize in processing distinct tokens. However, these
frameworks often rely on the load balancing mechanism, overlooking the inherent
distributional differences between vision and language. To this end, we propose
a Long-Tailed Distribution-aware Router (LTDR) for vision-language TER,
tackling two challenges: (1) Distribution-aware router for modality-specific
routing. We observe that language TER follows a uniform distribution, whereas
vision TER exhibits a long-tailed distribution. This discrepancy necessitates
distinct routing strategies tailored to each modality. (2) Enhancing expert
activation for vision tail tokens. Recognizing the importance of vision tail
tokens, we introduce an oversampling-like strategy by increasing the number of
activated experts for these tokens. Experiments on extensive benchmarks
validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 物理对抗攻击方法在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶）中暴露了深度神经网络的脆弱性。现有伪装攻击方法依赖模拟环境和网格先验，效率低且与现实世界存在差异，且缺乏多视角鲁棒性。

Method: PGA框架利用3DGS实现快速精确的3D重建和逼真渲染，通过防止高斯间的相互遮挡和自遮挡，以及采用最小-最大优化调整每个视角的背景，提升对抗效果和跨视角鲁棒性。

Result: 实验验证了PGA在对抗效果和鲁棒性上的优越性。

Conclusion: PGA为物理对抗攻击提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂物理环境。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural
networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as
autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising
approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial
effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies
on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by
simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the
real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training
images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial
camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons,
prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse
viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and
precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering
capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and
adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among
Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the
imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out
non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available

Conclusion: Activation RMs是一种高效且适应性强的奖励建模方法，适用于安全关键应用，为模型对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to
human preferences is a central challenge in improving the quality of the
models' generative outputs for real-world applications. A common approach is to
use reward modeling to encode preferences, enabling alignment via post-training
using reinforcement learning. However, traditional reward modeling is not
easily adaptable to new preferences because it requires a separate reward
model, commonly trained on large preference datasets. To address this, we
introduce Activation Reward Models (Activation RMs) -- a novel few-shot reward
modeling method that leverages activation steering to construct well-aligned
reward signals using minimal supervision and no additional model finetuning.
Activation RMs outperform existing few-shot reward modeling approaches such as
LLM-as-a-judge with in-context learning, voting-based scoring, and token
probability scoring on standard reward modeling benchmarks. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of Activation RMs in mitigating reward hacking
behaviors, highlighting their utility for safety-critical applications. Toward
this end, we propose PreferenceHack, a novel few-shot setting benchmark, the
first to test reward models on reward hacking in a paired preference format.
Finally, we show that Activation RM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
this benchmark, surpassing even GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 主动测量框架显著提升了科学测量的效率和准确性，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: AI has the potential to transform scientific discovery by analyzing vast
datasets with little human effort. However, current workflows often do not
provide the accuracy or statistical guarantees that are needed. We introduce
active measurement, a human-in-the-loop AI framework for scientific
measurement. An AI model is used to predict measurements for individual units,
which are then sampled for human labeling using importance sampling. With each
new set of human labels, the AI model is improved and an unbiased Monte Carlo
estimate of the total measurement is refined. Active measurement can provide
precise estimates even with an imperfect AI model, and requires little human
effort when the AI model is very accurate. We derive novel estimators,
weighting schemes, and confidence intervals, and show that active measurement
reduces estimation error compared to alternatives in several measurement tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在弱监督和模型架构的限制下，难以同时提升段级和事件级预测性能。

Method: 通过伪标签增强生成新数据，并采用音频-视觉Mamba网络（AV-Mamba）进行特征处理和交互，以提升模型对不同段落的感知能力并排除模态噪声。

Result: 在LLP数据集上，MUG在所有指标上均优于现有方法（如视觉段级和音频段级指标分别提升2.1%和1.2%）。

Conclusion: MUG通过伪标签增强和AV-Mamba网络，显著提升了弱监督音频-视觉视频解析任务的性能。

Abstract: The weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) aims to predict all
modality-specific events and locate their temporal boundaries. Despite
significant progress, due to the limitations of the weakly-supervised and the
deficiencies of the model architecture, existing methods are lacking in
simultaneously improving both the segment-level prediction and the event-level
prediction. In this work, we propose a audio-visual Mamba network with pseudo
labeling aUGmentation (MUG) for emphasising the uniqueness of each segment and
excluding the noise interference from the alternate modalities. Specifically,
we annotate some of the pseudo-labels based on previous work. Using unimodal
pseudo-labels, we perform cross-modal random combinations to generate new data,
which can enhance the model's ability to parse various segment-level event
combinations. For feature processing and interaction, we employ a audio-visual
mamba network. The AV-Mamba enhances the ability to perceive different segments
and excludes additional modal noise while sharing similar modal information.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MUG improves state-of-the-art
results on LLP dataset in all metrics (e.g,, gains of 2.1% and 1.2% in terms of
visual Segment-level and audio Segment-level metrics). Our code is available at

Conclusion: FixTalk为高质量说话头生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Talking head generation is gaining significant importance across various
domains, with a growing demand for high-quality rendering. However, existing
methods often suffer from identity leakage (IL) and rendering artifacts (RA),
particularly in extreme cases. Through an in-depth analysis of previous
approaches, we identify two key insights: (1) IL arises from identity
information embedded within motion features, and (2) this identity information
can be leveraged to address RA. Building on these findings, this paper
introduces FixTalk, a novel framework designed to simultaneously resolve both
issues for high-quality talking head generation. Firstly, we propose an
Enhanced Motion Indicator (EMI) to effectively decouple identity information
from motion features, mitigating the impact of IL on generated talking heads.
To address RA, we introduce an Enhanced Detail Indicator (EDI), which utilizes
the leaked identity information to supplement missing details, thus fixing the
artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixTalk effectively mitigates
IL and RA, achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most autonomous cars rely on the availability of high-definition (HD) maps.
Current research aims to address this constraint by directly predicting HD map
elements from onboard sensors and reasoning about the relationships between the
predicted map and traffic elements. Despite recent advancements, the coherent
online construction of HD maps remains a challenging endeavor, as it
necessitates modeling the high complexity of road topologies in a unified and
consistent manner. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent approach to
predict lane segments and their corresponding topology, as well as road
boundaries, all by leveraging prior map information represented by commonly

which leverages hybrid lane segment encodings comprising prior information and

Conclusion: 该方法在胎儿腹部异常分类中表现出色，为产前超声诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fetal abdominal malformations are serious congenital anomalies that require
accurate diagnosis to guide pregnancy management and reduce mortality. Although
AI has demonstrated significant potential in medical diagnosis, its application
to prenatal abdominal anomalies remains limited. Most existing studies focus on
image-level classification and rely on standard plane localization, placing
less emphasis on case-level diagnosis. In this paper, we develop a case-level
multiple instance learning (MIL)-based method, free of standard plane
localization, for classifying fetal abdominal anomalies in prenatal ultrasound.
Our contribution is three-fold. First, we adopt a mixture-of-attention-experts
module (MoAE) to weight different attention heads for various planes. Secondly,
we propose a medical-knowledge-driven feature selection module (MFS) to align
image features with medical knowledge, performing self-supervised image token
selection at the case-level. Finally, we propose a prompt-based prototype
learning (PPL) to enhance the MFS. Extensively validated on a large prenatal
abdominal ultrasound dataset containing 2,419 cases, with a total of 24,748
images and 6 categories, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art
competitors. Codes are available at:https://github.com/LL-AC/AAcls.

TL;DR: 论文提出CaptionSmiths，一种能够灵活控制图像描述语言模式（如长度和描述性）的模型，通过量化描述属性并插值端点向量实现平滑过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述模型难以细粒度控制生成描述的语言模式，因为训练时未考虑这些属性且无法平滑过渡。

Method: 量化描述的长度、描述性和词汇独特性为连续标量值，通过插值端点向量实现条件控制。

Result: 模型能平滑调整输出描述属性，词汇对齐优于基线，如长度控制误差减少506%。

Conclusion: CaptionSmiths展示了在单一模型中实现多样化语言模式控制的潜力。

Abstract: An image captioning model flexibly switching its language pattern, e.g.,
descriptiveness and length, should be useful since it can be applied to diverse
applications. However, despite the dramatic improvement in generative
vision-language models, fine-grained control over the properties of generated
captions is not easy due to two reasons: (i) existing models are not given the
properties as a condition during training and (ii) existing models cannot
smoothly transition its language pattern from one state to the other. Given
this challenge, we propose a new approach, CaptionSmiths, to acquire a single
captioning model that can handle diverse language patterns. First, our approach
quantifies three properties of each caption, length, descriptiveness, and
uniqueness of a word, as continuous scalar values, without human annotation.
Given the values, we represent the conditioning via interpolation between two
endpoint vectors corresponding to the extreme states, e.g., one for a very
short caption and one for a very long caption. Empirical results demonstrate
that the resulting model can smoothly change the properties of the output
captions and show higher lexical alignment than baselines. For instance,
CaptionSmiths reduces the error in controlling caption length by 506\% despite
better lexical alignment. Code will be available on

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度方向一致性的OOD检测方法，通过短路异常梯度提升检测效果，同时保持ID分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中部署深度学习模型时，OOD检测至关重要。观察到ID样本的梯度方向一致而OOD样本混乱，启发提出新方法。

Method: 提出推理阶段技术，短路异常梯度，避免重新计算logits，采用局部一阶近似捕捉修改后输出。

Result: 在标准OOD基准测试中表现显著提升，方法轻量且对标准推理流程改动小。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际应用中的鲁棒OOD检测提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safely deploying deep
models in open-world environments, where inputs may lie outside the training
distribution. During inference on a model trained exclusively with
In-Distribution (ID) data, we observe a salient gradient phenomenon: around an
ID sample, the local gradient directions for "enhancing" that sample's
predicted class remain relatively consistent, whereas OOD samples--unseen in
training--exhibit disorganized or conflicting gradient directions in the same
neighborhood. Motivated by this observation, we propose an inference-stage
technique to short-circuit those feature coordinates that spurious gradients
exploit to inflate OOD confidence, while leaving ID classification largely
intact. To circumvent the expense of recomputing the logits after this gradient
short-circuit, we further introduce a local first-order approximation that
accurately captures the post-modification outputs without a second forward
pass. Experiments on standard OOD benchmarks show our approach yields
substantial improvements. Moreover, the method is lightweight and requires
minimal changes to the standard inference pipeline, offering a practical path
toward robust OOD detection in real-world applications.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在文档图像阴影去除任务中表现出色，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Document shadow removal is a crucial task in the field of document image
enhancement. However, existing methods tend to remove shadows with constant
color background and ignore color shadows. In this paper, we first design a
diffusion model in latent space for document image shadow removal, called
DocShaDiffusion. It translates shadow images from pixel space to latent space,
enabling the model to more easily capture essential features. To address the
issue of color shadows, we design a shadow soft-mask generation module (SSGM).
It is able to produce accurate shadow mask and add noise into shadow regions
specially. Guided by the shadow mask, a shadow mask-aware guided diffusion
module (SMGDM) is proposed to remove shadows from document images by
supervising the diffusion and denoising process. We also propose a
shadow-robust perceptual feature loss to preserve details and structures in
document images. Moreover, we develop a large-scale synthetic document color
shadow removal dataset (SDCSRD). It simulates the distribution of realistic
color shadows and provides powerful supports for the training of models.
Experiments on three public datasets validate the proposed method's superiority
over state-of-the-art. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 实验证明DiffMark在典型Deepfake篡改中表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffMark为抗Deepfake篡改的鲁棒水印提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant security and privacy threats through malicious
facial manipulations. While robust watermarking can aid in authenticity
verification and source tracking, existing methods often lack the sufficient
robustness against Deepfake manipulations. Diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable performance in image generation, enabling the seamless fusion of
watermark with image during generation. In this study, we propose a novel
robust watermarking framework based on diffusion model, called DiffMark. By
modifying the training and sampling scheme, we take the facial image and
watermark as conditions to guide the diffusion model to progressively denoise
and generate corresponding watermarked image. In the construction of facial
condition, we weight the facial image by a timestep-dependent factor that
gradually reduces the guidance intensity with the decrease of noise, thus
better adapting to the sampling process of diffusion model. To achieve the
fusion of watermark condition, we introduce a cross information fusion (CIF)
module that leverages a learnable embedding table to adaptively extract
watermark features and integrates them with image features via cross-attention.
To enhance the robustness of the watermark against Deepfake manipulations, we
integrate a frozen autoencoder during training phase to simulate Deepfake
manipulations. Additionally, we introduce Deepfake-resistant guidance that
employs specific Deepfake model to adversarially guide the diffusion sampling
process to generate more robust watermarked images. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DiffMark on typical Deepfakes.

Motivation: 现有基于极大团搜索的PCR方法虽召回率高，但时间复杂度指数级增长，无法满足实时需求。

Method: 定义TurboClique为3-团，结合并行化PGS算法，通过高SC$^2$分数匹配对引导搜索，提升效率。

Result: TurboReg在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，速度提升显著（如3DMatch+FCGF数据集上快208.22倍）。

Conclusion: TurboReg通过轻量级团和并行化算法，在保持高召回率的同时大幅提升速度，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Robust estimation is essential in correspondence-based Point Cloud
Registration (PCR). Existing methods using maximal clique search in
compatibility graphs achieve high recall but suffer from exponential time
complexity, limiting their use in time-sensitive applications. To address this
challenge, we propose a fast and robust estimator, TurboReg, built upon a novel
lightweight clique, TurboClique, and a highly parallelizable Pivot-Guided
Search (PGS) algorithm. First, we define the TurboClique as a 3-clique within a
highly-constrained compatibility graph. The lightweight nature of the 3-clique
allows for efficient parallel searching, and the highly-constrained
compatibility graph ensures robust spatial consistency for stable
transformation estimation. Next, PGS selects matching pairs with high SC$^2$
scores as pivots, effectively guiding the search toward TurboCliques with
higher inlier ratios. Moreover, the PGS algorithm has linear time complexity
and is significantly more efficient than the maximal clique search with
exponential time complexity. Extensive experiments show that TurboReg achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple real-world datasets, with
substantial speed improvements. For example, on the 3DMatch+FCGF dataset,
TurboReg (1K) operates $208.22\times$ faster than 3DMAC while also achieving
higher recall. Our code is accessible at

Result: 在两个基准数据集上验证了OoDDINO的优越性和兼容性。

Conclusion: OoDDINO通过多级策略显著提升异常分割性能，并可作为插件增强其他模型。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation aims to identify Out-of-Distribution (OoD) anomalous
objects within images. Existing pixel-wise methods typically assign anomaly
scores individually and employ a global thresholding strategy to segment
anomalies. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches encounter significant
challenges in real-world applications: (1) neglecting spatial correlations
among pixels within the same object, resulting in fragmented segmentation; (2)
variabil ity in anomaly score distributions across image regions, causing
global thresholds to either generate false positives in background areas or
miss segments of anomalous objects. In this work, we introduce OoDDINO, a novel
multi-level anomaly segmentation framework designed to address these
limitations through a coarse-to-fine anomaly detection strategy. OoDDINO
combines an uncertainty-guided anomaly detection model with a pixel-level
segmentation model within a two-stage cascade architecture. Initially, we
propose an Orthogonal Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Strategy (OUAFS) that
sequentially integrates multiple uncertainty metrics with visual
representations, employing orthogonal constraints to strengthen the detection
model's capacity for localizing anomalous regions accurately. Subsequently, we
develop an Adaptive Dual-Threshold Network (ADT-Net), which dynamically
generates region-specific thresholds based on object-level detection outputs
and pixel-wise anomaly scores. This approach allows for distinct thresholding
strategies within foreground and background areas, achieving fine-grained
anomaly segmentation. The proposed framework is compatible with other
pixel-wise anomaly detection models, which acts as a plug-in to boost the
performance. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate our
framework's superiority and compatibility over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NOCTIS是一个简单但强大的框架，适用于新物体实例分割任务。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some
example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision.
Designing a model general enough to be employed, for all kinds of novel
objects, without (re-) training, has proven to be a difficult task. To handle
this, we propose a simple, yet powerful, framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic
Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). This work stems from and
improves upon previous ones like CNOS, SAM-6D and NIDS-Net; thus, it also
leverages on recent vision foundation models, namely: Grounded-SAM 2 and
DINOv2. It utilises Grounded-SAM 2 to obtain object proposals with precise
bounding boxes and their corresponding segmentation masks; while DINOv2's
zero-shot capabilities are employed to generate the image embeddings. The
quality of those masks, together with their embeddings, is of vital importance
to our approach; as the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an
object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the
average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings. Differently to SAM-6D,
calculating the latter involves a prior patch filtering based on the distance
between each patch and its corresponding cyclic/roundtrip patch in the image
grid. Furthermore, the average confidence of the proposals' bounding box and
mask is used as an additional weighting factor for the object matching score.
We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning,
outperforms the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the
BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects"
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如REPA）在去噪推理过程中未能充分利用判别性表征的潜力，因此需要一种更有效的方法来结合外部视觉表征。

Method: REG方法通过将低层图像潜在变量与预训练基础模型的单一高层类别标记结合，实现图像和类别的联合生成。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，SiT-XL/2 + REG实现了63倍和23倍的训练加速，且仅需400K次迭代即可超越4M次迭代的SiT-XL/2 + REPA。

Conclusion: REG方法通过表征纠缠显著提升了生成质量和训练效率，同时保持了极低的推理开销。

Abstract: REPA and its variants effectively mitigate training challenges in diffusion
models by incorporating external visual representations from pretrained models,
through alignment between the noisy hidden projections of denoising networks
and foundational clean image representations. We argue that the external
alignment, which is absent during the entire denoising inference process, falls
short of fully harnessing the potential of discriminative representations. In
this work, we propose a straightforward method called Representation
Entanglement for Generation (REG), which entangles low-level image latents with
a single high-level class token from pretrained foundation models for
denoising. REG acquires the capability to produce coherent image-class pairs
directly from pure noise, substantially improving both generation quality and
training efficiency. This is accomplished with negligible additional inference
overhead, requiring only one single additional token for denoising (<0.5\%
increase in FLOPs and latency). The inference process concurrently reconstructs
both image latents and their corresponding global semantics, where the acquired
semantic knowledge actively guides and enhances the image generation process.
On ImageNet 256$\times$256, SiT-XL/2 + REG demonstrates remarkable convergence
acceleration, achieving $\textbf{63}\times$ and $\textbf{23}\times$ faster
training than SiT-XL/2 and SiT-XL/2 + REPA, respectively. More impressively,
SiT-L/2 + REG trained for merely 400K iterations outperforms SiT-XL/2 + REPA
trained for 4M iterations ($\textbf{10}\times$ longer). Code is available at:

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and detecting its leaks early via
hyperspectral satellite imagery can help mitigate climate change. Meanwhile,
many existing missions operate in manual tasking regimes only, thus missing
potential events of interest. To overcome slow downlink rates cost-effectively,
onboard detection is a viable solution. However, traditional methane
enhancement methods are too computationally demanding for resource-limited
onboard hardware. This work accelerates methane detection by focusing on
efficient, low-power algorithms. We test fast target detection methods (ACE,
CEM) that have not been previously used for methane detection and propose a
Mag1c-SAS - a significantly faster variant of the current state-of-the-art
algorithm for methane detection: Mag1c. To explore their true detection
potential, we integrate them with a machine learning model (U-Net, LinkNet).
Our results identify two promising candidates (Mag1c-SAS and CEM), both
acceptably accurate for the detection of strong plumes and computationally
efficient enough for onboard deployment: one optimized more for accuracy, the
other more for speed, achieving up to ~100x and ~230x faster computation than
original Mag1c on resource-limited hardware. Additionally, we propose and
evaluate three band selection strategies. One of them can outperform the method
traditionally used in the field while using fewer channels, leading to even
faster processing without compromising accuracy. This research lays the
foundation for future advancements in onboard methane detection with minimal
hardware requirements, improving timely data delivery. The produced code, data,

Abstract: High-definition (HD) map construction methods are crucial for providing
precise and comprehensive static environmental information, which is essential
for autonomous driving systems. While Camera-LiDAR fusion techniques have shown
promising results by integrating data from both modalities, existing approaches
primarily focus on improving model accuracy and often neglect the robustness of
perception models, which is a critical aspect for real-world applications. In
this paper, we explore strategies to enhance the robustness of multi-modal
fusion methods for HD map construction while maintaining high accuracy. We
propose three key components: data augmentation, a novel multi-modal fusion
module, and a modality dropout training strategy. These components are
evaluated on a challenging dataset containing 10 days of NuScenes data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly
enhance the robustness of baseline methods. Furthermore, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the clean validation set of the NuScenes
dataset. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and
reliable HD map construction models, advancing their applicability in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Project website:

leverages the same foundation model's caption generation responses under varied

TL;DR: 提出一种基于ReFlow的实时图像编辑方法，通过分析中间表示和利用中步潜在变量提升编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ReFlow在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但在实时图像编辑中仍存在挑战。

Method: 分析多模态Transformer块的中间表示，提取关键特征，利用中步潜在变量并调整注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，用户评价显示强烈偏好。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、无需用户提供掩码，且无需源提示即可应用，具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Rectified Flow text-to-image models surpass diffusion models in image quality
and text alignment, but adapting ReFlow for real-image editing remains
challenging. We propose a new real-image editing method for ReFlow by analyzing
the intermediate representations of multimodal transformer blocks and
identifying three key features. To extract these features from real images with
sufficient structural preservation, we leverage mid-step latent, which is
inverted only up to the mid-step. We then adapt attention during injection to
improve editability and enhance alignment to the target text. Our method is
training-free, requires no user-provided mask, and can be applied even without
a source prompt. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with nine baselines
demonstrate its superior performance over prior methods, further validated by
human evaluations confirming a strong user preference for our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球变暖、生物多样性丧失和空气污染等问题亟需通过自动化监测森林来应对，而现有方法在树冠检测上仍有不足。

Method: 结合传统方法（特征提取与分割）和深度学习方法（树冠检测），并通过规则化后处理优化结果。

Result: 新方法提高了树冠检测数量，并分析了其优缺点和改进空间。

Conclusion: 提出的规则化方法有效提升了树冠检测性能，为森林监测提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Global warming, loss of biodiversity, and air pollution are among the most
significant problems facing Earth. One of the primary challenges in addressing
these issues is the lack of monitoring forests to protect them. To tackle this
problem, it is important to leverage remote sensing and computer vision methods
to automate monitoring applications. Hence, automatic tree crown detection
algorithms emerged based on traditional and deep learning methods. In this
study, we first introduce two different tree crown detection methods based on
these approaches. Then, we form a novel rule-based approach that integrates
these two methods to enhance robustness and accuracy of tree crown detection
results. While traditional methods are employed for feature extraction and
segmentation of forested areas, deep learning methods are used to detect tree
crowns in our method. With the proposed rule-based approach, we post-process
these results, aiming to increase the number of detected tree crowns through
neighboring trees and localized operations. We compare the obtained results
with the proposed method in terms of the number of detected tree crowns and
report the advantages, disadvantages, and areas for improvement of the obtained
outcomes.

TL;DR: 研究了端到端强化学习训练在图像目标导航任务中的有效性，探讨了架构选择对相对姿态估计的影响，并分析了模拟器设置对结果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索是否可以通过端到端强化学习训练解决图像目标导航任务，从而避免依赖专用图像匹配或预训练模块。

Method: 通过大规模研究分析不同架构选择（如延迟融合、通道堆叠、空间到深度投影和交叉注意力）对导航训练中相对姿态估计器的影响。

Result: 发现模拟器设置会影响方法效果，但部分能力可迁移到更现实的场景，同时导航性能与相对姿态估计性能相关。

Conclusion: 端到端强化学习在图像目标导航中具有一定潜力，但需注意模拟器设置的影响，且相对姿态估计是重要子技能。

Abstract: Image goal navigation requires two different skills: firstly, core navigation
skills, including the detection of free space and obstacles, and taking
decisions based on an internal representation; and secondly, computing
directional information by comparing visual observations to the goal image.
Current state-of-the-art methods either rely on dedicated image-matching, or
pre-training of computer vision modules on relative pose estimation. In this
paper, we study whether this task can be efficiently solved with end-to-end
training of full agents with RL, as has been claimed by recent work. A positive
answer would have impact beyond Embodied AI and allow training of relative pose
estimation from reward for navigation alone. In a large study we investigate
the effect of architectural choices like late fusion, channel stacking,
space-to-depth projections and cross-attention, and their role in the emergence
of relative pose estimators from navigation training. We show that the success
of recent methods is influenced up to a certain extent by simulator settings,
leading to shortcuts in simulation. However, we also show that these
capabilities can be transferred to more realistic setting, up to some extend.
We also find evidence for correlations between navigation performance and
probed (emerging) relative pose estimation performance, an important sub skill.

Abstract: The collection and release of street-level recordings as Open Data play a
vital role in advancing autonomous driving systems and AI research. However,
these datasets pose significant privacy risks, particularly for pedestrians,
due to the presence of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) that extends
beyond biometric traits such as faces. In this paper, we present cRID, a novel
cross-modal framework combining Large Vision-Language Models, Graph Attention
Networks, and representation learning to detect textual describable clues of
PII and enhance person re-identification (Re-ID). Our approach focuses on
identifying and leveraging interpretable features, enabling the detection of
semantically meaningful PII beyond low-level appearance cues. We conduct a
systematic evaluation of PII presence in person image datasets. Our experiments
show improved performance in practical cross-dataset Re-ID scenarios, notably
from Market-1501 to CUHK03-np (detected), highlighting the framework's
practical utility. Code is available at https://github.com/RAufschlaeger/cRID.

Result: 在五个数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SAM-MaGuP通过创新设计，为息肉分割领域设定了新标准。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is crucial for early detection and
diagnosis of colorectal cancer. However, this task remains a significant
challenge due to the substantial variations in polyp shape, size, and color, as
well as the high similarity between polyps and surrounding tissues, often
compounded by indistinct boundaries. While existing encoder-decoder CNN and
transformer-based approaches have shown promising results, they struggle with
stable segmentation performance on polyps with weak or blurry boundaries. These
methods exhibit limited abilities to distinguish between polyps and non-polyps
and capture essential boundary cues. Moreover, their generalizability still
falls short of meeting the demands of real-time clinical applications. To
address these limitations, we propose SAM-MaGuP, a groundbreaking approach for
robust polyp segmentation. By incorporating a boundary distillation module and
a 1D-2D Mamba adapter within the Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM-MaGuP excels
at resolving weak boundary challenges and amplifies feature learning through
enriched global contextual interactions. Extensive evaluations across five
diverse datasets reveal that SAM-MaGuP outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving unmatched segmentation accuracy and robustness. Our key innovations,
a Mamba-guided boundary prior and a 1D-2D Mamba block, set a new benchmark in
the field, pushing the boundaries of polyp segmentation to new heights.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) has evolved significantly, moving from
isolated recognition approaches to complex, continuous gloss-free translation
systems. This paper explores the impact of pose-based data preprocessing
techniques - normalization, interpolation, and augmentation - on SLT
performance. We employ a transformer-based architecture, adapting a modified T5
encoder-decoder model to process pose representations. Through extensive
ablation studies on YouTubeASL and How2Sign datasets, we analyze how different
preprocessing strategies affect translation accuracy. Our results demonstrate
that appropriate normalization, interpolation, and augmentation techniques can
significantly improve model robustness and generalization abilities.
Additionally, we provide a deep analysis of the model's attentions and reveal
interesting behavior suggesting that adding a dedicated register token can
improve overall model performance. We publish our code on our GitHub
repository, including the preprocessed YouTubeASL data.

Result: 在五个无人机跟踪基准测试中，TrackingMiM实现了最高精度和显著的速度提升。

Conclusion: TrackingMiM在无人机跟踪任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和实时性。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) model has long struggled with the challenge of
quadratic complexity, a limitation that becomes especially critical in unmanned
aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking systems, where data must be processed in real
time. In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba,
leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence
modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First,
we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based
methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the
Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose
TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model
for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba
scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and
spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query
token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted
on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves
state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV
tracking.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced numerous opportunities for human
assistance and task automation in medicine. However, it suffers from poor
generalization in the presence of shifts in the data distribution. In the
context of AI-based computed tomography (CT) analysis, significant data
distribution shifts can be caused by changes in scanner manufacturer,
reconstruction technique or dose. AI harmonization techniques can address this
problem by reducing distribution shifts caused by various acquisition settings.
This paper presents an open-source benchmark dataset containing CT scans of an
anthropomorphic phantom acquired with various scanners and settings, which
purpose is to foster the development of AI harmonization techniques. Using a
phantom allows fixing variations attributed to inter- and intra-patient
variations. The dataset includes 1378 image series acquired with 13 scanners
from 4 manufacturers across 8 institutions using a harmonized protocol as well
as several acquisition doses. Additionally, we present a methodology, baseline
results and open-source code to assess image- and feature-level stability and
liver tissue classification, promoting the development of AI harmonization
strategies.

Abstract: The field of neuromorphic vision is developing rapidly, and event cameras are
finding their way into more and more applications. However, the data stream
from these sensors is characterised by significant noise. In this paper, we
propose a method for event data that is capable of removing approximately 99\%
of noise while preserving the majority of the valid signal. We have proposed
four algorithms based on the matrix of infinite impulse response (IIR) filters
method. We compared them on several event datasets that were further modified
by adding artificially generated noise and noise recorded with dynamic vision
sensor. The proposed methods use about 30KB of memory for a sensor with a
resolution of 1280 x 720 and is therefore well suited for implementation in
embedded devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合判别式学习和扩散生成学习的方法（IDGBR），用于改进遥感图像语义分割中的边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖判别式学习，擅长捕捉低频特征但忽视高频边界细节，而扩散生成模型擅长生成高频细节但语义推断不足。

Method: IDGBR框架先用判别式模型生成粗分割图，再通过条件引导网络和扩散去噪过程细化边界。

Result: 在五个遥感数据集上的实验表明，IDGBR能一致地改进不同判别式架构的粗分割结果。

Conclusion: 结合判别式和生成式学习的优势，IDGBR显著提升了边界分割精度。

Abstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation must address both what the ground
objects are within an image and where they are located. Consequently,
segmentation models must ensure not only the semantic correctness of
large-scale patches (low-frequency information) but also the precise
localization of boundaries between patches (high-frequency information).
However, most existing approaches rely heavily on discriminative learning,
which excels at capturing low-frequency features, while overlooking its
inherent limitations in learning high-frequency features for semantic
segmentation. Recent studies have revealed that diffusion generative models
excel at generating high-frequency details. Our theoretical analysis confirms
that the diffusion denoising process significantly enhances the model's ability
to learn high-frequency features; however, we also observe that these models
exhibit insufficient semantic inference for low-frequency features when guided
solely by the original image. Therefore, we integrate the strengths of both
discriminative and generative learning, proposing the Integration of
Discriminative and diffusion-based Generative learning for Boundary Refinement
(IDGBR) framework. The framework first generates a coarse segmentation map
using a discriminative backbone model. This map and the original image are fed
into a conditioning guidance network to jointly learn a guidance representation
subsequently leveraged by an iterative denoising diffusion process refining the
coarse segmentation. Extensive experiments across five remote sensing semantic
segmentation datasets (binary and multi-class segmentation) confirm our
framework's capability of consistent boundary refinement for coarse results
from diverse discriminative architectures. The source code will be available at

Method: 采用扩散变换器（DiT）替代传统U-Net去噪器，通过轻量级通道拼接适配器和LoRA微调注入草图信息。

Result: 在SAKUGA数据集上表现优于现有方法，训练数据量仅为竞争模型的一半，且生成动画时间一致、伪影少。

Conclusion: SketchColour提供了一种高效、低成本的2D动画上色解决方案，显著提升了生产效率。

Abstract: The production of high-quality 2D animation is highly labor-intensive
process, as animators are currently required to draw and color a large number
of frames by hand. We present SketchColour, the first sketch-to-colour pipeline
for 2D animation built on a diffusion transformer (DiT) backbone. By replacing
the conventional U-Net denoiser with a DiT-style architecture and injecting
sketch information via lightweight channel-concatenation adapters accompanied
with LoRA finetuning, our method natively integrates conditioning without the
parameter and memory bloat of a duplicated ControlNet, greatly reducing
parameter count and GPU memory usage. Evaluated on the SAKUGA dataset,
SketchColour outperforms previous state-of-the-art video colourization methods
across all metrics, despite using only half the training data of competing
models. Our approach produces temporally coherent animations with minimal
artifacts such as colour bleeding or object deformation. Our code is available

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based image denoising methods have shown impressive

this paper, we introduce a new controllable denoising framework that adaptively
removes noise from images by utilizing information from camera parameters.
Specifically, we focus on ISO, shutter speed, and F-number, which are closely
related to noise levels. We convert these selected parameters into a vector to

results show that our method seamlessly adds controllability to standard
denoising neural networks and improves their performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时存在尺度差异累积和几何不一致的问题，主要依赖2D扩散先验而忽略了3D几何结构。

Result: 实验验证了DepthSync在多种数据集上能显著提升长视频深度估计的尺度和几何一致性。

Conclusion: DepthSync为长视频深度估计提供了一种高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video depth estimation methods have achieved remarkable
success with strong generalization ability. However, predicting depth for long
videos remains challenging. Existing methods typically split videos into
overlapping sliding windows, leading to accumulated scale discrepancies across
different windows, particularly as the number of windows increases.
Additionally, these methods rely solely on 2D diffusion priors, overlooking the
inherent 3D geometric structure of video depths, which results in geometrically
inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose DepthSync, a novel,
training-free framework using diffusion guidance to achieve scale- and
geometry-consistent depth predictions for long videos. Specifically, we
introduce scale guidance to synchronize the depth scale across windows and
geometry guidance to enforce geometric alignment within windows based on the
inherent 3D constraints in video depths. These two terms work synergistically,
steering the denoising process toward consistent depth predictions. Experiments
on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in producing depth
estimates with improved scale and geometry consistency, particularly for long
videos.

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security
concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor
attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured
in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the
first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition
systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of
DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the
first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and
face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained
with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our
models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack
cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function
of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and
countermeasures.

Motivation: 传统基于MSE优化的图像编码模型在潜在空间中语义信息有限，且需要大量计算资源进行微调，限制了其在压缩域语义推理中的有效性。

Method: 提出了POLC方法，通过优化潜在特征的语义内容，仅需一个即插即用的适配器进行微调，大幅减少了参数数量。

Conclusion: POLC为压缩域语义推理提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on
learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However,
MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic
richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks.
Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires
fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive,
especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce
Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the
semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain
semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only
a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter
count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results
demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to
state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing
performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead. Code is

### [106] [Prompt Guidance and Human Proximal Perception for HOT Prediction with Regional Joint Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01630)
*Yuxiao Wang,Yu Lei,Zhenao Wei,Weiying Xue,Xinyu Jiang,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为P3HOT的框架，结合提示引导和人类近端感知，用于改进人体与物体接触（HOT）检测任务。通过语义驱动提示和深度感知机制，解决了现有模型在区域分割和类别一致性上的问题，并引入新的损失函数和评估指标，实现了在多个指标上的最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOT检测模型局限于单一图像类型，导致过度分割和区域类别一致性不足，因此需要一种更有效的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: P3HOT框架结合语义驱动提示机制和人类近端感知机制，利用深度信息消除非交互区域，并引入Regional Joint Loss（RJLoss）和新的评估指标AD-Acc。

Result: 在HOT-Annotated数据集上，P3HOT在SC-Acc.、mIoU、wIoU和AD-Acc.四个指标上分别提升了0.7、2.0、1.6和11.0个百分点。

Conclusion: P3HOT通过结合提示引导和深度感知，显著提升了HOT检测的性能，为相关任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The task of Human-Object conTact (HOT) detection involves identifying the
specific areas of the human body that are touching objects. Nevertheless,
current models are restricted to just one type of image, often leading to too
much segmentation in areas with little interaction, and struggling to maintain
category consistency within specific regions. To tackle this issue, a HOT
framework, termed \textbf{P3HOT}, is proposed, which blends \textbf{P}rompt
guidance and human \textbf{P}roximal \textbf{P}erception. To begin with, we
utilize a semantic-driven prompt mechanism to direct the network's attention
towards the relevant regions based on the correlation between image and text.
Then a human proximal perception mechanism is employed to dynamically perceive
key depth range around the human, using learnable parameters to effectively
eliminate regions where interactions are not expected. Calculating depth
resolves the uncertainty of the overlap between humans and objects in a 2D
perspective, providing a quasi-3D viewpoint. Moreover, a Regional Joint Loss
(RJLoss) has been created as a new loss to inhibit abnormal categories in the
same area. A new evaluation metric called ``AD-Acc.'' is introduced to address
the shortcomings of existing methods in addressing negative samples.
Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in four metrics across two benchmark datasets.
Specifically, our model achieves an improvement of \textbf{0.7}$\uparrow$,
\textbf{2.0}$\uparrow$, \textbf{1.6}$\uparrow$, and \textbf{11.0}$\uparrow$ in
SC-Acc., mIoU, wIoU, and AD-Acc. metrics, respectively, on the HOT-Annotated
dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/YuxiaoWang-AI/P3HOT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Snake-NeRF是一种扩展到大场景的NeRF框架，通过分块处理和创新的3D瓦片策略，解决了内存限制问题，并在单GPU上实现了高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF方法因内存限制难以处理大场景，需改进以支持卫星图像等大规模数据。

Method: 提出Snake-NeRF，采用分块处理、图像重叠裁剪、2×2 3D瓦片策略和分段采样器，避免边缘错误。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在单GPU上线性时间处理大卫星图像，且质量无损失。

Conclusion: Snake-NeRF成功扩展了NeRF的应用范围，适用于大规模场景的3D重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as a paradigm for 3D
reconstruction from multiview satellite imagery. However, state-of-the-art NeRF
methods are typically constrained to small scenes due to the memory footprint
during training, which we study in this paper. Previous work on large-scale
NeRFs palliate this by dividing the scene into NeRFs. This paper introduces
Snake-NeRF, a framework that scales to large scenes. Our out-of-core method
eliminates the need to load all images and networks simultaneously, and
operates on a single device. We achieve this by dividing the region of interest
into NeRFs that 3D tile without overlap. Importantly, we crop the images with
overlap to ensure each NeRFs is trained with all the necessary pixels. We
introduce a novel $2\times 2$ 3D tile progression strategy and segmented
sampler, which together prevent 3D reconstruction errors along the tile edges.
Our experiments conclude that large satellite images can effectively be
processed with linear time complexity, on a single GPU, and without compromise
in quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础MDE模型在复杂开放世界环境中表现不佳，如光照变化、恶劣天气和传感器失真等挑战条件。

Method: 提出无监督一致性正则化微调范式，仅需少量未标记数据，并引入空间距离约束以学习块级相对关系。

Result: 实验证明模型在多种基准测试（包括恶劣天气、合成失真和通用场景）中具有零样本能力。

Conclusion: DepthAnything-AC在复杂环境下表现出色，解决了数据稀缺和伪标签质量低的问题。

Abstract: We present Depth Anything at Any Condition (DepthAnything-AC), a foundation
monocular depth estimation (MDE) model capable of handling diverse
environmental conditions. Previous foundation MDE models achieve impressive
performance across general scenes but not perform well in complex open-world
environments that involve challenging conditions, such as illumination
variations, adverse weather, and sensor-induced distortions. To overcome the
challenges of data scarcity and the inability of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels from corrupted images, we propose an unsupervised consistency
regularization finetuning paradigm that requires only a relatively small amount
of unlabeled data. Furthermore, we propose the Spatial Distance Constraint to
explicitly enforce the model to learn patch-level relative relationships,
resulting in clearer semantic boundaries and more accurate details.
Experimental results demonstrate the zero-shot capabilities of DepthAnything-AC
across diverse benchmarks, including real-world adverse weather benchmarks,
synthetic corruption benchmarks, and general benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT难以与LLM直接联合训练，存在参数初始化冲突和模态语义差距问题。

Method: 提出SAILViT，通过逐步特征细化实现粗到细的特征对齐和知识注入。

Result: SAILViT在不同参数规模、架构、训练策略和数据规模下表现出强大鲁棒性和泛化能力，显著提升MLLM在OpenCompass基准上的性能。

Conclusion: SAILViT有效解决了ViT与LLM联合训练的挑战，为MLLM在多模态任务中的性能提升提供了新方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential as foundation backbones in
establishing the visual comprehension capabilities of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although most ViTs achieve impressive performance through
image-text pair-based contrastive learning or self-supervised mechanisms, they
struggle to engage in connector-based co-training directly with LLMs due to
potential parameter initialization conflicts and modality semantic gaps. To
address the above challenges, this paper proposes SAILViT, a gradual feature
learning-enhanced ViT for facilitating MLLMs to break through performance
bottlenecks in complex multimodal interactions. SAILViT achieves
coarse-to-fine-grained feature alignment and world knowledge infusion with
gradual feature refinement, which better serves target training demands. We
perform thorough empirical analyses to confirm the powerful robustness and
generalizability of SAILViT across different dimensions, including parameter
sizes, model architectures, training strategies, and data scales. Equipped with
SAILViT, existing MLLMs show significant and consistent performance
improvements on the OpenCompass benchmark across extensive downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的立体匹配模型在恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，主要由于训练数据稀缺和特征提取困难，导致零样本泛化能力受限。

Method: 1. 提出扩散模拟管道生成高质量合成数据，减少域差距；2. 设计结合ConvNet和去噪Transformer的特征编码器，提取稳定特征。

Result: 实验表明，RobuSTereo显著提升了模型在多种恶劣天气下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: RobuSTereo通过数据增强和特征提取优化，有效解决了立体匹配模型在恶劣天气下的泛化问题。

Abstract: Learning-based stereo matching models struggle in adverse weather conditions
due to the scarcity of corresponding training data and the challenges in
extracting discriminative features from degraded images. These limitations
significantly hinder zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution weather
conditions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RobuSTereo}, a novel framework
that enhances the zero-shot generalization of stereo matching models under
adverse weather by addressing both data scarcity and feature extraction
challenges. First, we introduce a diffusion-based simulation pipeline with a
stereo consistency module, which generates high-quality stereo data tailored
for adverse conditions. By training stereo matching models on our synthetic
datasets, we reduce the domain gap between clean and degraded images,
significantly improving the models' robustness to unseen weather conditions.
The stereo consistency module ensures structural alignment across synthesized
image pairs, preserving geometric integrity and enhancing depth estimation
accuracy. Second, we design a robust feature encoder that combines a
specialized ConvNet with a denoising transformer to extract stable and reliable
features from degraded images. The ConvNet captures fine-grained local
structures, while the denoising transformer refines global representations,
effectively mitigating the impact of noise, low visibility, and weather-induced
distortions. This enables more accurate disparity estimation even under
challenging visual conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textbf{RobuSTereo} significantly improves the robustness and generalization of
stereo matching models across diverse adverse weather scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准标记化方法将特征限制在离散的网格中，限制了模型在稀疏场景下的潜力。

Method: 提出Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT)，通过连续放置标记，并结合oracle-guided搜索优化位置。

Result: SPoT显著减少了推理所需的标记数量，同时提升了性能。

Conclusion: SPoT为ViT架构提供了灵活、高效且可解释的新方向，将稀疏性转化为战略优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers naturally accommodate sparsity, yet standard tokenization
methods confine features to discrete patch grids. This constraint prevents
models from fully exploiting sparse regimes, forcing awkward compromises. We
propose Subpixel Placement of Tokens (SPoT), a novel tokenization strategy that
positions tokens continuously within images, effectively sidestepping
grid-based limitations. With our proposed oracle-guided search, we uncover
substantial performance gains achievable with ideal subpixel token positioning,
drastically reducing the number of tokens necessary for accurate predictions
during inference. SPoT provides a new direction for flexible, efficient, and
interpretable ViT architectures, redefining sparsity as a strategic advantage
rather than an imposed limitation.

Result: 在多个数据集（如BU-3DFE、Bosphorus等）上达到最先进水平，并在4D微表情识别中表现优异。

Conclusion: FACET-VLM为多模态面部表情识别提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) in 3D and 4D domains presents a
significant challenge in affective computing due to the complexity of spatial
and temporal facial dynamics. Its success is crucial for advancing applications
in human behavior understanding, healthcare monitoring, and human-computer
interaction. In this work, we propose FACET-VLM, a vision-language framework
for 3D/4D FER that integrates multiview facial representation learning with
semantic guidance from natural language prompts. FACET-VLM introduces three key
components: Cross-View Semantic Aggregation (CVSA) for view-consistent fusion,
Multiview Text-Guided Fusion (MTGF) for semantically aligned facial emotions,
and a multiview consistency loss to enforce structural coherence across views.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple benchmarks,
including BU-3DFE, Bosphorus, BU-4DFE, and BP4D-Spontaneous. We further extend
FACET-VLM to 4D micro-expression recognition (MER) on the 4DME dataset,
demonstrating strong performance in capturing subtle, short-lived emotional
cues. The extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and
substantial contributions of each individual component within the framework.
Overall, FACET-VLM offers a robust, extensible, and high-performing solution
for multimodal FER in both posed and spontaneous settings.

TL;DR: AdaGCD是一种基于自适应槽注意力的聚类对比学习框架，用于解决部分标记数据集中已知和未知类别的图像分类问题，无需预定义类别数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义类别数量等刚性假设，难以处理真实数据的复杂性和变异性，因此需要一种自适应机制。

Method: 提出AdaGCD框架，结合自适应槽注意力（AdaSlot），动态确定最优槽数量，实现灵活聚类。

Result: 在公开和细粒度数据集上的实验验证了AdaGCD的有效性，尤其在利用空间局部信息进行类别发现方面表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaGCD通过自适应表示和动态槽分配，显著提升了开放世界场景中的类别发现能力。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) tackles the challenging problem of
categorizing unlabeled images into both known and novel classes within a
partially labeled dataset, without prior knowledge of the number of unknown
categories. Traditional methods often rely on rigid assumptions, such as
predefining the number of classes, which limits their ability to handle the
inherent variability and complexity of real-world data. To address these
shortcomings, we propose AdaGCD, a cluster-centric contrastive learning
framework that incorporates Adaptive Slot Attention (AdaSlot) into the GCD
framework. AdaSlot dynamically determines the optimal number of slots based on
data complexity, removing the need for predefined slot counts. This adaptive
mechanism facilitates the flexible clustering of unlabeled data into known and
novel categories by dynamically allocating representational capacity. By
integrating adaptive representation with dynamic slot allocation, our method
captures both instance-specific and spatially clustered features, improving
class discovery in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on public and
fine-grained datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, emphasizing
the advantages of leveraging spatial local information for category discovery
in unlabeled image datasets.

Motivation: 传统小波去噪方法在提取传感器模式噪声（SPN）时需要反演步骤，效率较低，因此提出改进方法以优化流程。

Method: 将指纹构建为小波域指纹，直接在小波域进行指纹比较，省去反演步骤。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实数据集上检测精度更高，处理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 小波域指纹提取方法简化了流程，提高了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification
and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be
particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this
article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than
constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet
domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising
algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet
domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison
process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly
improve processing speed.

Motivation: 现有方法使用硬伪标签无法表示类别不确定性或错误，因此提出软自标记以改进网络训练。

Method: 提出了一种基于软自标记的辅助损失，系统评估了标准和新CRF松弛、邻域系统以及网络预测与软伪标签的连接项，并设计了一个通用的连续子问题求解器。

Result: 软自标记显著提升了基于涂鸦标签的训练效果，甚至优于更复杂的专用WSSS系统，有时超过全像素级监督。

Conclusion: 软自标记是一种有效的弱监督分割方法，其通用思想可应用于其他弱监督问题或系统。

Abstract: We consider weakly supervised segmentation where only a fraction of pixels
have ground truth labels (scribbles) and focus on a self-labeling approach
optimizing relaxations of the standard unsupervised CRF/Potts loss on unlabeled
pixels. While WSSS methods can directly optimize such losses via gradient
descent, prior work suggests that higher-order optimization can improve network
training by introducing hidden pseudo-labels and powerful CRF sub-problem
solvers, e.g. graph cut. However, previously used hard pseudo-labels can not
represent class uncertainty or errors, which motivates soft self-labeling. We
derive a principled auxiliary loss and systematically evaluate standard and new
CRF relaxations (convex and non-convex), neighborhood systems, and terms
connecting network predictions with soft pseudo-labels. We also propose a
general continuous sub-problem solver. Using only standard architectures, soft
self-labeling consistently improves scribble-based training and outperforms
significantly more complex specialized WSSS systems. It can outperform full
pixel-precise supervision. Our general ideas apply to other weakly-supervised
problems/systems.

Result: 发现稀疏模型在某些情况下表现出更高的可解释性、下游泛化能力和人类对齐性，但这些效果高度依赖于网络架构和参数规模。

Conclusion: 剪枝对视觉表示的影响复杂，需进一步研究其何时及如何带来益处。

Abstract: Pruning is widely used to reduce the complexity of deep learning models, but
its effects on interpretability and representation learning remain poorly
understood. This paper investigates how pruning influences vision models across
three key dimensions: (i) interpretability, (ii) unsupervised object discovery,
and (iii) alignment with human perception. We first analyze different vision
network architectures to examine how varying sparsity levels affect feature
attribution interpretability methods. Additionally, we explore whether pruning
promotes more succinct and structured representations, potentially improving
unsupervised object discovery by discarding redundant information while
preserving essential features. Finally, we assess whether pruning enhances the
alignment between model representations and human perception, investigating
whether sparser models focus on more discriminative features similarly to
humans. Our findings also reveal the presence of sweet spots, where sparse
models exhibit higher interpretability, downstream generalization and human
alignment. However, these spots highly depend on the network architectures and
their size in terms of trainable parameters. Our results suggest a complex
interplay between these three dimensions, highlighting the importance of
investigating when and how pruning benefits vision representations.

Conclusion: HOI-Dyn有效解决了3D人-物交互生成的挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) remains a
challenging task due to the difficulty of modeling detailed interaction
dynamics. Existing methods treat human and object motions independently,
resulting in physically implausible and causally inconsistent behaviors. In
this work, we present HOI-Dyn, a novel framework that formulates HOI generation
as a driver-responder system, where human actions drive object responses. At
the core of our method is a lightweight transformer-based interaction dynamics
model that explicitly predicts how objects should react to human motion. To
further enforce consistency, we introduce a residual-based dynamics loss that
mitigates the impact of dynamics prediction errors and prevents misleading
optimization signals. The dynamics model is used only during training,
preserving inference efficiency. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the quality of
HOI generation but also establishes a feasible metric for evaluating the
quality of generated interactions.

Result: DeRIS在非和多目标场景中表现出色，无需专门架构修改。

Conclusion: DeRIS通过模块化分析和协同机制，显著提升了RIS的性能和通用性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment
objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies
have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and
achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental
bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key
components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a
systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our
findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual
deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current
models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which
enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby
enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text
comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent
sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue
related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS
demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios
without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its
general applicability. The codes and models are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D ViTs在医学图像分割中表现不佳，但其自监督训练能力适合大体积医学数据。IAC是一种与神经血管疾病相关的生物标志物，自动化量化有助于大规模风险评估。

Method: 采用MAE框架预训练ViT，并在IST-3临床试验数据上微调，用于IAC分割。研究了ViT的关键设计选择，如小块大小和上采样方法。

Result: 自监督ViT在Dice分数上比监督nnU-Net基线高3.2分，对高切片厚度更鲁棒，临床风险分类提升46%。

Conclusion: MAE预训练的ViT在IAC分割中表现出色，为医学图像分析提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained significant popularity in the natural
image domain but have been less successful in 3D medical image segmentation.
Nevertheless, 3D ViTs are particularly interesting for large medical imaging
volumes due to their efficient self-supervised training within the masked
autoencoder (MAE) framework, which enables the use of imaging data without the
need for expensive manual annotations. intracranial arterial calcification
(IAC) is an imaging biomarker visible on routinely acquired CT scans linked to
neurovascular diseases such as stroke and dementia, and automated IAC
quantification could enable their large-scale risk assessment. We pre-train
ViTs with MAE and fine-tune them for IAC segmentation for the first time. To
develop our models, we use highly heterogeneous data from a large clinical
trial, the third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). We evaluate key aspects of
MAE pre-trained ViTs in IAC segmentation, and analyse the clinical
implications. We show: 1) our calibrated self-supervised ViT beats a strong
supervised nnU-Net baseline by 3.2 Dice points, 2) low patch sizes are crucial
for ViTs for IAC segmentation and interpolation upsampling with regular
convolutions is preferable to transposed convolutions for ViT-based models, and
3) our ViTs increase robustness to higher slice thicknesses and improve risk
group classification in a clinical scenario by 46%. Our code is available

*Nora Gourmelon,Marcel Dreier,Martin Mayr,Thorsten Seehaus,Dakota Pyles,Matthias Braun,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种自监督多模态预训练技术和一种混合模型架构，用于从SAR图像中提取冰川崩解前沿位置，显著提升了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冰川冰量损失加剧，需精确监测崩解前沿。现有基于ImageNet预训练的模型因领域差异表现不佳。

Method: 提出自监督预训练技术（利用新数据集SSL4SAR）和混合模型架构（Swin Transformer编码器+残差CNN解码器）。

Result: 模型在CaFFe基准数据集上平均距离误差为293米，优于之前最佳模型67米；集成模型误差75米，接近人类水平38米。

Conclusion: 新方法实现了对冰川崩解前沿季节性变化的精确监测。

Abstract: Glaciers are losing ice mass at unprecedented rates, increasing the need for
accurate, year-round monitoring to understand frontal ablation, particularly
the factors driving the calving process. Deep learning models can extract
calving front positions from Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery to track seasonal
ice losses at the calving fronts of marine- and lake-terminating glaciers. The
current state-of-the-art model relies on ImageNet-pretrained weights. However,
they are suboptimal due to the domain shift between the natural images in
ImageNet and the specialized characteristics of remote sensing imagery, in
particular for Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. To address this challenge, we
propose two novel self-supervised multimodal pretraining techniques that
leverage SSL4SAR, a new unlabeled dataset comprising 9,563 Sentinel-1 and 14
Sentinel-2 images of Arctic glaciers, with one optical image per glacier in the
dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel hybrid model architecture that
combines a Swin Transformer encoder with a residual Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) decoder. When pretrained on SSL4SAR, this model achieves a mean
distance error of 293 m on the "CAlving Fronts and where to Find thEm" (CaFFe)
benchmark dataset, outperforming the prior best model by 67 m. Evaluating an
ensemble of the proposed model on a multi-annotator study of the benchmark
dataset reveals a mean distance error of 75 m, approaching the human
performance of 38 m. This advancement enables precise monitoring of seasonal
changes in glacier calving fronts.

TL;DR: DisCon框架通过将离散标记作为条件信号而非生成目标，解决了连续标记建模的优化挑战，同时避免了量化带来的信息损失，显著提升了图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于自回归框架的视觉生成模型中量化过程导致的信息损失问题，同时避免连续标记建模的挑战。

Method: 提出DisCon框架，将离散标记作为条件信号，建模连续表示的条件概率。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256生成任务中，DisCon的gFID得分为1.38，优于现有自回归方法。

Conclusion: DisCon有效平衡了离散和连续表示的优点，显著提升了图像生成性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in
encoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)
frameworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based
visual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades
image fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to
autoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside
in a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an
unbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging
and increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on
the above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned
Continuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete
tokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the
conditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete
tokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token
modeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon
achieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\times$256 generation,
outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.

### [123] [Are Vision Transformer Representations Semantically Meaningful? A Case Study in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01788)
*Montasir Shams,Chashi Mahiul Islam,Shaeke Salman,Phat Tran,Xiuwen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision transformers (ViTs) 在医学影像任务中表现出色，但其语义表示缺乏意义且易受微小变化影响，导致分类不可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨 ViTs 在医学影像分类中的语义表示是否具有意义及其脆弱性。

Method: 使用基于投影梯度的算法分析 ViT 表示。

Result: ViT 表示缺乏语义意义，微小变化可导致分类准确率下降超过 60%。

Conclusion: ViTs 在安全关键系统中的部署面临重大挑战。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have rapidly gained prominence in medical imaging
tasks such as disease classification, segmentation, and detection due to their
superior accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models. However, due
to their size and complex interactions via the self-attention mechanism, they
are not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the
representations produced by such models are semantically meaningful. In this
paper, using a projected gradient-based algorithm, we show that their
representations are not semantically meaningful and they are inherently
vulnerable to small changes. Images with imperceptible differences can have
very different representations; on the other hand, images that should belong to
different semantic classes can have nearly identical representations. Such
vulnerability can lead to unreliable classification results; for example,
unnoticeable changes cause the classification accuracy to be reduced by over
60\%. %. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically
demonstrate this fundamental lack of semantic meaningfulness in ViT
representations for medical image classification, revealing a critical
challenge for their deployment in safety-critical systems.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗样本的迁移性对深度神经网络构成安全挑战，现有方法多关注单尺度图像，限制了攻击效果。

Method: 使用高斯滤波和三种下采样方法构建多尺度样本，计算各尺度损失函数的梯度并取平均以确定对抗扰动。

Result: SGP显著提高了攻击成功率，平均提升2.3%至32.6%，仅依赖迁移性。

Conclusion: SGP是一种可扩展性强的方法，易于集成到现有攻击中，有效提升对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples poses a significant security
challenge for deep neural networks, which can be attacked without knowing
anything about them. In this paper, we propose a new Segmented Gaussian Pyramid
(SGP) attack method to enhance the transferability, particularly against
defense models. Unlike existing methods that generally focus on single-scale
images, our approach employs Gaussian filtering and three types of downsampling
to construct a series of multi-scale examples. Then, the gradients of the loss
function with respect to each scale are computed, and their average is used to
determine the adversarial perturbations. The proposed SGP can be considered an
input transformation with high extensibility that is easily integrated into
most existing adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that in
contrast to the state-of-the-art methods, SGP significantly enhances attack
success rates against black-box defense models, with average attack success
rates increasing by 2.3% to 32.6%, based only on transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeLoRA是一种无需训练的框架，通过融合特定主题的LoRA模块实现多主题个性化图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多主题个性化生成中表现不佳，需要复杂调整或联合优化。

Method: 采用Full Token Tuning策略训练主题特定的LoRA模块，并在推理时通过Subject-Aware Inference激活对应模块。

Result: 实验表明FreeLoRA在主题保真度和提示一致性上表现优异。

Conclusion: FreeLoRA提供了一种简单且通用的方法，解决了多主题个性化生成的挑战。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation plays a crucial role in applications such as
virtual try-on and poster design. Existing approaches typically fine-tune
pretrained generative models or apply LoRA-based adaptations for individual
subjects. However, these methods struggle with multi-subject personalization,
as combining independently adapted modules often requires complex re-tuning or
joint optimization. We present FreeLoRA, a simple and generalizable framework
that enables training-free fusion of subject-specific LoRA modules for
multi-subject personalization. Each LoRA module is adapted on a few images of a
specific subject using a Full Token Tuning strategy, where it is applied across
all tokens in the prompt to encourage weakly supervised token-content
alignment. At inference, we adopt Subject-Aware Inference, activating each
module only on its corresponding subject tokens. This enables training-free
fusion of multiple personalized subjects within a single image, while
mitigating overfitting and mutual interference between subjects. Extensive
experiments show that FreeLoRA achieves strong performance in both subject
fidelity and prompt consistency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应动量和解耦对比学习框架（AMD），用于提升自动驾驶中长尾轨迹预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常仅依赖基础模型的预测误差，忽视了长尾轨迹模式的多样性和不确定性，导致对复杂和危险场景的预测能力不足。

Method: 结合改进的动量对比学习（MoCo-DT）和解耦对比学习（DCL）模块，设计了四种轨迹随机增强方法和在线迭代聚类策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和ETH/UCY数据集上，AMD在长尾轨迹预测和整体预测精度上均表现优异。

Conclusion: AMD框架有效提升了模型对长尾轨迹的识别能力，同时保持了高预测精度。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the future trajectories of traffic agents is essential
in autonomous driving. However, due to the inherent imbalance in trajectory
distributions, tail data in natural datasets often represents more complex and
hazardous scenarios. Existing studies typically rely solely on a base model's
prediction error, without considering the diversity and uncertainty of
long-tail trajectory patterns. We propose an adaptive momentum and decoupled
contrastive learning framework (AMD), which integrates unsupervised and
supervised contrastive learning strategies. By leveraging an improved momentum
contrast learning (MoCo-DT) and decoupled contrastive learning (DCL) module,
our framework enhances the model's ability to recognize rare and complex
trajectories. Additionally, we design four types of trajectory random
augmentation methods and introduce an online iterative clustering strategy,
allowing the model to dynamically update pseudo-labels and better adapt to the
distributional shifts in long-tail data. We propose three different criteria to
define long-tail trajectories and conduct extensive comparative experiments on
the nuScenes and ETH$/$UCY datasets. The results show that AMD not only
achieves optimal performance in long-tail trajectory prediction but also
demonstrates outstanding overall prediction accuracy.

Result: 在新提出的基准测试中，模型表现优于现有方法，光谱估计精度提升30%。

Conclusion: 多视角光谱滤镜结合商用硬件可实现更准确、实用的超光谱成像解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral reconstruction (HSR) from RGB images is a fundamentally
ill-posed problem due to severe spectral information loss. Existing approaches
typically rely on a single RGB image, limiting reconstruction accuracy. In this
work, we propose a novel multi-image-to-hyperspectral reconstruction (MI-HSR)
framework that leverages a triple-camera smartphone system, where two lenses
are equipped with carefully selected spectral filters. Our configuration,
grounded in theoretical and empirical analysis, enables richer and more diverse
spectral observations than conventional single-camera setups. To support this
new paradigm, we introduce Doomer, the first dataset for MI-HSR, comprising
aligned images from three smartphone cameras and a hyperspectral reference
camera across diverse scenes. We show that the proposed HSR model achieves
consistent improvements over existing methods on the newly proposed benchmark.
In a nutshell, our setup allows 30% towards more accurately estimated spectra
compared to an ordinary RGB camera. Our findings suggest that multi-view
spectral filtering with commodity hardware can unlock more accurate and
practical hyperspectral imaging solutions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep neural networks have driven significant progress
in image enhancement (IE). However, deploying deep learning models on
resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile devices, remains challenging due
to high computation and memory demands. To address these challenges and
facilitate real-time IE on mobile, we introduce an extremely lightweight

approach integrates reparameterization with an Incremental Weight Optimization
strategy to ensure efficiency. Additionally, we enhance performance with a
Feature Self-Transform module and a Hierarchical Dual-Path Attention mechanism,
optimized with a Local Variance-Weighted loss. With this efficient framework,
we are the first to achieve real-time IE inference at up to 1,100 frames per

trade-off between speed and performance across multiple IE tasks. The code will

Method: 提出动态时间槽变换器（DTST）模块，结合时间推理和预测未来最优槽初始化。

Result: 在多个手术数据库中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 无监督对象中心方法可应用于真实世界数据，成为医疗应用中的常见工具。

Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is an emerging paradigm for unsupervised
learning of structured, interpretable object-centric representations (slots).
This enables effective reasoning about objects and events at a low
computational cost and is thus applicable to critical healthcare applications,
such as real-time interpretation of surgical video. The heterogeneous scenes in
real-world applications like surgery are, however, difficult to parse into a
meaningful set of slots. Current approaches with an adaptive slot count perform
well on images, but their performance on surgical videos is low. To address
this challenge, we propose a dynamic temporal slot transformer (DTST) module
that is trained both for temporal reasoning and for predicting the optimal
future slot initialization. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
multiple surgical databases, demonstrating that unsupervised object-centric
methods can be applied to real-world data and become part of the common arsenal
in healthcare applications.

Result: 在Semi-LReID基准测试中，SPRED取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SPRED框架通过自增强循环设计，显著提升了半监督终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Current lifelong person re-identification (LReID) methods predominantly rely
on fully labeled data streams. However, in real-world scenarios where
annotation resources are limited, a vast amount of unlabeled data coexists with
scarce labeled samples, leading to the Semi-Supervised LReID (Semi-LReID)
problem where LReID methods suffer severe performance degradation. Existing
LReID methods, even when combined with semi-supervised strategies, suffer from
limited long-term adaptation performance due to struggling with the noisy
knowledge occurring during unlabeled data utilization. In this paper, we
pioneer the investigation of Semi-LReID, introducing a novel Self-Reinforcing
Prototype Evolution with Dual-Knowledge Cooperation framework (SPRED). Our key
innovation lies in establishing a self-reinforcing cycle between dynamic
prototype-guided pseudo-label generation and new-old knowledge collaborative
purification to enhance the utilization of unlabeled data. Specifically,
learnable identity prototypes are introduced to dynamically capture the
identity distributions and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. Then, the
dual-knowledge cooperation scheme integrates current model specialization and
historical model generalization, refining noisy pseudo-labels. Through this
cyclic design, reliable pseudo-labels are progressively mined to improve
current-stage learning and ensure positive knowledge propagation over long-term
learning. Experiments on the established Semi-LReID benchmarks show that our
SPRED achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了Reason50K数据集和ReasonBrain框架，用于处理复杂的隐式假设指令图像编辑任务，填补了现有方法在深度推理和细节提取上的不足。


<details>

Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑方法难以处理需要深度推理的复杂隐式假设指令，且缺乏支持此类任务的训练和评估数据集。

Method: 提出Reason50K数据集（包含50K样本）和ReasonBrain框架，结合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和扩散模型，并引入细粒度推理线索提取（FRCE）模块和跨模态增强器（CME）。

Result: ReasonBrain在推理场景中表现优于现有方法，并在传统指令编辑任务中展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: Reason50K和ReasonBrain为复杂指令编辑任务提供了有效解决方案，并展示了广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success
of diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and
explicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,
moving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit
hypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible
visual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited
support for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.
Architecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail
extraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we
propose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and
evaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with
ReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit
hypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K
samples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and
Story reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
for editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,
incorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture
detailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction
reasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal
Enhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and
MLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios
while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks. Our
dataset and code will be released publicly.

Motivation: 临床实施DIR需要基于体素的空间精度指标（如手动标记点），但对于高度移动的GI器官难以实现。

Method: 通过半自动化管道，从静态3D患者扫描生成21个运动相位模拟GI运动，并使用六种DIR方法进行评估。

Result: DT模拟的GI运动与真实患者数据相似，提供了详细的DIR性能指标和剂量映射验证。

Conclusion: 该管道能够严格测试DIR工具在动态复杂解剖区域的性能，支持空间和剂量精度的详细评估。

Abstract: Objective: Clinical implementation of deformable image registration (DIR)
requires voxel-based spatial accuracy metrics such as manually identified
landmarks, which are challenging to implement for highly mobile
gastrointestinal (GI) organs. To address this, patient-specific digital twins
(DT) modeling temporally varying motion were created to assess the accuracy of
DIR methods. Approach: 21 motion phases simulating digestive GI motion as 4D
sequences were generated from static 3D patient scans using published
analytical GI motion models through a semi-automated pipeline. Eleven datasets,
including six T2w FSE MRI (T2w MRI), two T1w 4D golden-angle stack-of-stars,
and three contrast-enhanced CT scans. The motion amplitudes of the DTs were
assessed against real patient stomach motion amplitudes extracted from
independent 4D MRI datasets. The generated DTs were then used to assess six
different DIR methods using target registration error, Dice similarity
coefficient, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance using summary metrics
and voxel-level granular visualizations. Finally, for a subset of T2w MRI scans
from patients treated with MR-guided radiation therapy, dose distributions were
warped and accumulated to assess dose warping errors, including evaluations of
DIR performance in both low- and high-dose regions for patient-specific error
estimation. Main results: Our proposed pipeline synthesized DTs modeling
realistic GI motion, achieving mean and maximum motion amplitudes and a mean
log Jacobian determinant within 0.8 mm and 0.01, respectively, similar to
published real-patient gastric motion data. It also enables the extraction of
detailed quantitative DIR performance metrics and rigorous validation of dose
mapping accuracy. Significance: The pipeline enables rigorously testing DIR
tools for dynamic, anatomically complex regions enabling granular spatial and
dosimetric accuracies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 果园自动化中，生长期的密集树叶遮挡了树冠结构，限制了机器视觉系统的能力，而休眠期树冠结构更清晰可见。

Method: 结合YOLOv9-Seg进行实例分割，Kinect Fusion进行3D重建，Fast GICP进行模型对齐，实现多季节数据融合。

Result: YOLOv9-Seg的MSE为0.0047，分割mAP@50达0.78；Kinect Fusion的RMSE为5.23 mm（树干直径）；Fast GICP的配准精度达0.00197。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多季节数据融合，显著提升了果园自动化操作的精度，尤其在修剪和疏果等任务中。

Abstract: In orchard automation, dense foliage during the canopy season severely
occludes tree structures, minimizing visibility to various canopy parts such as
trunks and branches, which limits the ability of a machine vision system.
However, canopy structure is more open and visible during the dormant season
when trees are defoliated. In this work, we present an information fusion
framework that integrates multi-seasonal structural data to support robotic and
automated crop load management during the entire growing season. The framework
combines high-resolution RGB-D imagery from both dormant and canopy periods
using YOLOv9-Seg for instance segmentation, Kinect Fusion for 3D
reconstruction, and Fast Generalized Iterative Closest Point (Fast GICP) for
model alignment. Segmentation outputs from YOLOv9-Seg were used to extract
depth-informed masks, which enabled accurate 3D point cloud reconstruction via
Kinect Fusion; these reconstructed models from each season were subsequently
aligned using Fast GICP to achieve spatially coherent multi-season fusion. The
YOLOv9-Seg model, trained on manually annotated images, achieved a mean squared
error (MSE) of 0.0047 and segmentation mAP@50 scores up to 0.78 for trunks in
dormant season dataset. Kinect Fusion enabled accurate reconstruction of tree
geometry, validated with field measurements resulting in root mean square
errors (RMSE) of 5.23 mm for trunk diameter, 4.50 mm for branch diameter, and
13.72 mm for branch spacing. Fast GICP achieved precise cross-seasonal
registration with a minimum fitness score of 0.00197, allowing integrated,
comprehensive tree structure modeling despite heavy occlusions during the
growing season. This fused structural representation enables robotic systems to
access otherwise obscured architectural information, improving the precision of
pruning, thinning, and other automated orchard operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像定制方法缺乏通用框架，限制了多样化应用。

Method: 提出IC-Custom框架，利用DiT的多模态注意力机制和ICMA机制，结合高质量数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，人类偏好提升73%，仅训练0.4%参数。

Conclusion: IC-Custom为工业应用提供了高效、通用的图像定制解决方案。

Abstract: Image customization, a crucial technique for industrial media production,
aims to generate content that is consistent with reference images. However,
current approaches conventionally separate image customization into
position-aware and position-free customization paradigms and lack a universal
framework for diverse customization, limiting their applications across various
scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose IC-Custom, a unified
framework that seamlessly integrates position-aware and position-free image
customization through in-context learning. IC-Custom concatenates reference
images with target images to a polyptych, leveraging DiT's multi-modal
attention mechanism for fine-grained token-level interactions. We introduce the
In-context Multi-Modal Attention (ICMA) mechanism with learnable task-oriented
register tokens and boundary-aware positional embeddings to enable the model to
correctly handle different task types and distinguish various inputs in
polyptych configurations. To bridge the data gap, we carefully curated a
high-quality dataset of 12k identity-consistent samples with 8k from real-world
sources and 4k from high-quality synthetic data, avoiding the overly glossy and
over-saturated synthetic appearance. IC-Custom supports various industrial
applications, including try-on, accessory placement, furniture arrangement, and
creative IP customization. Extensive evaluations on our proposed ProductBench
and the publicly available DreamBench demonstrate that IC-Custom significantly
outperforms community workflows, closed-source models, and state-of-the-art
open-source approaches. IC-Custom achieves approximately 73% higher human
preference across identity consistency, harmonicity, and text alignment
metrics, while training only 0.4% of the original model parameters. Project

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable results in computer vision
tasks. In the early days, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were the
mainstream architecture. In recent years, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
become increasingly popular. In addition, exploring applications of multi-layer
perceptrons (MLPs) has provided new perspectives for research into vision model
architectures. In this paper, we present evMLP accompanied by a simple
event-driven local update mechanism. The proposed evMLP can independently
process patches on images or feature maps via MLPs. We define changes between
consecutive frames as "events". Under the event-driven local update mechanism,
evMLP selectively processes patches where events occur. For sequential image
data (e.g., video processing), this approach improves computational performance
by avoiding redundant computations. Through ImageNet image classification
experiments, evMLP attains accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art models.
More significantly, experimental results on multiple video datasets demonstrate
that evMLP reduces computational cost via its event-driven local update
mechanism while maintaining output consistency with its non-event-driven
baseline. The code and trained models are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集主要为孤立的文本-视频对，无法支持多场景连贯视频序列的建模。

Method: 引入CI-VID数据集，包含34万样本，每个样本为连贯的视频剪辑序列，附带文本描述。

Result: 实验表明，基于CI-VID训练的模型在生成视频序列时，准确性和内容一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: CI-VID数据集推动了故事驱动内容的生成，具有高质量和实用性。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has recently attracted considerable attention,
resulting in the development of numerous high-quality datasets that have
propelled progress in this area. However, existing public datasets are
primarily composed of isolated text-video (T-V) pairs and thus fail to support
the modeling of coherent multi-clip video sequences. To address this
limitation, we introduce CI-VID, a dataset that moves beyond isolated
text-to-video (T2V) generation toward text-and-video-to-video (TV2V)
generation, enabling models to produce coherent, multi-scene video sequences.
CI-VID contains over 340,000 samples, each featuring a coherent sequence of
video clips with text captions that capture both the individual content of each
clip and the transitions between them, enabling visually and textually grounded
generation. To further validate the effectiveness of CI-VID, we design a
comprehensive, multi-dimensional benchmark incorporating human evaluation,
VLM-based assessment, and similarity-based metrics. Experimental results
demonstrate that models trained on CI-VID exhibit significant improvements in
both accuracy and content consistency when generating video sequences. This
facilitates the creation of story-driven content with smooth visual transitions
and strong temporal coherence, underscoring the quality and practical utility
of the CI-VID dataset We release the CI-VID dataset and the accompanying code
for data construction and evaluation at: https://github.com/ymju-BAAI/CI-VID

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LongAnimation的新框架，用于实现动画长序列着色，解决了现有方法在长序列中颜色一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动画着色在动画产业中成本高昂，现有方法仅适用于短序列且忽视全局信息，无法保持长序列颜色一致性。

Method: 结合动态全局-局部范式，提出SketchDiT、DGLM模块和颜色一致性奖励机制，动态提取全局特征并与局部特征融合。

Result: 在短序列（14帧）和长序列（平均500帧）实验中，LongAnimation均表现出色，保持了颜色一致性。

Conclusion: LongAnimation通过动态全局-局部范式有效解决了长序列动画着色的颜色一致性问题。

Abstract: Animation colorization is a crucial part of real animation industry
production. Long animation colorization has high labor costs. Therefore,
automated long animation colorization based on the video generation model has
significant research value. Existing studies are limited to short-term
colorization. These studies adopt a local paradigm, fusing overlapping features
to achieve smooth transitions between local segments. However, the local
paradigm neglects global information, failing to maintain long-term color
consistency. In this study, we argue that ideal long-term color consistency can
be achieved through a dynamic global-local paradigm, i.e., dynamically
extracting global color-consistent features relevant to the current generation.
Specifically, we propose LongAnimation, a novel framework, which mainly
includes a SketchDiT, a Dynamic Global-Local Memory (DGLM), and a Color
Consistency Reward. The SketchDiT captures hybrid reference features to support
the DGLM module. The DGLM module employs a long video understanding model to
dynamically compress global historical features and adaptively fuse them with
the current generation features. To refine the color consistency, we introduce
a Color Consistency Reward. During inference, we propose a color consistency
fusion to smooth the video segment transition. Extensive experiments on both
short-term (14 frames) and long-term (average 500 frames) animations show the
effectiveness of LongAnimation in maintaining short-term and long-term color
consistency for open-domain animation colorization task. The code can be found

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在静态图像上表现优秀，但在动态、信息密集的短视频理解上不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 采用四阶段预训练和两阶段后训练，包括创新的五模式数据混合和强化学习，以提升推理能力。

Result: Keye-VL在公共视频基准测试中达到SOTA，并在通用图像任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Kwai Keye-VL成功填补了短视频理解的技术空白，并通过新基准KC-MMBench验证了其优势。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities on static images, they often fall short in comprehending dynamic,
information-dense short-form videos, a dominant medium in today's digital
landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an
8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge
performance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust
general-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on
two core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens
with a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe
features a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,
followed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first
post-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction
following, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In
this second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data
mixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think
with image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to
decide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and
alignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct
abnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,
we conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves
state-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly
competitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop
and release the \textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world
short-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练扩散模型的微调，受限于时间和语义/布局差异，而无需调优的方法在保持高质量结果方面存在挑战。

Method: 1）提出指导感知的球面插值设计，通过修改自注意力模块解决身份丢失问题；2）引入步骤导向的变化趋势，混合输入图像的自注意力模块以实现可控过渡。

Result: FreeMorph在图像变形任务中表现优异，速度提升10x~50x，并达到新的最佳水平。

Conclusion: FreeMorph通过创新设计解决了无需调优方法的挑战，为图像变形领域提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We present FreeMorph, the first tuning-free method for image morphing that
accommodates inputs with different semantics or layouts. Unlike existing
methods that rely on finetuning pre-trained diffusion models and are limited by
time constraints and semantic/layout discrepancies, FreeMorph delivers
high-fidelity image morphing without requiring per-instance training. Despite
their efficiency and potential, tuning-free methods face challenges in
maintaining high-quality results due to the non-linear nature of the multi-step
denoising process and biases inherited from the pre-trained diffusion model. In
this paper, we introduce FreeMorph to address these challenges by integrating
two key innovations. 1) We first propose a guidance-aware spherical
interpolation design that incorporates explicit guidance from the input images
by modifying the self-attention modules, thereby addressing identity loss and
ensuring directional transitions throughout the generated sequence. 2) We
further introduce a step-oriented variation trend that blends self-attention
modules derived from each input image to achieve controlled and consistent
transitions that respect both inputs. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate
that FreeMorph outperforms existing methods, being 10x ~ 50x faster and
establishing a new state-of-the-art for image morphing.

TL;DR: 论文评估了多模态基础模型在标准计算机视觉任务上的表现，发现它们虽不及专业模型，但作为通用模型表现尚可，且在语义任务上优于几何任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态基础模型在视觉理解上的实际能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过提示链将标准视觉任务转化为文本提示和API兼容的任务，建立标准化评估框架。

Result: 模型在语义任务上表现较好，但在几何任务上较弱；GPT-4o在非推理模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多模态基础模型在通用视觉任务上表现尚可，但仍有改进空间，尤其是在几何任务和提示敏感性方面。

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models, such as GPT-4o, have recently made remarkable
progress, but it is not clear where exactly these models stand in terms of
understanding vision. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of popular
multimodal foundation models (GPT-4o, o4-mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 2.0
Flash, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Qwen2-VL, Llama 3.2) on standard computer vision
tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image classification, depth and
surface normal prediction) using established datasets (e.g., COCO, ImageNet and
its variants, etc).
  The main challenges to performing this are: 1) most models are trained to
output text and cannot natively express versatile domains, such as segments or
3D geometry, and 2) many leading models are proprietary and accessible only at
an API level, i.e., there is no weight access to adapt them. We address these
challenges by translating standard vision tasks into equivalent text-promptable
and API-compatible tasks via prompt chaining to create a standardized
benchmarking framework.
  We observe that 1) the models are not close to the state-of-the-art
specialist models at any task. However, 2) they are respectable generalists;
this is remarkable as they are presumably trained on primarily image-text-based
tasks. 3) They perform semantic tasks notably better than geometric ones. 4)
While the prompt-chaining techniques affect performance, better models exhibit
less sensitivity to prompt variations. 5) GPT-4o performs the best among
non-reasoning models, securing the top position in 4 out of 6 tasks, 6)
reasoning models, e.g. o3, show improvements in geometric tasks, and 7) a
preliminary analysis of models with native image generation, like the latest
GPT-4o, shows they exhibit quirks like hallucinations and spatial
misalignments.

TL;DR: 提出Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD)加速自回归图像生成，通过灵活并行架构和局部感知生成顺序，显著减少生成步骤和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归图像生成依赖顺序预测，导致高延迟；现有并行化方法效果有限。

Method: 1. 灵活并行自回归建模，支持任意生成顺序和并行度；2. 局部感知生成顺序，最小化组内依赖。

Result: 在ImageNet上，生成步骤从256降至20（256×256分辨率），延迟降低至少3.4倍。

Conclusion: LPD在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了并行效率和速度。

Abstract: We present Locality-aware Parallel Decoding (LPD) to accelerate
autoregressive image generation. Traditional autoregressive image generation
relies on next-patch prediction, a memory-bound process that leads to high
latency. Existing works have tried to parallelize next-patch prediction by
shifting to multi-patch prediction to accelerate the process, but only achieved
limited parallelization. To achieve high parallelization while maintaining
generation quality, we introduce two key techniques: (1) Flexible Parallelized
Autoregressive Modeling, a novel architecture that enables arbitrary generation
ordering and degrees of parallelization. It uses learnable position query
tokens to guide generation at target positions while ensuring mutual visibility
among concurrently generated tokens for consistent parallel decoding. (2)
Locality-aware Generation Ordering, a novel schedule that forms groups to
minimize intra-group dependencies and maximize contextual support, enhancing
generation quality. With these designs, we reduce the generation steps from 256
to 20 (256$\times$256 res.) and 1024 to 48 (512$\times$512 res.) without
compromising quality on the ImageNet class-conditional generation, and
achieving at least 3.4$\times$ lower latency than previous parallelized
autoregressive models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FSIGenZ提出了一种少样本启发的生成零样本学习框架，通过动态调整属性评分和原型估计，减少对大规模特征合成的依赖，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成零样本学习方法需要大量计算资源和合成数据，违背了零样本学习的初衷。FSIGenZ旨在减少这种依赖，同时处理类级属性的实例级变异性。

Method: 引入模型特定属性评分（MSAS）动态调整属性评分，估计基于MSAS调整的组级原型作为未见类的合成特征，并使用双重目的语义正则化（DPSR）训练语义感知对比分类器（SCC）。

Result: 在SUN、AwA2和CUB基准测试中，FSIGenZ使用更少的合成特征实现了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: FSIGenZ通过动态属性评分和原型估计，有效减少了计算和合成数据需求，同时保持了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: Generative zero-shot learning (ZSL) methods typically synthesize visual
features for unseen classes using predefined semantic attributes, followed by
training a fully supervised classification model. While effective, these
methods require substantial computational resources and extensive synthetic
data, thereby relaxing the original ZSL assumptions. In this paper, we propose
FSIGenZ, a few-shot-inspired generative ZSL framework that reduces reliance on
large-scale feature synthesis. Our key insight is that class-level attributes
exhibit instance-level variability, i.e., some attributes may be absent or
partially visible, yet conventional ZSL methods treat them as uniformly
present. To address this, we introduce Model-Specific Attribute Scoring (MSAS),
which dynamically re-scores class attributes based on model-specific
optimization to approximate instance-level variability without access to unseen
data. We further estimate group-level prototypes as clusters of instances based
on MSAS-adjusted attribute scores, which serve as representative synthetic
features for each unseen class. To mitigate the resulting data imbalance, we
introduce a Dual-Purpose Semantic Regularization (DPSR) strategy while training
a semantic-aware contrastive classifier (SCC) using these prototypes.
Experiments on SUN, AwA2, and CUB benchmarks demonstrate that FSIGenZ achieves
competitive performance using far fewer synthetic features.

<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）面临计算和内存挑战，量化是解决方案，但传统量化方法因权重分布和激活异常值而效果受限。

Method: DBellQuant采用LTDB算法，将单钟权重分布转换为双钟形式以减少二值化误差，并通过逆变换平滑激活。

Result: 在Wikitext2数据集上，DBellQuant在LLaMA2-13B上实现了14.39的困惑度，显著优于BiLLM的21.35。

Conclusion: DBellQuant在激进量化的同时保持模型性能，为LLMs的实际应用提供了高效压缩方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance but face
substantial computational and memory challenges that limit their practical
deployment. Quantization has emerged as a promising solution; however, its
effectiveness is often limited by quantization errors arising from weight
distributions that are not quantization-friendly and the presence of activation
outliers. To address these challenges, we introduce DBellQuant, an innovative
post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that achieves nearly 1-bit weight
compression and 6-bit activation quantization with minimal performance
degradation. DBellQuant uses Learnable Transformation for Dual-Bell (LTDB)
algorithm, which transforms single-bell weight distributions into dual-bell
forms to reduce binarization errors and applies inverse transformations to
smooth activations. DBellQuant sets a new state-of-the-art by preserving
superior model performance under aggressive weight and activation quantization.
For example, on the Wikitext2 dataset, DBellQuant achieves a perplexity of
14.39 on LLaMA2-13B with 6-bit activation quantization, significantly
outperforming BiLLM's 21.35 without activation quantization, underscoring its
potential in compressing LLMs for real-world applications.

Result: 在一般情况下，这些方法虽不优化原始目标函数，但能避免崩溃；在线性情况下，原始目标函数会导致崩溃。

Conclusion: 停止梯度和指数移动平均的极限点是渐近稳定的平衡点，避免了崩溃风险。

Abstract: The objective of non-contrastive approaches to self-supervised learning is to
train on pairs of different views of the data an encoder and a predictor that
minimize the mean discrepancy between the code predicted from the embedding of
the first view and the embedding of the second one. In this setting, the stop
gradient and exponential moving average iterative procedures are commonly used
to avoid representation collapse, with excellent performance in downstream
supervised applications. This presentation investigates these procedures from
the dual theoretical viewpoints of optimization and dynamical systems. We first
show that, in general, although they do not optimize the original objective, or
for that matter, any other smooth function, they do avoid collapse. Following
Tian et al. [2021], but without any of the extra assumptions used in their
proofs, we then show using a dynamical system perspective that, in the linear
case, minimizing the original objective function without the use of a stop
gradient or exponential moving average always leads to collapse. Conversely, we
finally show that the limit points of the dynamical systems associated with
these two procedures are, in general, asymptotically stable equilibria, with no
risk of degenerating to trivial solutions.

Abstract: With the development of generative artificial intelligence and instruction
tuning techniques, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made
impressive progress on general reasoning tasks. Benefiting from the
chain-of-thought (CoT) methodology, MLLMs can solve the visual reasoning
problem step-by-step. However, existing MLLMs still face significant challenges
when applied to pathology visual reasoning tasks: (1) LLMs often underperforms
because they lack domain-specific information, which can lead to model
hallucinations. (2) The additional reasoning steps in CoT may introduce errors,
leading to the divergence of answers. To address these limitations, we propose
PathCoT, a novel zero-shot CoT prompting method which integrates the pathology
expert-knowledge into the reasoning process of MLLMs and incorporates
self-evaluation to mitigate divergence of answers. Specifically, PathCoT guides
the MLLM with prior knowledge to perform as pathology experts, and provides
comprehensive analysis of the image with their domain-specific knowledge. By
incorporating the experts' knowledge, PathCoT can obtain the answers with CoT
reasoning. Furthermore, PathCoT incorporates a self-evaluation step that
assesses both the results generated directly by MLLMs and those derived through
CoT, finally determining the reliable answer. The experimental results on the
PathMMU dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on pathology visual
understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet
Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical
representation. The practical implementation of FGM requires a significant
allocation of memory resources. FGM libraries are developed specifically for a
specific fuel and subsequently utilized for all numerical problems using
machine learning techniques. This research aims to develop libraries of Laminar
FGM utilizing machine learning algorithms for application in combustion
simulations of methane fuel. This study employs four Machine Learning
algorithms to regenerate Flamelet libraries, based on an understanding of data
sources, techniques, and data-driven concepts. 1. Multi-Layer Perceptron; 2.
Random Forest; 3. Linear Regression; 4. Support Vector Machine. Seven libraries
were identified as appropriate for constructing a database for training machine
learning models, giving an error rate of 2.30%. The default architectures of
each method were evaluated to determine the optimal approach, leading to the
selection of the MLP method as the primary choice. The method was enhanced
through hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The quantity of hidden
layers and neurons significantly influences method performance. The optimal
model, comprising four hidden layers with 10, 15, 20, and 25 neurons
respectively, achieved an accuracy of 99.81%.

Abstract: Geometric learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
non-Euclidean data, especially graph-structured ones, with applications
spanning social networks, molecular structures, knowledge graphs, and
recommender systems. While Nvidia's CUDA-enabled graphics processing units
(GPUs) largely dominate the hardware landscape, emerging accelerators such as
Intel's Gaudi Habana Processing Units (HPUs) offer competitive performance and
energy efficiency. However, the usage of such non-CUDA processing units
requires significant engineering effort and novel software adaptations. In this
work, we present our experiences porting PyTorch-based geometric learning
frameworks to Gaudi-v2 HPUs. We introduce a collection of core utilities that
restore essential operations (e.g., scatter, sparse indexing, k-nearest
neighbors) on Gaudi-v2 HPUs, and we consolidate sixteen guided tutorials and
eleven real-world examples with diagnostic analyses of encountered failures and
detailed workarounds. We collect all our experiences into a publicly accessible
GitHub repository. Our contributions lower the barrier for researchers to
experiment with geometric-learning algorithms and models on non-CUDA hardware,
providing a foundation for further optimization and cross-platform portability.

minimizing testing costs. Methodology: At the single-omics level, we refine the
activation functions of neural networks to generate Dirichlet distribution
parameters, utilizing subjective logic to quantify both the belief masses and
uncertainty mass of classification results. Belief mass reflects the support of
a specific omics modality for a disease class, while the uncertainty parameter
captures limitations in data quality and model discriminability, providing a
more trustworthy basis for decision-making. At the multi omics level, we employ
a fusion strategy based on Dempster-Shafer theory to integrate heterogeneous
modalities, leveraging their complementarity to boost diagnostic accuracy and
robustness. A dynamic decision mechanism is then applied that omics data are
incrementally introduced for each patient until either all data sources are
utilized or the model confidence exceeds a predefined threshold, potentially
before all data sources are utilized. Results and Conclusion: We evaluate our
approach on four benchmark multi-omics datasets, ROSMAP, LGG, BRCA, and KIPAN.
In three datasets, over 50% of cases achieved accurate classification using a
single omics modality, effectively reducing redundant testing. Meanwhile, our
method maintains diagnostic performance comparable to full-omics models and
preserves essential biological insights.

Conclusion: 研究结果为政策制定者和电网运营商提供了实用见解，帮助在数据稀缺且不稳定的地区进行主动负荷管理和资源规划。

Abstract: Accurate electricity forecasting is crucial for grid stability and energy
planning, especially in Benghazi, Libya, where frequent load shedding,
generation deficits, and infrastructure limitations persist. This study
proposes a data-driven approach to forecast electricity load, generation, and
deficits for 2025 using historical data from 2019 (a year marked by
instability) and 2023 (a more stable year). Multiple time series models were
applied, including ARIMA, seasonal ARIMA, dynamic regression ARIMA, exponential
smoothing, extreme gradient boosting, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks. The dataset was enhanced through missing value imputation, outlier
smoothing, and log transformation. Performance was assessed using mean squared
error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute
percentage error. LSTM outperformed all other models, showing strong
capabilities in modeling non-stationary and seasonal patterns. A key
contribution of this work is an optimized LSTM framework that integrates
exogenous factors such as temperature and humidity, offering robust performance
in forecasting multiple electricity indicators. These results provide practical
insights for policymakers and grid operators to enable proactive load
management and resource planning in data-scarce, volatile regions.

Abstract: The incessant advent of online services demands high speed and efficient
recommender systems (ReS) that can maintain real-time performance along with
processing very complex user-item interactions. The present study, therefore,
considers computational bottlenecks involved in hybrid Graph Neural Network
(GNN) and Large Language Model (LLM)-based ReS with the aim optimizing their
inference latency and training efficiency. An extensive methodology was used:
hybrid GNN-LLM integrated architecture-optimization strategies(quantization,
LoRA, distillation)-hardware acceleration (FPGA, DeepSpeed)-all under R 4.4.2.
Experimental improvements were significant, with the optimal Hybrid + FPGA +
DeepSpeed configuration reaching 13.6% more accuracy (NDCG@10: 0.75) at 40-60ms
of latency, while LoRA brought down training time by 66% (3.8 hours) in
comparison to the non-optimized baseline. Irrespective of domain, such as
accuracy or efficiency, it can be established that hardware-software co-design
and parameter-efficient tuning permit hybrid models to outperform GNN or LLM
approaches implemented independently. It recommends the use of FPGA as well as
LoRA for real-time deployment. Future work should involve federated learning
along with advanced fusion architectures for better scalability and privacy
preservation. Thus, this research marks the fundamental groundwork concerning
next-generation ReS balancing low-latency response with cutting-edge
personalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FSTA的分解技术，结合L2Seg神经网络框架，显著加速了车辆路径问题（VRP）的迭代求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迭代搜索启发式算法在解决VRP时存在大量冗余计算，因为解的大部分在迭代中保持稳定。

Method: 提出FSTA技术保留稳定解段，将节点聚合为超节点，并引入L2Seg神经网络框架智能识别稳定与不稳定部分。

Result: 实验表明，L2Seg将最先进迭代求解器的速度提升高达7倍。

Conclusion: L2Seg是一个灵活框架，兼容多种求解器，并在多种VRP中表现优异。

Abstract: Iterative search heuristics are widely recognized as state-of-the-art for
solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). In this work, we identify and exploit
a critical observation: within these solvers, a large portion of the solution
remains stable, i.e., unchanged across search iterations, causing redundant
computations, especially for large-scale VRPs with long subtours. To address
this, we pioneer the formal study of the First-Segment-Then-Aggregate (FSTA)
decomposition technique to accelerate iterative solvers. Specifically, FSTA
preserves stable solution segments during the search, aggregates nodes within
each segment into fixed hypernodes, and focuses the search only on unstable
portions. Yet, a key challenge lies in identifying which segments should be
aggregated by FSTA. To this end, we then introduce Learning-to-Segment (L2Seg),
a novel neural framework to intelligently differentiate potentially stable and
unstable portions for FSTA decomposition. We present three L2Seg variants:
non-autoregressive (globally comprehensive but locally indiscriminate),
autoregressive (locally refined but globally deficient), and their synergy,
with bespoke training and inference strategies. Empirical results on CVRP and
VRPTW suggest that L2Seg accelerates state-of-the-art iterative solvers by up
to 7x. Additionally, we provide in-depth analysis showing NAR and AR synergy
achieves best performance by combining their complementary strengths. Notably,
L2Seg is a flexible framework that is compatible with traditional,
learning-based, and hybrid solvers, while supporting a broad class of VRPs.

Method: 使用PPO算法替换DQN框架，在CartPole-v1环境中进行训练和评估。

Result: PPO训练的模糊控制器在CartPole-v1中达到500 +/- 0的平均回报，方差更小且收敛更快。

Conclusion: PPO为训练可解释的神经模糊控制器提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for training neuro-fuzzy
controllers using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Building on prior work
that applied Deep Q-Learning to Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS),
our method replaces the off-policy value-based framework with a stable
on-policy actor-critic loop. We evaluate this approach in the CartPole-v1
environment using multiple random seeds and compare its learning performance
against ANFIS-Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines. It was found that PPO-trained
fuzzy agents achieved a mean return of 500 +/- 0 on CartPole-v1 after 20000
updates, showcasing less variance than prior DQN-based methods during training
and overall faster convergence. These findings suggest that PPO offers a
promising pathway for training explainable neuro-fuzzy controllers in
reinforcement learning tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的算法在计算效率和性能上优于现有基准，适用于动态边缘网络。

Abstract: Split learning (SL) has emerged as a computationally efficient approach for
artificial intelligence (AI) model training, which can alleviate device-side
computational workloads. However, complex AI model architectures pose high
computational complexity to obtain the optimal model splitting. In this paper,
we represent an arbitrary AI model as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then
reformulate the optimal model splitting problem as a minimum s-t cut search
problem. To solve the problem, we propose a fast DAG-based model splitting
algorithm, which restructures the DAG to enable the optimal model splitting
identification via a maximum flow method. Theoretical analysis indicates that
the proposed algorithm is optimal. Furthermore, considering AI models with
block structures, we propose a block-wise model splitting algorithm to reduce
computational complexity. The algorithm abstracts each block, i.e., a component
consisting of multiple layers, into a single vertex, thereby obtaining the
optimal model splitting via a simplified DAG. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can determine the optimal model
splitting within milliseconds, as well as reduce training delay by
24.62%-38.95% in dynamic edge networks as compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 动态架构调整方法具有鲁棒性和适应性，为神经网络设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: The issue of data-driven neural network model construction is one of the core
problems in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. A standard approach assumes
a fixed architecture with trainable weights. A conceptually more advanced
assumption is that we not only train the weights, but also find out the optimal
model architecture. We present a new method that realizes just that. This
article is an extended version of our conference paper titled "Dynamic Growing
and Shrinking of Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Tree Search [26]". In the
paper, we show in detail how to create a neural network with a procedure that
allows dynamic shrinking and growing of the model while it is being trained.
The decision-making mechanism for the architectural design is governed by a
Monte Carlo tree search procedure which simulates network behavior and allows
to compare several candidate architecture changes to choose the best one. The
proposed method was validated using both visual and time series datasets,
demonstrating its particular effectiveness in multivariate time series
classification. This is attributed to the architecture's ability to adapt
dynamically, allowing independent modifications for each time series. The
approach is supplemented by Python source code for reproducibility.
Experimental evaluations in visual pattern and multivariate time series
classification tasks revealed highly promising performance, underscoring the
method's robustness and adaptability.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法依赖同质数据集和静态定制模型，限制了其在多样化临床环境和采集协议中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用Transformer架构和生成式掩码预训练策略，整合多模态数据（包括MIMIC-III-WDB、MIMIC-IV-ECG和CODE数据集），预训练模型。

Result: CSFM在诊断任务、人口统计信息识别、生命体征测量、临床结果预测和ECG问答中表现优于传统单模态单任务方法，且在不同ECG导联配置和传感器模态下均表现稳健。

Conclusion: CSFM作为一种多功能、可扩展的解决方案，具有广泛的心脏监测潜力。

Abstract: Cardiac biosignals, such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and photoplethysmograms
(PPG), are of paramount importance for the diagnosis, prevention, and
management of cardiovascular diseases, and have been extensively used in a
variety of clinical tasks. Conventional deep learning approaches for analyzing
these signals typically rely on homogeneous datasets and static bespoke models,
limiting their robustness and generalizability across diverse clinical settings
and acquisition protocols. In this study, we present a cardiac sensing
foundation model (CSFM) that leverages advanced transformer architectures and a
generative, masked pretraining strategy to learn unified representations from
vast, heterogeneous health records. Our model is pretrained on an innovative
multi-modal integration of data from multiple large-scale datasets (including
MIMIC-III-WDB, MIMIC-IV-ECG, and CODE), comprising cardiac signals and the
corresponding clinical or machine-generated text reports from approximately 1.7
million individuals. We demonstrate that the embeddings derived from our CSFM
not only serve as effective feature extractors across diverse cardiac sensing
scenarios, but also enable seamless transfer learning across varying input
configurations and sensor modalities. Extensive evaluations across diagnostic
tasks, demographic information recognition, vital sign measurement, clinical
outcome prediction, and ECG question answering reveal that CSFM consistently
outperforms traditional one-modal-one-task approaches. Notably, CSFM exhibits
robust performance across multiple ECG lead configurations from standard
12-lead systems to single-lead setups, and in scenarios where only ECG, only
PPG, or a combination thereof is available. These findings highlight the
potential of CSFM as a versatile and scalable solution, for comprehensive
cardiac monitoring.

Motivation: 当前数字孪生技术缺乏清晰的信息交换框架、实时实现的关键特性以及对模型不确定性的关注。

Method: 提出VDT框架，在标准神经网络架构中增加贝叶斯输出层，并设计轻量级更新算法。

Conclusion: VDT通过贝叶斯增强和高效更新，将传统代理模型转化为不确定性感知、数据高效且计算可行的数字孪生。

Abstract: While digital twins (DT) hold promise for providing real-time insights into
complex energy assets, much of the current literature either does not offer a
clear framework for information exchange between the model and the asset, lacks
key features needed for real-time implementation, or gives limited attention to
model uncertainty. Here, we aim to solve these gaps by proposing a variational
digital twin (VDT) framework that augments standard neural architectures with a
single Bayesian output layer. This lightweight addition, along with a novel VDT
updating algorithm, lets a twin update in seconds on commodity GPUs while
producing calibrated uncertainty bounds that can inform experiment design,
control algorithms, and model reliability. The VDT is evaluated on four
energy-sector problems. For critical-heat-flux prediction, uncertainty-driven
active learning reaches R2 = 0.98 using 47 % fewer experiments and one-third
the training time of random sampling. A three-year renewable-generation twin
maintains R2 > 0.95 for solar output and curbs error growth for volatile wind
forecasts via monthly updates that process only one month of data at a time. A
nuclear reactor transient cooldown twin reconstructs thermocouple signals with
R2 > 0.99 and preserves accuracy after 50 % sensor loss, demonstrating
robustness to degraded instrumentation. Finally, a physics-informed Li-ion
battery twin, retrained after every ten discharges, lowers voltage mean-squared
error by an order of magnitude relative to the best static model while adapting
its credible intervals as the cell approaches end-of-life. These results
demonstrate that combining modest Bayesian augmentation with efficient update
schemes turns conventional surrogates into uncertainty-aware, data-efficient,
and computationally tractable DTs, paving the way for dependable models across
industrial and scientific energy systems.

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of toxic content on social media poses a serious
threat to both online environments and public discourse, highlighting the
urgent need for detoxification methods that effectively remove toxicity while
preserving the original semantics. However, existing approaches often struggle
to simultaneously achieve strong detoxification performance, semantic
preservation, and robustness to out-of-distribution data. Moreover, they
typically rely on costly, manually annotated parallel corpora while showing
poor data efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage
training framework that jointly optimizes for data efficiency, semantic
preservation, and model generalization. We first perform supervised fine-tuning
on a small set of high-quality, filtered parallel data to establish a strong
initialization. Then, we leverage unlabeled toxic inputs and a custom-designed
reward model to train the LLM using Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the
trade-offs faced by previous work, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
improved generalization and significantly reduced dependence on annotated data.

Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence
memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves
exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon
earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal
kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient
sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the
successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential
retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high
dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between
even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has
applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient
long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal
bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our
model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in
long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language
processing, forecasting, and beyond.

Result: 预训练显著加速收敛（最高4.2倍），提升准确性和表示质量，多模态性能随数据集规模扩大而优势更明显。

Conclusion: 为材料科学提供了一种无需结构输入、基于实验数据的通用模型路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based
models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for
computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world
applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain.
We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental
composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities
in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our
architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention
fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We
present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as
self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence
(up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We
further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with
dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data
regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally
grounded foundation models for materials science.

Conclusion: 需采取防洪措施（如改进排水系统、使用抗洪材料）以增强路面抗灾能力。

Abstract: Flooding can damage pavement infrastructure significantly, causing both
immediate and long-term structural and functional issues. This research
investigates how flooding events affect pavement deterioration, specifically
focusing on measuring pavement roughness by the International Roughness Index
(IRI). To quantify these effects, we utilized 20 years of pavement condition
data from TxDOT's PMIS database, which is integrated with flood event data,
including duration and spatial extent. Statistical analyses were performed to
compare IRI values before and after flooding and to calculate the deterioration
rates influenced by flood exposure. Moreover, we applied Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), to assess the impact of
flooding on pavement performance. The results demonstrate that flood-affected
pavements experience a more rapid increase in roughness compared to non-flooded
sections. These findings emphasize the need for proactive flood mitigation
strategies, including improved drainage systems, flood-resistant materials, and
preventative maintenance, to enhance pavement resilience in vulnerable regions.

TL;DR: 本文优化了一种最先进的基础模型，用于预测高性能机器学习服务中罕见且突发的生产中断，并与经典随机预测模型进行了比较，发现基础模型在特定场景下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在时间序列预测中表现出色，但尚未用于预测罕见且突发的事件，这是极端事件中的一种特殊情况。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 优化了一种最先进的基础模型，并与经典随机预测模型（如移动平均和自回归模型）进行比较，分析其在预测罕见事件中的表现。

Result: 基础模型在预测罕见事件时表现优于经典随机模型，能够更准确地捕捉目标数据中的关键模式，并在特定根因的年统计预测中误差低于6%。

Conclusion: 基础模型在预测罕见且突发的事件中具有潜力，尤其是在高性能机器学习服务的生产中断预测中表现优异。

Abstract: Time series forecasting models have diverse real world applications (e.g.,
from electricity metrics to software workload). Latest foundational models
trained for time series forecasting show strengths (e.g., for long sequences
and in zero-shot settings). However, foundational model was not yet used for
forecasting rare, spiky events, i.e., a challenging target because those are a
corner case of extreme events. In this paper, we optimize a state-of-the-art
foundational model to forecast sporadic or spiky production outages of
high-performance machine learning services powering billions of client devices.
We evaluate the forecasting errors of the foundational model compared with
classical stochastic forecasting models (e.g., moving average and
autoregressive). The analysis helps us understand how each of the evaluated
models performs for the sporadic or spiky events. For example, it identifies
the key patterns in the target data that are well tracked by the foundational
model vs. each of the stochastic models. We use the models with optimal
parameters to estimate a year-long outage statistics of a particular root cause
with less than 6% value errors.

Abstract: This study leverages an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) dataset to develop
explainable AI methods for the early detection and prediction of Freezing of
Gait (FOG), a common symptom in Parkinson's disease. Machine learning models,
including CatBoost, XGBoost, and Extra Trees classifiers, are employed to
accurately categorize FOG episodes based on relevant clinical features. A
Stacking Ensemble model achieves superior performance, surpassing a hybrid
bidirectional GRU model and reaching nearly 99% classification accuracy. SHAP
interpretability analysis reveals that time (seconds) is the most influential
factor in distinguishing gait patterns. Additionally, the proposed FOG
prediction framework incorporates federated learning, where models are trained
locally on individual devices and aggregated on a central server using a
federated averaging approach, utilizing a hybrid Conv1D + LSTM architecture for

Motivation: 传统图表示难以有效编码分子的3D空间结构，现有方法在泛化性和计算成本上存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种基于旋转采样的3D编码模块，结合SO(3)旋转群计算和后对齐策略，实现近似和严格旋转不变性。

Result: 在QM9和C10数据集上表现出优于现有方法的预测准确性、鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为药物发现和材料设计中的3D分子信息处理提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in molecular
property prediction. However, traditional graph representations struggle to
effectively encode the inherent 3D spatial structures of molecules, as
molecular orientations in 3D space introduce significant variability, severely
limiting model generalization and robustness. Existing approaches primarily
focus on rotation-invariant and rotation-equivariant methods. Invariant methods
often rely heavily on prior knowledge and lack sufficient generalizability,
while equivariant methods suffer from high computational costs. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a novel plug-and-play 3D encoding module
leveraging rotational sampling. By computing the expectation over the SO(3)
rotational group, the method naturally achieves approximate rotational
invariance. Furthermore, by introducing a carefully designed post-alignment
strategy, strict invariance can be achieved without compromising performance.
Experimental evaluations on the QM9 and C10 Datasets demonstrate superior
predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization performance compared to
existing methods. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains low computational
complexity and enhanced interpretability, providing a promising direction for
efficient and effective handling of 3D molecular information in drug discovery
and material design.

Abstract: As the demand for large scale AI models continues to grow, the optimization
of their training to balance computational efficiency, execution time, accuracy
and energy consumption represents a critical multidimensional challenge.
Achieving this balance requires not only innovative algorithmic techniques and
hardware architectures but also comprehensive tools for monitoring, analyzing,
and understanding the underlying processes involved in model training and
deployment. Provenance data information about the origins, context, and
transformations of data and processes has become a key component in this
pursuit. By leveraging provenance, researchers and engineers can gain insights
into resource usage patterns, identify inefficiencies, and ensure
reproducibility and accountability in AI development workflows. For this
reason, the question of how distributed resources can be optimally utilized to
scale large AI models in an energy efficient manner is a fundamental one. To
support this effort, we introduce the yProv4ML library, a tool designed to
collect provenance data in JSON format, compliant with the W3C PROV and ProvML
standards. yProv4ML focuses on flexibility and extensibility, and enables users
to integrate additional data collection tools via plugins. The library is fully
integrated with the yProv framework, allowing for higher level pairing in tasks
run also through workflow management systems.

Motivation: 在汽车通信系统等专业领域中，传统的异常检测方法（如监督或聚类）效果有限，且缺乏针对ECU通信的LLM模型。此外，标签数据的不一致性增加了检测的复杂性。

Method: 使用解码器LLM从UDP通信日志中学习，将异常检测简化为识别时间偏差。引入熵正则化技术，提高模型对已知异常的识别能力。

Result: 提出了一种新的解码器异常检测架构，解决了标签不一致问题，并开发了适用于不同ECU通信场景的LLM模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式模型减少了手动标注的高成本和错误率，提升了复杂通信环境中的检测准确性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection often relies on supervised or clustering approaches, with
limited success in specialized domains like automotive communication systems
where scalable solutions are essential. We propose a novel decoder-only Large
Language Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
communication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs
tailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth
data. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection
simply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an
entropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known
anomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution
offers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to
handle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU
communication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of
decoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost
and error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that
is able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection
accuracy in complex communication environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of interest in large language models (LLMs) reflects their
potential for flexibility and generalization, and attracted the attention of a
diverse range of researchers. However, the advent of these techniques has also
brought to light the lack of transparency and rigor with which development is
pursued. In particular, the inability to determine the number of epochs and
other hyperparameters in advance presents challenges in identifying the best
model. To address this challenge, machine learning frameworks such as MLFlow
can automate the collection of this type of information. However, these tools
capture data using proprietary formats and pose little attention to lineage.
This paper proposes yProv4ML, a framework to capture provenance information
generated during machine learning processes in PROV-JSON format, with minimal
code modifications.

Motivation: 解决急诊分诊中的错误（如分诊不足或过度），利用AI提升分诊准确性和效率。

Method: 回顾性分析7个月的急诊患者数据，训练并验证三种AI模型（NLP、LLM、JEPA），评估其与FRENCH标准的吻合度。

Result: LLM模型表现最佳（综合得分2.514），优于JEPA（0.438）和NLP（-3.511），且预测住院需求（GEMSA）效果显著。

Conclusion: AI（尤其是LLM）可提升急诊分诊准确性，但需解决模型局限性和伦理问题。

Abstract: Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent
challenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and
staff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage
protocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI
models [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and
Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes
against the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective
analysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage
data over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).
Three AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)
URGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic
details, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on
the FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of
AI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks
to various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM
model (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared
to JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse
triage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
URGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness
with structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for
FRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient
representations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested
models. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and
operational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires
addressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.

Motivation: 探讨SGD训练下EDLN模型如何学习到“完美”柏拉图表示，并揭示其与渐进锐化的共同机制，以理解SGD训练中的“熵力”作用。

Method: 通过分析EDLN模型在SGD训练下的行为，证明不同宽度和深度的网络会学习到相同的表示（仅旋转差异），并探讨PRH被破坏的六种方式。

Result: SGD仅找到完美柏拉图解，且柏拉图表示的出现与渐进锐化有共同原因。

Conclusion: 研究强调了理解SGD训练中“熵力”对表示学习的重要性，并揭示了两种看似无关现象的潜在联系。

Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin
et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the
embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD,
two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will
become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will
learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global
minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly
Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six
ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence
of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of
progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated
phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the
theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic
forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in
representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid
lengthy technical details.

Result: “scale-then-privatize”方法在理论行为和实证表现上优于其他变体。

Conclusion: “scale-then-privatize”是一种更优的解决方案，其噪声添加方式更符合实际需求。

Abstract: The spherical noise added to gradients in differentially private (DP)
training undermines the performance of adaptive optimizers like AdaGrad and
Adam, and hence many recent works have proposed algorithms to address this
challenge. However, the empirical results in these works focus on simple tasks
and models and the conclusions may not generalize to model training in
practice. In this paper we survey several of these variants, and develop better
theoretical intuition for them as well as perform empirical studies comparing
them. We find that a common intuition of aiming for unbiased estimates of
second moments of gradients in adaptive optimizers is misguided, and instead
that a simple technique called scale-then-privatize (which does not achieve
unbiased second moments) has more desirable theoretical behaviors and
outperforms all other variants we study on a small-scale language model
training task. We additionally argue that scale-then-privatize causes the noise
addition to better match the application of correlated noise mechanisms which
are more desirable to use in practice.

Conclusion: TDNs作为一种即插即用的替代方案，为SO(3)-等变网络提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariant networks are the dominant models for machine
learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). The key operation of such networks is
the Clebsch-Gordan (CG) tensor product, which is computationally expensive. To
accelerate the computation, we develop tensor decomposition networks (TDNs) as
a class of approximately equivariant networks whose CG tensor products are
replaced by low-rank tensor decompositions, such as the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)
decomposition. With the CP decomposition, we prove (i) a uniform bound on the
induced error of $\rm{SO}(3)$-equivariance, and (ii) the universality of
approximating any equivariant bilinear map. To further reduce the number of
parameters, we propose path-weight sharing that ties all multiplicity-space
weights across the $O(L^3)$ CG paths into a single path without compromising
equivariance, where $L$ is the maximum angular degree. The resulting layer acts
as a plug-and-play replacement for tensor products in existing networks, and
the computational complexity of tensor products is reduced from $O(L^6)$ to
$O(L^4)$. We evaluate TDNs on PubChemQCR, a newly curated molecular relaxation
dataset containing 105 million DFT-calculated snapshots. We also use existing
datasets, including OC20, and OC22. Results show that TDNs achieve competitive
performance with dramatic speedup in computations.

Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often
face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences
focus on specific target value ranges representing the most scientifically
valuable cases; we observe a significant lack of research. In this paper, we
present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach for addressing
this imbalanced regression challenge on graph-structured data by generating
synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on
often underrepresented target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail
in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or
do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average
target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on
chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent
improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.

Conclusion: FlashDP为高效且隐私保护的LLM训练提供了重要进展，代码已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly underpin technological
advancements, the privacy of their training data emerges as a critical concern.
Differential Privacy (DP) serves as a rigorous mechanism to protect this data,
yet its integration via Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent
(DP-SGD) introduces substantial challenges, primarily due to the complexities
of per-sample gradient clipping. Current explicit methods, such as Opacus,
necessitate extensive storage for per-sample gradients, significantly inflating
memory requirements. Conversely, implicit methods like GhostClip reduce storage
needs by recalculating gradients multiple times, which leads to inefficiencies
due to redundant computations. This paper introduces FlashDP, an innovative
cache-friendly per-layer DP-SGD that consolidates necessary operations into a
single task, calculating gradients only once in a fused manner. This approach
not only diminishes memory movement by up to \textbf{50\%} but also cuts down
redundant computations by \textbf{20\%}, compared to previous methods.
Consequently, FlashDP does not increase memory demands and achieves a
\textbf{90\%} throughput compared to the Non-DP method on a four-A100 system
during the pre-training of the Llama-13B model, while maintaining parity with
standard per-layer clipped DP-SGD in terms of accuracy. These advancements
establish FlashDP as a pivotal development for efficient and privacy-preserving
training of LLMs. FlashDP's code has been open-sourced in

that can be faithfully portrayed in low-dimensional settings. However, existing
resources for explaining diffusion either require an advanced theoretical
foundation or focus on their neural network architectures rather than their
rich geometric properties. We introduce Diffusion Explorer, an interactive tool
to explain the geometric properties of diffusion models. Users can train 2D
diffusion models in the browser and observe the temporal dynamics of their
sampling process. Diffusion Explorer leverages interactive animation, which has
been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of dynamic
systems, making it well suited to explaining diffusion models which represent
stochastic processes that evolve over time. Diffusion Explorer is open source

Abstract: Foundation Models have demonstrated significant success across various
domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), yet their capabilities for brainwave
modeling remain unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate current
Large Brainwave Foundation Models (LBMs) through systematic fine-tuning
experiments across multiple Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) benchmark tasks,
including memory tasks and sleep stage classification. Our extensive analysis
shows that state-of-the-art LBMs achieve only marginal improvements (0.9%-1.2%)
over traditional deep architectures while requiring significantly more
parameters (millions vs thousands), raising important questions about their
efficiency and applicability in BCI contexts. Moreover, through detailed
ablation studies and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we significantly reduce
trainable parameters without performance degradation, while demonstrating that
architectural and training inefficiencies limit LBMs' current capabilities. Our
experiments span both full model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation
techniques, providing insights into optimal training strategies for BCI
applications. We pioneer the application of LoRA to LBMs, revealing that
performance benefits generally emerge when adapting multiple neural network
components simultaneously. These findings highlight the critical need for
domain-specific development strategies to advance LBMs, suggesting that current
architectures may require redesign to fully leverage the potential of
foundation models in brainwave analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to knowledge transfer in model-based
reinforcement learning, addressing the critical challenge of deploying large
world models in resource-constrained environments. Our method efficiently
distills a high-capacity multi-task agent (317M parameters) into a compact
model (1M parameters) on the MT30 benchmark, significantly improving
performance across diverse tasks. Our distilled model achieves a
state-of-the-art normalized score of 28.45, surpassing the original 1M
parameter model score of 18.93. This improvement demonstrates the ability of
our distillation technique to capture and consolidate complex multi-task
knowledge. We further optimize the distilled model through FP16 post-training
quantization, reducing its size by $\sim$50\%. Our approach addresses practical
deployment limitations and offers insights into knowledge representation in
large world models, paving the way for more efficient and accessible multi-task

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种联合自动编码器调制器（JAM）框架，用于优化独立训练的视觉和语言模型之间的表示对齐，通过多目标优化实现模态间的共享结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索独立训练的视觉和语言模型是否可以通过优化实现表示的共享结构，验证柏拉图表示假说。

Method: 引入JAM框架，联合训练模态特定的自动编码器，结合重构和跨模态目标，实现对齐。

Result: 实验表明，JAM框架能有效诱导对齐，即使是在冻结的独立训练表示上。

Conclusion: 该框架为将通用单模态基础模型转化为专业多模态模型提供了理论和实践路径。

Abstract: Independently trained vision and language models inhabit disjoint
representational spaces, shaped by their respective modalities, objectives, and
architectures. Yet an emerging hypothesis - the Platonic Representation
Hypothesis - suggests that such models may nonetheless converge toward a shared
statistical model of reality. This compatibility, if it exists, raises a
fundamental question: can we move beyond post-hoc statistical detection of
alignment and explicitly optimize for it between such disjoint representations?
We cast this Platonic alignment problem as a multi-objective optimization task
- preserve each modality's native structure while aligning for mutual
coherence. We introduce the Joint Autoencoder Modulator (JAM) framework that
jointly trains modality-specific autoencoders on the latent representations of
pre-trained single modality models, encouraging alignment through both
reconstruction and cross-modal objectives. By analogy, this framework serves as
a method to escape Plato's Cave, enabling the emergence of shared structure
from disjoint inputs. We evaluate this framework across three critical design
axes: (i) the alignment objective - comparing contrastive loss (Con), its
hard-negative variant (NegCon), and our Spread loss, (ii) the layer depth at
which alignment is most effective, and (iii) the impact of foundation model
scale on representational convergence. Our findings show that our lightweight
Pareto-efficient framework reliably induces alignment, even across frozen,
independently trained representations, offering both theoretical insight and
practical pathways for transforming generalist unimodal foundations into
specialist multimodal models.

Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly connected, and in this context, automotive
Ethernet is one of the technologies that promise to provide the necessary
infrastructure for intra-vehicle communication. However, these systems are
subject to attacks that can compromise safety, including flow injection
attacks. Deep Learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are often
designed to combat this problem, but they require expensive hardware to run in

inference techniques like Distilling and Prunning for deploying IDS models on
low-cost platforms in real time. The results show that these techniques can
achieve intrusion detection times of up to 727 {\mu}s using a Raspberry Pi 4,
with AUCROC values of 0.9890.

Conclusion: PAE MobiLLM为移动设备上的LLM微调提供了一种高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by
on-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data
and the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted
methods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local
mobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation
transmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the
server. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and
efficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via
server-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and
improve computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the
server side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves
the mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring
data samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a
one-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a
single activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the
side network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive
adapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules
based on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth
labels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network
computing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Quantum computing has opened new opportunities to tackle complex machine

required in intelligent transportation systems. We explore quantum machine
learning to model complex skin conductance response (SCR) events that reflect
pedestrian stress in a virtual reality road crossing experiment. For this
purpose, Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with an eight-qubit ZZ feature
map and a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) using a Tree Tensor Network ansatz and
an eight-qubit ZZ feature map, were developed on Pennylane. The dataset
consists of SCR measurements along with features such as the response amplitude
and elapsed time, which have been categorized into amplitude-based classes. The
QSVM achieved good training accuracy, but had an overfitting problem, showing a
low test accuracy of 45% and therefore impacting the reliability of the
classification model. The QNN model reached a higher test accuracy of 55%,
making it a better classification model than the QSVM and the classic versions.

<details>

Motivation: 传统随机梯度下降（SGD）在大规模LLM训练中存在性能限制，需要更高效的优化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了SGD的优势，还显著提升了LLM训练的收敛速度和可扩展性。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based descent (SGD), have long been central to training
large language models (LLMs). However, their effectiveness is increasingly
being questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical
evidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper
proposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive
sampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves
faster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability
compared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis
to adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate
subgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like
algorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key
advantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity
and non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a
detailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show
that the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the
scalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the
speed and accuracy of the optimization process.

Conclusion: PULSE协议为LMMs的遗忘技术提供了更全面的评估框架，揭示了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, unlearning techniques, which are methods for inducing a
model to "forget" previously learned information, have attracted attention as a
way to address privacy and copyright concerns in large language models (LLMs)
and large multimodal models (LMMs). While several unlearning benchmarks have
been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in
LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for
LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn
fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we
introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by
introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for
analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii)
Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then
evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal
that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired
through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during
pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data
in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same
data are split and unlearned sequentially.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Dist-FedAvg在推荐准确性上优于基线聚合技术。

Conclusion: Dist-FedAvg有效解决了传统聚合方法的局限性，同时保持了与现有联邦学习框架的无缝集成。

Abstract: Graph federated recommendation systems offer a privacy-preserving alternative
to traditional centralized recommendation architectures, which often raise
concerns about data security. While federated learning enables personalized
recommendations without exposing raw user data, existing aggregation methods
overlook the unique properties of user embeddings in this setting. Indeed,
traditional aggregation methods fail to account for their complexity and the
critical role of user similarity in recommendation effectiveness. Moreover,
evolving user interactions require adaptive aggregation while preserving the
influence of high-relevance anchor users (the primary users before expansion in
graph-based frameworks). To address these limitations, we introduce
Dist-FedAvg, a novel distance-based aggregation method designed to enhance
personalization and aggregation efficiency in graph federated learning. Our
method assigns higher aggregation weights to users with similar embeddings,
while ensuring that anchor users retain significant influence in local updates.
Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that Dist-FedAvg
consistently outperforms baseline aggregation techniques, improving
recommendation accuracy while maintaining seamless integration into existing
federated learning frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维随机控制问题因维度灾难难以解决，传统动态规划方法效率低下，需要替代方案。

Method: 通过定义NHO，将问题转化为FBSDE系统，并用神经网络参数化反馈控制和值函数梯度，通过训练网络满足PMP一致性条件。

Result: 证明了NHO在一般鞅驱动下的通用逼近能力，并分析了优化挑战。

Conclusion: NHO为高维随机控制问题提供了新的深度学习框架，具有理论支持和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Stochastic control problems in high dimensions are notoriously difficult to
solve due to the curse of dimensionality. An alternative to traditional dynamic
programming is Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), which recasts the problem
as a system of Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework for solving such problems with deep
learning by defining a \textbf{Neural Hamiltonian Operator (NHO)}. This
operator parameterizes the coupled FBSDE dynamics via neural networks that
represent the feedback control and an ansatz for the value function's spatial
gradient. We show how the optimal NHO can be found by training the underlying
networks to enforce the consistency conditions dictated by the PMP. By adopting
this operator-theoretic view, we situate the deep FBSDE method within the
rigorous language of statistical inference, framing it as a problem of learning
an unknown operator from simulated data. This perspective allows us to prove
the universal approximation capabilities of NHOs under general martingale
drivers and provides a clear lens for analyzing the significant optimization
challenges inherent to this class of models.

Result: 实验显示ICLShield防御效果显著优于现有方法（平均+26.02%），对闭源模型（如GPT-4）也有效。

Conclusion: ICLShield通过动态调整概念偏好比，有效防御后门攻击，具有广泛适应性。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models (LLMs) due to its adaptability and parameter-free nature.
However, it also introduces a critical vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where
adversaries can manipulate LLM behaviors by simply poisoning a few ICL
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the
dual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the
task-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned
demonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through
theoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,
revealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio
between the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose
ICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference
ratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL
phase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating
susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs
and tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art defense
effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing approaches (+26.02% on
average). Furthermore, our method exhibits exceptional adaptability and
defensive performance even for closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4).

Abstract: Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly
challenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of
customer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business
scenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel
Adaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that
leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for
abnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum
learning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more
challenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively
addresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD
transferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show
that our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,
attaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\%, and an
average improvement of 9.59\% in OOD transfer tests. This method provides a
superior solution for industrial deployment of anomaly detection models,
contributing to improved operational efficiency and commercial benefits.

Abstract: Effective hydrological modeling and extreme weather analysis demand
precipitation data at a kilometer-scale resolution, which is significantly
finer than the 10 km scale offered by standard global products like IMERG. To
address this, we propose the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM), a generative
framework that achieves 10x spatial super-resolution (downscaling to 1 km) and
delivers a 9x inference speedup over pixel-based diffusion models. WDM is a
conditional diffusion model that learns the learns the complex structure of
precipitation from MRMS radar data directly in the wavelet domain. By focusing
on high-frequency wavelet coefficients, it generates exceptionally realistic
and detailed 1-km precipitation fields. This wavelet-based approach produces
visually superior results with fewer artifacts than pixel-space models, and
delivers a significant gains in sampling efficiency. Our results demonstrate
that WDM provides a robust solution to the dual challenges of accuracy and
speed in geoscience super-resolution, paving the way for more reliable
hydrological forecasts.

Conclusion: DSAC-D能准确表征不同驾驶风格的多模态分布，扩散策略网络可表征多模态轨迹，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling
complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal
distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value
distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in
value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper
proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D
(Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges
of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy
representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that
can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy
entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can
accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by
generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion
model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with
dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo
testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns
multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all
9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total
average return improvement of over 10\% compared to existing mainstream
algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately
characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the
diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.

Abstract: Recently, a surrogate model was proposed that employs a factorization machine
to approximate the underlying input-output mapping of the original system, with
quantum annealing used to optimize the resulting surrogate function. Inspired
by this approach, we propose an enhanced surrogate model that incorporates
additional slack variables into both the factorization machine and its
associated Ising representation thereby unifying what was by design a two-step
process into a single, integrated step. During the training phase, the slack
variables are iteratively updated, enabling the model to account for
higher-order feature interactions. We apply the proposed method to the task of
predicting drug combination effects. Experimental results indicate that the
introduction of slack variables leads to a notable improvement of performance.
Our algorithm offers a promising approach for building efficient surrogate
models that exploit potential quantum advantages.

Abstract: We introduce a new family of toy problems that combine features of
linear-regression-style continuous in-context learning (ICL) with discrete
associative recall. We pretrain transformer models on sample traces from this
toy, specifically symbolically-labeled interleaved state observations from
randomly drawn linear deterministic dynamical systems. We study if the
transformer models can recall the state of a sequence previously seen in its
context when prompted to do so with the corresponding in-context label. Taking
a closer look at this task, it becomes clear that the model must perform two
functions: (1) identify which system's state should be recalled and apply that
system to its last seen state, and (2) continuing to apply the correct system
to predict the subsequent states. Training dynamics reveal that the first
capability emerges well into a model's training. Surprisingly, the second
capability, of continuing the prediction of a resumed sequence, develops much
earlier.
  Via out-of-distribution experiments, and a mechanistic analysis on model
weights via edge pruning, we find that next-token prediction for this toy
problem involves at least two separate mechanisms. One mechanism uses the
discrete symbolic labels to do the associative recall required to predict the
start of a resumption of a previously seen sequence. The second mechanism,
which is largely agnostic to the discrete symbolic labels, performs a
"Bayesian-style" prediction based on the previous token and the context. These
two mechanisms have different learning dynamics.
  To confirm that this multi-mechanism (manifesting as separate phase
transitions) phenomenon is not just an artifact of our toy setting, we used
OLMo training checkpoints on an ICL translation task to see a similar
phenomenon: a decisive gap in the emergence of first-task-token performance vs
second-task-token performance.

TL;DR: SPRO是一种自引导过程奖励优化框架，通过内在推导过程奖励和引入累积过程奖励与掩码步骤优势，显著提升了训练效率和测试准确性，同时避免了额外计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决过程强化学习中引入额外过程奖励模型带来的计算开销问题，并填补过程级优势估计的理论空白。

Method: 提出SPRO框架，包括从策略模型内推导过程奖励的理论证明，以及定义累积过程奖励和掩码步骤优势（MSA）。

Result: SPRO在训练效率上比GRPO高3.4倍，测试准确性提升17.5%，同时减少响应长度约1/3，保持稳定的策略熵。

Conclusion: SPRO无需额外计算开销即可实现高效的过程感知强化学习，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: Process Reinforcement Learning~(PRL) has demonstrated considerable potential
in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, introducing additional process reward models incurs substantial
computational overhead, and there is no unified theoretical framework for
process-level advantage estimation. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{S}elf-Guided \textbf{P}rocess \textbf{R}eward
\textbf{O}ptimization~(\textbf{SPRO}), a novel framework that enables
process-aware RL through two key innovations: (1) we first theoretically
demonstrate that process rewards can be derived intrinsically from the policy
model itself, and (2) we introduce well-defined cumulative process rewards and
\textbf{M}asked \textbf{S}tep \textbf{A}dvantage (\textbf{MSA}), which
facilitates rigorous step-wise action advantage estimation within shared-prompt
sampling groups. Our experimental results demonstrate that SPRO outperforms
vaniila GRPO with 3.4x higher training efficiency and a 17.5\% test accuracy
improvement. Furthermore, SPRO maintains a stable and elevated policy entropy
throughout training while reducing the average response length by approximately
$1/3$, evidencing sufficient exploration and prevention of reward hacking.
Notably, SPRO incurs no additional computational overhead compared to
outcome-supervised RL methods such as GRPO, which benefit industrial
implementation.

*Federico Nicolas Peccia,Frederik Haxel,Oliver Bringmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TVM编译器的工作流，用于高效地将AI工作负载映射到RISC-V向量单元，相比GCC自动向量化和muRISCV-NN库，性能分别提升46%和29%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RISC-V向量扩展（RVV）在AI工作负载加速中具有潜力，但缺乏智能方法（如自动调优框架）的集成，限制了高效部署。

Method: 将RVV扩展集成到TVM的MetaSchedule框架中，实现AI工作负载的自动调优，并在FPGA上实现不同RISC-V SoC进行验证。

Result: 相比GCC自动向量化和muRISCV-NN，执行延迟分别降低46%和29%，且代码内存占用更小。在商用RISC-V SoC上，性能比LLVM提升35%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了RISC-V向量单元的效率，适合嵌入式设备，并开源以支持社区扩展。

Abstract: RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging
from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its
RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI
workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of
RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the
autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like
muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing
the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the
efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a
workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V
vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the
RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program
framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on
an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our
proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared
against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN.
Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory
footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also
evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the
RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that
are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our
proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.

TL;DR: 论文提出BAR数据集，解决博物馆环境中RSS数据缺乏的问题，并提供了基于邻近性和k-NN算法的分类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升文化遗址中室内定位系统（IPS）的性能，解决博物馆环境数据不足的挑战。

Method: 收集了90件艺术品前的RSS数据，使用Android和iOS平台，并采用邻近性和k-NN算法进行分类。

Result: 提供了BAR数据集和分析结果，为博物馆IPS开发提供基础。

Conclusion: BAR数据集填补了博物馆环境RSS数据的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) hold significant potential for enhancing
visitor experiences in cultural heritage institutions. By enabling personalized
navigation, efficient artifact organization, and better interaction with
exhibits, IPSs can transform the modalities of how individuals engage with
museums, galleries and libraries. However, these institutions face several
challenges in implementing IPSs, including environmental constraints, technical
limits, and limited experimentation. In other contexts, Received Signal
Strength (RSS)-based approaches using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi have
emerged as preferred solutions due to their non-invasive nature and minimal
infrastructure requirements. Nevertheless, the lack of publicly available RSS
datasets that specifically reflect museum environments presents a substantial
barrier to developing and evaluating positioning algorithms designed for the
intricate spatial characteristics typical of cultural heritage sites. To
address this limitation, we present BAR, a novel RSS dataset collected in front
of 90 artworks across 13 museum rooms using two different platforms, i.e.,
Android and iOS. Additionally, we provide an advanced position classification
baseline taking advantage of a proximity-based method and $k$-NN algorithms. In
our analysis, we discuss the results and offer suggestions for potential
research directions.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了强化学习中奖励频率作为任务难度衡量标准的常见假设，揭示了当前策略学习方法在关键子目标无直接奖励时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨奖励频率是否可靠衡量任务难度，并揭示当前方法在无直接奖励子目标时的不足。

Method: 方法包括形式化零激励动态问题，分析子目标完成与最终奖励的时间敏感性，并测试现有深度子目标算法的表现。

Result: 结果表明，现有算法无法有效利用零激励动态，学习性能对子目标与奖励的时间接近性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 结论指出当前方法存在根本性局限，需开发能推断潜在任务结构而不依赖即时激励的机制。

Abstract: This work re-examines the commonly held assumption that the frequency of
rewards is a reliable measure of task difficulty in reinforcement learning. We
identify and formalize a structural challenge that undermines the effectiveness
of current policy learning methods: when essential subgoals do not directly
yield rewards. We characterize such settings as exhibiting zero-incentive
dynamics, where transitions critical to success remain unrewarded. We show that
state-of-the-art deep subgoal-based algorithms fail to leverage these dynamics
and that learning performance is highly sensitive to the temporal proximity
between subgoal completion and eventual reward. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation in current approaches and point to the need for
mechanisms that can infer latent task structure without relying on immediate
incentives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）的混合方法Prefix-RFT，在数学推理任务中表现优于单独使用SFT或RFT，且易于集成到现有框架中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后训练技术（SFT和RFT）各有优缺点，SFT易导致泛化问题，RFT性能敏感且可能学习意外行为。研究旨在统一这两种方法，提升模型性能。

Method: 提出Prefix-RFT，结合演示和探索学习，通过数学推理任务验证其有效性。

Result: Prefix-RFT性能优于单独SFT和RFT，且对演示数据质量和数量具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Prefix-RFT有效统一了SFT和RFT，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly
categorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking
demonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of
behavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's
performance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is
highly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified
view of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that
synergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical
reasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is
both simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone
SFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key
advantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,
requiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis
highlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that
Prefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,
ablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality
and quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective
on LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously
integrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for
future research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models, inspiring
extensive research into their underlying mechanisms. One of the key questions
in this area is the loss functions these models shall train with. Multiple
formulations have been introduced in the literature over the past several years
with some links and some critical differences stemming from various initial
considerations. In this paper, we explore the different target objectives and
corresponding loss functions in detail. We present a systematic overview of
their relationships, unifying them under the framework of the variational lower
bound objective. We complement this theoretical analysis with an empirical
study providing insights into the conditions under which these objectives
diverge in performance and the underlying factors contributing to such
deviations. Additionally, we evaluate how the choice of objective impacts the
model ability to achieve specific goals, such as generating high-quality
samples or accurately estimating likelihoods. This study offers a unified
understanding of loss functions in diffusion models, contributing to more
efficient and goal-oriented model designs in future research.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning can play a key role in addressing sustainable
energy challenges. For instance, many grid systems are heavily congested,
highlighting the urgent need to enhance operational efficiency. However,
reinforcement learning approaches have traditionally been slow due to the high
sample complexity and expensive simulation requirements. While recent works
have effectively used GPUs to accelerate data generation by converting
environments to JAX, these works have largely focussed on classical toy
problems. This paper introduces Chargax, a JAX-based environment for realistic
simulation of electric vehicle charging stations designed for accelerated
training of RL agents. We validate our environment in a variety of scenarios
based on real data, comparing reinforcement learning agents against baselines.
Chargax delivers substantial computational performance improvements of over
100x-1000x over existing environments. Additionally, Chargax' modular
architecture enables the representation of diverse real-world charging station
configurations.

Result: 实验证明BBoxER在LLM上能提升性能并泛化良好。

Conclusion: BBoxER是梯度优化的有效补充，适用于隐私敏感环境。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization is the workhorse of deep learning, offering
efficient and scalable training via backpropagation. However, its reliance on
large volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as
susceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In
contrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque
function, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a
promising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial
risks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also
pose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional
parameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high
computational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper
introduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that
induces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training
data. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong
theoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to
data poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates
on top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement
suitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in
addition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we
demonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing
how a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a
benchmark of reasoning datasets. This positions BBoxER as an attractive add-on
on top of gradient-based optimization.

Conclusion: MARVIS提供了一种无需训练、保护隐私的多模态预测解决方案，性能接近专业方法。

Abstract: Scientific applications of machine learning often rely on small, specialized
models tuned to particular domains. Such models often achieve excellent
performance, but lack flexibility. Foundation models offer versatility, but
typically underperform specialized approaches, especially on non-traditional
modalities and long-tail domains. We propose MARVIS (Modality Adaptive
Reasoning over VISualizations), a training-free method that enables even small
vision-language models to predict any data modality with high accuracy. MARVIS
transforms latent embedding spaces into visual representations and then
leverages the spatial and fine-grained reasoning skills of VLMs to successfully
interpret and utilize them. MARVIS achieves competitive performance on vision,
audio, biological, and tabular domains using a single 3B parameter model,
achieving results that beat Gemini by 16\% on average and approach specialized
methods, without exposing personally identifiable information (P.I.I.) or
requiring any domain-specific training. We open source our code and datasets at

Abstract: Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) have transformed the fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling parameter-efficient updates. However, their
widespread adoption remains limited by the reliance on GPU-based training. In
this work, we propose a theoretically grounded approach to LoRA fine-tuning
designed specifically for users with limited computational resources,
particularly those restricted to standard laptop CPUs. Our method learns a
meta-operator that maps any input dataset, represented as a probability
distribution, to a set of LoRA weights by leveraging a large bank of
pre-trained adapters for the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 model. Instead of
performing new gradient-based updates, our pipeline constructs adapters via
lightweight combinations of existing LoRAs directly on CPU. While the resulting
adapters do not match the performance of GPU-trained counterparts, they
consistently outperform the base Mistral model on downstream tasks, offering a
practical and accessible alternative to traditional GPU-based fine-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce our first reflective generative model MetaStone-S1, which
obtains OpenAI o3's performance via the self-supervised process reward model

next token prediction and process scoring respectively, SPRM successfully
integrates the policy model and process reward model(PRM) into a unified
interface without extra process annotation, reducing over 99% PRM parameters
for efficient reasoning. Equipped with SPRM, MetaStone-S1 is naturally suitable
for test time scaling (TTS), and we provide three reasoning effort modes (low,
medium, and high), based on the controllable thinking length. Moreover, we
empirically establish a scaling law that reveals the relationship between total
thinking computation and TTS performance. Experiments demonstrate that our
MetaStone-S1 achieves comparable performance to OpenAI-o3-mini's series with

Motivation: 尽管zapping在持续学习中表现出有效性，但其背后的机制尚不明确，因此研究其在卷积神经网络中的具体作用。

Method: 在持续学习和少样本迁移学习场景下，通过手写字符和自然图像实验，分析zapping对模型学习和遗忘模式的影响。

Result: 实验表明，zapping能加速模型在新领域的恢复，同时优化器的选择会显著影响任务间的学习与遗忘动态。

Conclusion: zapping和优化器选择共同塑造了持续学习中的复杂动态，揭示了任务间协同/干扰的模式。

Abstract: Recent work in continual learning has highlighted the beneficial effect of
resampling weights in the last layer of a neural network (``zapping"). Although
empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, the
underlying mechanisms that drive these improvements remain unclear. In this
work, we investigate in detail the pattern of learning and forgetting that take
place inside a convolutional neural network when trained in challenging
settings such as continual learning and few-shot transfer learning, with
handwritten characters and natural images. Our experiments show that models
that have undergone zapping during training more quickly recover from the shock
of transferring to a new domain. Furthermore, to better observe the effect of
continual learning in a multi-task setting we measure how each individual task
is affected. This shows that, not only zapping, but the choice of optimizer can
also deeply affect the dynamics of learning and forgetting, causing complex
patterns of synergy/interference between tasks to emerge when the model learns
sequentially at transfer time.

Abstract: Location information serves as the fundamental element for numerous Internet
of Things (IoT) applications. Traditional indoor localization techniques often
produce significant errors and raise privacy concerns due to centralized data
collection. In response, Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer promising
solutions by capturing indoor environment variations. However, they typically
require central data aggregation, leading to privacy, bandwidth, and server
reliability issues. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a
Federated Learning (FL)-based approach for dynamic indoor localization using a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. Experimental results show that FL has the
nearby performance to Centralized Model (CL) while keeping the data privacy,
bandwidth efficiency and server reliability. This research demonstrates that
our proposed FL approach provides a viable solution for privacy-enhanced indoor
localization, paving the way for advancements in secure and efficient indoor
localization systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of Muon, a new optimizer that
leverages the inherent matrix structure of neural network parameters. We
provide convergence proofs for four practical variants of Muon: with and
without Nesterov momentum, and with and without weight decay. We then show that
adding weight decay leads to strictly tighter bounds on both the parameter and

mechanism works with single samples or mini-batches and maintains low

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GradMetaNet的新架构，专门设计用于处理神经网络梯度，基于三个原则：等变性设计、多数据点梯度处理和高效梯度表示。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理梯度时未针对梯度处理专门设计架构，限制了其适用性。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 基于三个原则设计GradMetaNet：等变性设计、多数据点梯度处理和高效梯度表示（通过秩-1分解）。

Result: GradMetaNet在多种梯度任务（如优化、编辑和曲率估计）中表现优于现有方法，且能逼近自然梯度函数。

Conclusion: GradMetaNet为梯度处理提供了一种高效且通用的架构，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Gradients of neural networks encode valuable information for optimization,
editing, and analysis of models. Therefore, practitioners often treat gradients
as inputs to task-specific algorithms, e.g. for pruning or optimization. Recent
works explore learning algorithms that operate directly on gradients but use
architectures that are not specifically designed for gradient processing,
limiting their applicability. In this paper, we present a principled approach
for designing architectures that process gradients. Our approach is guided by
three principles: (1) equivariant design that preserves neuron permutation
symmetries, (2) processing sets of gradients across multiple data points to
capture curvature information, and (3) efficient gradient representation
through rank-1 decomposition. Based on these principles, we introduce
GradMetaNet, a novel architecture for learning on gradients, constructed from
simple equivariant blocks. We prove universality results for GradMetaNet, and
show that previous approaches cannot approximate natural gradient-based
functions that GradMetaNet can. We then demonstrate GradMetaNet's effectiveness
on a diverse set of gradient-based tasks on MLPs and transformers, such as
learned optimization, INR editing, and estimating loss landscape curvature.

TL;DR: AsyncFlow是一个异步流式强化学习框架，用于高效后训练，解决了传统框架的可扩展性和资源利用问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在扩展性、数据流复杂性和资源利用方面存在瓶颈，且与训练/推理引擎紧密耦合，难以支持自定义引擎。

Method: 提出分布式数据存储与传输模块，实现流式数据管理和细粒度调度；采用生产者-消费者异步工作流，减少计算闲置；架构与底层引擎解耦。

Result: 实验显示吞吐量平均提升1.59倍。

Conclusion: AsyncFlow为下一代强化学习系统设计提供了模块化和可定制的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a pivotal technology in the
post-training phase of large language models (LLMs). Traditional task-colocated
RL frameworks suffer from significant scalability bottlenecks, while
task-separated RL frameworks face challenges in complex dataflows and the
corresponding resource idling and workload imbalance. Moreover, most existing
frameworks are tightly coupled with LLM training or inference engines, making
it difficult to support custom-designed engines. To address these challenges,
we propose AsyncFlow, an asynchronous streaming RL framework for efficient
post-training. Specifically, we introduce a distributed data storage and
transfer module that provides a unified data management and fine-grained
scheduling capability in a fully streamed manner. This architecture inherently
facilitates automated pipeline overlapping among RL tasks and dynamic load
balancing. Moreover, we propose a producer-consumer-based asynchronous workflow
engineered to minimize computational idleness by strategically deferring
parameter update process within staleness thresholds. Finally, the core
capability of AsynFlow is architecturally decoupled from underlying training
and inference engines and encapsulated by service-oriented user interfaces,
offering a modular and customizable user experience. Extensive experiments
demonstrate an average of 1.59 throughput improvement compared with
state-of-the-art baseline. The presented architecture in this work provides
actionable insights for next-generation RL training system designs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SODA的算法，用于从大型语言模型（LLM）的输出中精确重构输入，解决了现有审计技术的补充性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术主要关注识别LLM的不当行为，而本文旨在解决事后分析的输入重构问题，以检测虚假输出报告。

Method: 将输入重构问题形式化为离散优化问题，提出SODA算法，通过梯度搜索和周期性重启实现高效求解。

Result: 实验表明，SODA在33M到3B参数的LLM上显著优于现有方法，成功恢复了79.5%的短输入，但对长输入（15+ token）效果有限。

Conclusion: 标准部署实践可能已足够防止恶意使用该方法，但输入重构技术仍有潜力用于事后分析。

Abstract: While existing auditing techniques attempt to identify potential unwanted
behaviours in large language models (LLMs), we address the complementary
forensic problem of reconstructing the exact input that led to an existing LLM
output - enabling post-incident analysis and potentially the detection of fake
output reports. We formalize exact input reconstruction as a discrete
optimisation problem with a unique global minimum and introduce SODA, an
efficient gradient-based algorithm that operates on a continuous relaxation of
the input search space with periodic restarts and parameter decay. Through
comprehensive experiments on LLMs ranging in size from 33M to 3B parameters, we
demonstrate that SODA significantly outperforms existing approaches. We succeed
in fully recovering 79.5% of shorter out-of-distribution inputs from next-token
logits, without a single false positive, but struggle to extract private
information from the outputs of longer (15+ token) input sequences. This
suggests that standard deployment practices may currently provide adequate
protection against malicious use of our method. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PERTINENCE是一种动态选择预训练模型的方法，通过分析输入特征复杂度，实现高效与准确性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型DNN模型资源消耗高，但仅部分复杂输入需要其能力，轻量模型可处理简单输入，需动态选择模型以提高效率。

Method: 使用遗传算法训练输入调度器，动态选择最适合的预训练模型，平衡准确性与计算效率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上，PERTINENCE减少36%计算量，保持或提升准确性。

Conclusion: PERTINENCE通过动态模型选择，显著提升效率，为资源受限场景提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous thanks to their remarkable
ability to model complex patterns across various domains such as computer
vision, speech recognition, robotics, etc. While large DNN models are often
more accurate than simpler, lightweight models, they are also resource- and
energy-hungry. Hence, it is imperative to design methods to reduce reliance on
such large models without significant degradation in output accuracy. The high
computational cost of these models is often necessary only for a reduced set of
challenging inputs, while lighter models can handle most simple ones. Thus,
carefully combining properties of existing DNN models in a dynamic, input-based
way opens opportunities to improve efficiency without impacting accuracy.
  In this work, we introduce PERTINENCE, a novel online method designed to
analyze the complexity of input features and dynamically select the most
suitable model from a pre-trained set to process a given input effectively. To
achieve this, we employ a genetic algorithm to explore the training space of an
ML-based input dispatcher, enabling convergence towards the Pareto front in the
solution space that balances overall accuracy and computational efficiency.
  We showcase our approach on state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as Vision Transformers
(ViTs) trained on TinyImageNet dataset. We report results showing PERTINENCE's
ability to provide alternative solutions to existing state-of-the-art models in
terms of trade-offs between accuracy and number of operations. By
opportunistically selecting among models trained for the same task, PERTINENCE
achieves better or comparable accuracy with up to 36% fewer operations.

Abstract: Estimation of model uncertainty can help improve the explainability of Graph
Convolutional Networks and the accuracy of the models at the same time.
Uncertainty can also be used in critical applications to verify the results of
the model by an expert or additional models. In this paper, we propose
Variational Neural Network versions of spatial and spatio-temporal Graph
Convolutional Networks. We estimate uncertainty in both outputs and layer-wise
attentions of the models, which has the potential for improving model
explainability. We showcase the benefits of these models in the social trading
analysis and the skeleton-based human action recognition tasks on the Finnish
board membership, NTU-60, NTU-120 and Kinetics datasets, where we show
improvement in model accuracy in addition to estimated model uncertainties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RelFCI的因果发现算法，适用于具有潜在混杂因素的关系数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果发现算法在处理关系数据和潜在混杂因素时存在不足，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 基于Fast Causal Inference (FCI)和Relational Causal Discovery (RCD)算法，定义了新的图形模型，并建立了关系d-分离的理论保证。

Result: 实验结果表明，RelFCI能有效识别具有潜在混杂因素的关系因果模型中的正确因果结构。

Conclusion: RelFCI填补了现有算法的空白，为关系数据中的因果发现提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Estimating causal effects from real-world relational data can be challenging
when the underlying causal model and potential confounders are unknown. While
several causal discovery algorithms exist for learning causal models with
latent confounders from data, they assume that the data is independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and are not well-suited for learning from
relational data. Similarly, existing relational causal discovery algorithms
assume causal sufficiency, which is unrealistic for many real-world datasets.
To address this gap, we propose RelFCI, a sound and complete causal discovery
algorithm for relational data with latent confounders. Our work builds upon the
Fast Causal Inference (FCI) and Relational Causal Discovery (RCD) algorithms
and it defines new graphical models, necessary to support causal discovery in
relational domains. We also establish soundness and completeness guarantees for
relational d-separation with latent confounders. We present experimental
results demonstrating the effectiveness of RelFCI in identifying the correct
causal structure in relational causal models with latent confounders.

Result: 贝叶斯PINN在基准问题上表现优于集成方法，与Adam和LBFGS结合的PINN集成效果相当。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯PINN是一种数学上更严谨的方法，能有效提升PINN在前向问题中的性能。

Abstract: Training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for forward problems often
suffers from severe convergence issues, hindering the propagation of
information from regions where the desired solution is well-defined.
Haitsiukevich and Ilin (2023) proposed an ensemble approach that extends the
active training domain of each PINN based on i) ensemble consensus and ii)
vicinity to (pseudo-)labeled points, thus ensuring that the information from
the initial condition successfully propagates to the interior of the
computational domain.
  In this work, we suggest replacing the ensemble by a Bayesian PINN, and
consensus by an evaluation of the PINN's posterior variance. Our experiments
show that this mathematically principled approach outperforms the ensemble on a
set of benchmark problems and is competitive with PINN ensembles trained with
combinations of Adam and LBFGS.

Method: 比较多保真超参数优化、固定超参数调度和无超参数学习等方法。

Result: 现有方法在复杂任务中效果下降，需关注更相关的测试任务和新方向（如可微调方法和元学习）。

Conclusion: AutoML社区需加强学习率控制研究，以提升其在深度学习中的影响力。

Abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep
learning, and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep
learning research. Approaches for learning rate control span from classic
optimization to online scheduling based on gradient statistics. This paper
compares paradigms to assess the current state of learning rate control. We
find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter optimization,
fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often perform
very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.
This highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate
control, which have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning
communities. We also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches
becoming less effective as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when
combined with multi-fidelity approaches for more expensive model trainings. A
focus on more relevant test tasks and new promising directions like finetunable
methods and meta-learning will enable the AutoML community to significantly
strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in deep learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高维参数空间中效率低且计算成本高，难以准确捕捉葡萄糖-胰岛素相互作用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在参数估计和泛化能力上优于传统方法，并提供实时后验推断。

Conclusion: 该方法为1型糖尿病模型参数估计提供了高效、可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately estimating parameters of physiological models is essential to
achieving reliable digital twins. For Type 1 Diabetes, this is particularly
challenging due to the complexity of glucose-insulin interactions. Traditional
methods based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo struggle with high-dimensional
parameter spaces and fit parameters from scratch at inference time, making them
slow and computationally expensive. In this study, we propose a
Simulation-Based Inference approach based on Neural Posterior Estimation to
efficiently capture the complex relationships between meal intake, insulin, and
glucose level, providing faster, amortized inference. Our experiments
demonstrate that SBI not only outperforms traditional methods in parameter
estimation but also generalizes better to unseen conditions, offering real-time
posterior inference with reliable uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在关键应用中的使用受到样本质量评估不可靠的限制，现有指标缺乏校准或对异常值不够鲁棒。

Method: 通过剪裁单个样本贡献和最近邻球的半径，提出Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage指标，防止异常样本影响整体评估。

Result: 实验表明，新指标在鲁棒性、敏感性和可解释性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Clipped Density和Clipped Coverage为生成模型的质量评估提供了更可靠和可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years,
their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to
reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary
concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable,
interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient
robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel
metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample
contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our
metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values.
Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear
score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can
be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of
robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.

Result: 在多类分类任务中，BranchNet准确率显著高于XGBoost。

Conclusion: BranchNet在可解释性和性能上表现优异，但在二元任务中需进一步优化。

Abstract: We introduce BranchNet, a neuro-symbolic learning framework that transforms
decision tree ensembles into sparse, partially connected neural networks. Each
branch, defined as a decision path from root to a parent of leaves, is mapped
to a hidden neuron, preserving symbolic structure while enabling gradient-based
optimization. The resulting models are compact, interpretable, and require no
manual architecture tuning. Evaluated on a suite of structured multi-class
classification benchmarks, BranchNet consistently outperforms XGBoost in
accuracy, with statistically significant gains. We detail the architecture,
training procedure, and sparsity dynamics, and discuss the model's strengths in
symbolic interpretability as well as its current limitations, particularly on
binary tasks where further adaptive calibration may be beneficial.

Method: 将k-CNF公式映射为MILP问题，编码为加权二分图后输入GNN进行训练和测试。

Result: 理论证明了方法的稳定性和局限性，实验显示该方法在简单神经网络架构下取得了有希望的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在理论上和实验上均表现出潜力，但仍存在对特定类型公式的局限性。

Abstract: We proposes a novel method that enables Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve
SAT problems by leveraging a technique developed for applying GNNs to Mixed
Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Specifically, k-CNF formulae are mapped into
MILP problems, which are then encoded as weighted bipartite graphs and
subsequently fed into a GNN for training and testing. From a theoretical
perspective: (i) we establish permutation and equivalence invariance results,
demonstrating that the method produces outputs that are stable under reordering
of clauses and variables; (ii) we identify a theoretical limitation, showing
that for a class of formulae called foldable formulae, standard GNNs cannot
always distinguish satisfiable from unsatisfiable instances; (iii) we prove a
universal approximation theorem, establishing that with Random Node
Initialization (RNI), the method can approximate SAT solving to arbitrary
precision on finite datasets, that is, the GNN becomes approximately sound and
complete on such datasets. Furthermore, we show that for unfoldable formulae,
the same approximation guarantee can be achieved without the need for RNI.
Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of our approach, which show
that, despite the simplicity of the neural architecture, the method achieves
promising results.

Motivation: 解决边缘设备在内存受限情况下处理短时和长时动态的需求，同时避免传统方法（如Transformers、RNNs和TCNs）的缺点。

Method: 提出mGRADE，结合1D卷积和minGRU，卷积层捕捉快速时间变化，循环模块维持全局上下文。

Result: 在合成任务和图像分类基准测试中，mGRADE表现优于纯卷积和纯循环模型，内存占用减少20%。

Conclusion: mGRADE是内存受限边缘设备中多尺度时间处理的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge devices for temporal processing demand models that capture both short-
and long- range dynamics under tight memory constraints. While Transformers
excel at sequence modeling, their quadratic memory scaling with sequence length
makes them impractical for such settings. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
offer constant memory but train sequentially, and Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs), though efficient, scale memory with kernel size. To address
this, we propose mGRADE (mininally Gated Recurrent Architecture with Delay
Embedding), a hybrid-memory system that integrates a temporal 1D-convolution
with learnable spacings followed by a minimal gated recurrent unit (minGRU).
This design allows the convolutional layer to realize a flexible delay
embedding that captures rapid temporal variations, while the recurrent module
efficiently maintains global context with minimal memory overhead. We validate
our approach on two synthetic tasks, demonstrating that mGRADE effectively
separates and preserves multi-scale temporal features. Furthermore, on
challenging pixel-by-pixel image classification benchmarks, mGRADE consistently
outperforms both pure convolutional and pure recurrent counterparts using
approximately 20% less memory footprint, highlighting its suitability for
memory-constrained temporal processing at the edge. This highlights mGRADE's
promise as an efficient solution for memory-constrained multi-scale temporal
processing at the edge.

Result: 研究发现，现有方法在OOD检测中存在不可减少的错误，且常见干预措施无法解决目标错位问题。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了OOD检测方法的根本问题，指出需要重新思考方法设计，以解决目标错位问题。

Abstract: To detect distribution shifts and improve model safety, many
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods rely on the predictive uncertainty
or features of supervised models trained on in-distribution data. In this
paper, we critically re-examine this popular family of OOD detection
procedures, and we argue that these methods are fundamentally answering the
wrong questions for OOD detection. There is no simple fix to this misalignment,
since a classifier trained only on in-distribution classes cannot be expected
to identify OOD points; for instance, a cat-dog classifier may confidently
misclassify an airplane if it contains features that distinguish cats from
dogs, despite generally appearing nothing alike. We find that uncertainty-based
methods incorrectly conflate high uncertainty with being OOD, while
feature-based methods incorrectly conflate far feature-space distance with
being OOD. We show how these pathologies manifest as irreducible errors in OOD
detection and identify common settings where these methods are ineffective.
Additionally, interventions to improve OOD detection such as feature-logit
hybrid methods, scaling of model and data size, epistemic uncertainty
representation, and outlier exposure also fail to address this fundamental
misalignment in objectives. We additionally consider unsupervised density
estimation and generative models for OOD detection, which we show have their
own fundamental limitations.

TL;DR: SubLoRA是一种基于子模函数最大化的低秩适应（LoRA）秩确定方法，利用二阶信息（Hessian矩阵）改进传统一阶方法的不足，并通过贪心算法实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法依赖一阶近似，在参数优化良好时可能不准确且病态，因此需要更可靠且精细的二阶方法。

Method: 将秩确定问题转化为组合优化问题，引入子模函数最大化框架和贪心算法，并结合Hessian矩阵的闭式投影。

Result: 在物理信息神经网络（PINNs）的微调实验中，SubLoRA在秩确定和联合训练性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SubLoRA结合了理论严谨性、二阶精度和计算效率，为LoRA秩确定提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SubLoRA, a rank determination method for Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) based on submodular function maximization. In contrast to
prior approaches, such as AdaLoRA, that rely on first-order (linearized)
approximations of the loss function, SubLoRA utilizes second-order information
to capture the potentially complex loss landscape by incorporating the Hessian
matrix. We show that the linearization becomes inaccurate and ill-conditioned
when the LoRA parameters have been well optimized, motivating the need for a
more reliable and nuanced second-order formulation. To this end, we reformulate
the rank determination problem as a combinatorial optimization problem with a
quadratic objective. However, solving this problem exactly is NP-hard in
general. To overcome the computational challenge, we introduce a submodular
function maximization framework and devise a greedy algorithm with
approximation guarantees. We derive a sufficient and necessary condition under
which the rank-determination objective becomes submodular, and construct a
closed-form projection of the Hessian matrix that satisfies this condition
while maintaining computational efficiency. Our method combines solid
theoretical foundations, second-order accuracy, and practical computational
efficiency. We further extend SubLoRA to a joint optimization setting,
alternating between LoRA parameter updates and rank determination under a rank
budget constraint. Extensive experiments on fine-tuning physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that SubLoRA outperforms
existing methods in both rank determination and joint training performance.

Result: 在多维时间序列数据集（包括移动ISP数据和KDD 2021数据集）上展示了初步结果。

Conclusion: FAE是一种有潜力的通用模型，适用于零样本异常检测任务。

Abstract: We investigate a novel approach to time-series modeling, inspired by the
successes of large pretrained foundation models. We introduce FAE (Foundation
Auto-Encoders), a foundation generative-AI model for anomaly detection in
time-series data, based on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). By foundation, we
mean a model pretrained on massive amounts of time-series data which can learn
complex temporal patterns useful for accurate modeling, forecasting, and
detection of anomalies on previously unseen datasets. FAE leverages VAEs and
Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to build a generic model for
univariate time-series modeling, which could eventually perform properly in
out-of-the-box, zero-shot anomaly detection applications. We introduce the main
concepts of FAE, and present preliminary results in different multi-dimensional
time-series datasets from various domains, including a real dataset from an
operational mobile ISP, and the well known KDD 2021 Anomaly Detection dataset.

Motivation: 心理健康账单的复杂性导致异常（如欺诈）频发，而传统机器学习方法在类别不平衡、标签稀缺和复杂序列模式上表现不佳。

Method: 采用混合深度学习方法，结合LSTM和Transformers，并通过iForest和AE生成伪标签。

Result: 在心理健康账单数据集上，iForest LSTM基线模型在声明级数据上召回率最高（0.963），混合iForest模型在操作级数据上召回率最高（0.744）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，伪标记与混合深度学习结合在复杂、不平衡的异常检测场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of mental healthcare billing enables anomalies, including
fraud. While machine learning methods have been applied to anomaly detection,
they often struggle with class imbalance, label scarcity, and complex
sequential patterns. This study explores a hybrid deep learning approach
combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Transformers, with
pseudo-labeling via Isolation Forests (iForest) and Autoencoders (AE). Prior
work has not evaluated such hybrid models trained on pseudo-labeled data in the
context of healthcare billing. The approach is evaluated on two real-world
billing datasets related to mental healthcare. The iForest LSTM baseline
achieves the highest recall (0.963) on declaration-level data. On the
operation-level data, the hybrid iForest-based model achieves the highest
recall (0.744), though at the cost of lower precision. These findings highlight
the potential of combining pseudo-labeling with hybrid deep learning in
complex, imbalanced anomaly detection settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出用自然语言进行意图和推理通信，以解决多智能体协同驾驶中的带宽效率、信息完整性和互操作性限制，提升安全性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通信媒介（如传感器数据、神经网络特征）在带宽效率、信息完整性和智能体互操作性方面存在不足，且忽视了决策级融合。

Method: 通过自然语言通信直接传达意图、推理和决策，实现从感知数据共享到主动协调的转变。

Result: 自然语言通信平衡了语义密度和带宽，适应实时条件，并提升智能交通系统的安全性、效率和透明度。

Conclusion: 自然语言通信是多智能体协同驾驶的有效解决方案，能显著提升交通系统的性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative driving promises improvements in traffic safety and
efficiency through collective perception and decision making. However, existing
communication media -- including raw sensor data, neural network features, and
perception results -- suffer limitations in bandwidth efficiency, information
completeness, and agent interoperability. Moreover, traditional approaches have
largely ignored decision-level fusion, neglecting critical dimensions of
collaborative driving. In this paper we argue that addressing these challenges
requires a transition from purely perception-oriented data exchanges to
explicit intent and reasoning communication using natural language. Natural
language balances semantic density and communication bandwidth, adapts flexibly
to real-time conditions, and bridges heterogeneous agent platforms. By enabling
the direct communication of intentions, rationales, and decisions, it
transforms collaborative driving from reactive perception-data sharing into
proactive coordination, advancing safety, efficiency, and transparency in
intelligent transportation systems.

Motivation: 传统MARL方法在语义通信和角色结构上存在局限性，而LLM框架缺乏在线学习能力，导致探索效果不佳。RALLY旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了LLM驱动的语义决策框架，引入动态角色异质性机制，并基于RMIX网络整合离线先验与在线策略。

Result: 在MPE和SITL平台上，RALLY在任务覆盖率、收敛速度和泛化能力上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RALLY展示了在多无人机系统中协同导航的强大潜力。

Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as
a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate
effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over
multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the
semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role
structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.
Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks
demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive
prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance
on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration,
leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To
address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked
navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven
semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient
semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a
dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and
personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing
Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors
with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection
strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE)
environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY
outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence
speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative
navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

Conclusion: 该架构有望支持复杂动态问题解决，尤其在缺乏明确结构或流程的场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose to incorporate the blackboard architecture into LLM
multi-agent systems (MASs) so that (1) agents with various roles can share all
the information and others' messages during the whole problem-solving process,
(2) agents that will take actions are selected based on the current content of
the blackboard, and (3) the selection and execution round is repeated until a
consensus is reached on the blackboard. We develop the first implementation of
this proposal and conduct experiments on commonsense knowledge, reasoning and
mathematical datasets. The results show that our system can be competitive with
the SOTA static and dynamic MASs by achieving the best average performance, and
at the same time manage to spend less tokens. Our proposal has the potential to
enable complex and dynamic problem-solving where well-defined structures or
workflows are unavailable.

Conclusion: 结论是提出的分散部署控制器能够有效应对轨道动力学不稳定性，适用于小型卫星群的长期稳定编队。

Abstract: This paper presents an autonomous guidance and control strategy for a
satellite swarm that enables scalable distributed space structures for
innovative science and business opportunities. The averaged $J_2$ orbital
parameters that describe the drift and periodic orbital motion were derived
along with their target values to achieve a distributed space structure in a
decentralized manner. This enabled the design of a distance-based orbital
stabilizer to ensure autonomous deployment into a monolithic formation of a
coplanar equidistant configuration on a user-defined orbital plane. Continuous
formation control was assumed to be achieved through fuel-free actuation, such
as satellite magnetic field interaction and differential aerodynamic forces,
thereby maintaining long-term formation stability without thruster usage. A
major challenge for such actuation systems is the potential loss of control
capability due to increasing inter-satellite distances resulting from unstable
orbital dynamics, particularly for autonomous satellite swarms. To mitigate
this risk, our decentralized deployment controller minimized drift distance
during unexpected communication outages. As a case study, we consider the
deployment of palm-sized satellites into a coplanar equidistant formation in a
$J_2$-perturbed orbit. Moreover, centralized grouping strategies are presented.

Method: 提出了映射幂等性约束、变换可逆性约束和潜在变量一致性约束，以增强多代压缩的鲁棒性。

Result: 在Owlii和8iVFB数据集上的实验表明，所提方法能有效抑制多代损失，同时保持与基线模型相当的单次率失真性能。

Conclusion: 本文方法为解决多代压缩中的质量下降问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing learned point cloud attribute compression methods primarily focus on
single-pass rate-distortion optimization, while overlooking the issue of
cumulative distortion in multi-generation compression scenarios. This paper,
for the first time, investigates the multi-generation issue in learned point
cloud attribute compression. We identify two primary factors contributing to
quality degradation in multi-generation compression: quantization-induced
non-idempotency and transformation irreversibility. To address the former, we
propose a Mapping Idempotency Constraint, that enables the network to learn the
complete compression-decompression mapping, enhancing its robustness to
repeated processes. To address the latter, we introduce a Transformation
Reversibility Constraint, which preserves reversible information flow via a
quantization-free training path. Further, we propose a Latent Variable
Consistency Constraint which enhances the multi-generation compression
robustness by incorporating a decompression-compression cross-generation path
and a latent variable consistency loss term. Extensive experiments conducted on
the Owlii and 8iVFB datasets verify that the proposed methods can effectively
suppress multi-generation loss while maintaining single-pass rate-distortion
performance comparable to baseline models.

Conclusion: 该系统有效解决了障碍物导航问题，展示了在复杂地形中的适应性，具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Current control strategies for powered lower limb prostheses often lack
awareness of the environment and the user's intended interactions with it. This
limitation becomes particularly apparent in complex terrains. Obstacle
negotiation, a critical scenario exemplifying such challenges, requires both
real-time perception of obstacle geometry and responsiveness to user intention
about when and where to step over or onto, to dynamically adjust swing
trajectories. We propose a novel control strategy that fuses environmental
awareness and human cooperativeness: an on-board depth camera detects obstacles
ahead of swing phase, prompting an elevated early-swing trajectory to ensure
clearance, while late-swing control defers to natural biomechanical cues from
the user. This approach enables intuitive stepping strategies without requiring
unnatural movement patterns. Experiments with three non-amputee participants
demonstrated 100 percent success across more than 150 step-overs and 30
step-ons with randomly placed obstacles of varying heights (4-16 cm) and
distances (15-70 cm). By effectively addressing obstacle navigation -- a
gateway challenge for complex terrain mobility -- our system demonstrates
adaptability to both environmental constraints and user intentions, with
promising applications across diverse locomotion scenarios.

Conclusion: VISTA平台无关，适用于多种机器人，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: We present VISTA (Viewpoint-based Image selection with Semantic Task
Awareness), an active exploration method for robots to plan informative
trajectories that improve 3D map quality in areas most relevant for task
completion. Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., "find a
person"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the
object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its
environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic
similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment.
To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient
viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view
diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage
metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in
computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware
experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps,
compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less
challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying
it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory
perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery
noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate
robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While
existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address
general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or
the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by
offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep
learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time
Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and
subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks
(NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural
networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and
training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored.
Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to
facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific
contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general,
regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific
implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies
in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable
roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for
next-generation robots.

Conclusion: SonoGym为机器人手术学习研究提供了有力工具，促进了相关技术的发展。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is a widely used medical imaging modality due to its
real-time capabilities, non-invasive nature, and cost-effectiveness. Robotic
ultrasound can further enhance its utility by reducing operator dependence and
improving access to complex anatomical regions. For this, while deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) and imitation learning (IL) have shown potential
for autonomous navigation, their use in complex surgical tasks such as anatomy
reconstruction and surgical guidance remains limited -- largely due to the lack
of realistic and efficient simulation environments tailored to these tasks. We
introduce SonoGym, a scalable simulation platform for complex robotic
ultrasound tasks that enables parallel simulation across tens to hundreds of
environments. Our framework supports realistic and real-time simulation of US
data from CT-derived 3D models of the anatomy through both a physics-based and
a generative modeling approach. Sonogym enables the training of DRL and recent
IL agents (vision transformers and diffusion policies) for relevant tasks in
robotic orthopedic surgery by integrating common robotic platforms and
orthopedic end effectors. We further incorporate submodular DRL -- a recent
method that handles history-dependent rewards -- for anatomy reconstruction and
safe reinforcement learning for surgery. Our results demonstrate successful
policy learning across a range of scenarios, while also highlighting the
limitations of current methods in clinically relevant environments. We believe
our simulation can facilitate research in robot learning approaches for such
challenging robotic surgery applications. Dataset, codes, and videos are
publicly available at https://sonogym.github.io/.

Result: 实验结果表明方法有效，并通过Python仿真包UAIBot公开提供。

Conclusion: 新方法解决了现有问题，具有实用性和有效性。

Abstract: In many robotics applications, it is necessary to compute not only the
distance between the robot and the environment, but also its derivative - for
example, when using control barrier functions. However, since the traditional
Euclidean distance is not differentiable, there is a need for alternative
distance metrics that possess this property. Recently, a metric with guaranteed
differentiability was proposed [1]. This approach has some important drawbacks,
which we address in this paper. We provide much simpler and practical
expressions for the smooth projection for general convex polytopes.
Additionally, as opposed to [1], we ensure that the distance vanishes as the
objects overlap. We show the efficacy of the approach in experimental results.
Our proposed distance metric is publicly available through the Python-based
simulation package UAIBot.

Result: 在复杂场景中，尤其是高自由度机械臂，bur基方法优于固定基元方法，同时在简单场景中表现相当。

Conclusion: 自适应运动基元显著提高了运动规划效率，特别是在复杂和高自由度场景中。

Abstract: This work proposes a motion planning algorithm for robotic manipulators that
combines sampling-based and search-based planning methods. The core
contribution of the proposed approach is the usage of burs of free
configuration space (C-space) as adaptive motion primitives within the graph
search algorithm. Due to their feature to adaptively expand in free C-space,
burs enable more efficient exploration of the configuration space compared to
fixed-sized motion primitives, significantly reducing the time to find a valid
path and the number of required expansions. The algorithm is implemented within
the existing SMPL (Search-Based Motion Planning Library) library and evaluated
through a series of different scenarios involving manipulators with varying
number of degrees-of-freedom (DoF) and environment complexity. Results
demonstrate that the bur-based approach outperforms fixed-primitive planning in
complex scenarios, particularly for high DoF manipulators, while achieving
comparable performance in simpler scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have the
potential to transform biological research by enabling autonomous

design, limited adaptability to dynamic lab conditions, inadequate error
handling, and high operational complexity. Here we introduce BioMARS
(Biological Multi-Agent Robotic System), an intelligent platform that
integrates LLMs, VLMs, and modular robotics to autonomously design, plan, and
execute biological experiments. BioMARS uses a hierarchical architecture: the
Biologist Agent synthesizes protocols via retrieval-augmented generation; the
Technician Agent translates them into executable robotic pseudo-code; and the
Inspector Agent ensures procedural integrity through multimodal perception and
anomaly detection. The system autonomously conducts cell passaging and culture
tasks, matching or exceeding manual performance in viability, consistency, and
morphological integrity. It also supports context-aware optimization,
outperforming conventional strategies in differentiating retinal pigment
epithelial cells. A web interface enables real-time human-AI collaboration,
while a modular backend allows scalable integration with laboratory hardware.
These results highlight the feasibility of generalizable, AI-driven laboratory

Abstract: As modern computing advances, new interaction paradigms have emerged,
particularly in Augmented Reality (AR), which overlays virtual interfaces onto
physical objects. This evolution poses challenges in machine perception,
especially for tasks like 3D object pose estimation in complex, dynamic

enable accurate 3D localization in dynamic settings. To enhance precision, we
leverage digital twin localization technologies, using datasets like
DTTD-Mobile and specialized hardware such as the ZED2 camera for real-world

Result: 成功实现四足机器人在60厘米宽间隙、不规则楼梯和15-35厘米间距踏石上的稳健跳跃。

Conclusion: JumpER为极端欠驱动和极端地形下的运动任务提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential in enabling quadruped
robots to perform agile locomotion. However, directly training policies to
simultaneously handle dual extreme challenges, i.e., extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains, as in monopedal hopping tasks, remains highly challenging due
to unstable early-stage interactions and unreliable reward feedback. To address
this, we propose JumpER (jump-start reinforcement learning via self-evolving
priors), an RL training framework that structures policy learning into multiple
stages of increasing complexity. By dynamically generating self-evolving priors
through iterative bootstrapping of previously learned policies, JumpER
progressively refines and enhances guidance, thereby stabilizing exploration
and policy optimization without relying on external expert priors or
handcrafted reward shaping. Specifically, when integrated with a structured
three-stage curriculum that incrementally evolves action modality, observation
space, and task objective, JumpER enables quadruped robots to achieve robust
monopedal hopping on unpredictable terrains for the first time. Remarkably, the
resulting policy effectively handles challenging scenarios that traditional
methods struggle to conquer, including wide gaps up to 60 cm, irregularly
spaced stairs, and stepping stones with distances varying from 15 cm to 35 cm.
JumpER thus provides a principled and scalable approach for addressing
locomotion tasks under the dual challenges of extreme underactuation and
extreme terrains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计多样且安全关键的驾驶场景对评估自动驾驶系统至关重要，但手动生成耗时且难以覆盖边缘情况。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶的仿真测试提供了高效且可控的工具，尤其适用于生成复杂或罕见场景。

Abstract: Designing diverse and safety-critical driving scenarios is essential for
evaluating autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for few-shot code
generation to automatically synthesize driving scenarios within the CARLA
simulator, which has flexibility in scenario scripting, efficient code-based
control of traffic participants, and enforcement of realistic physical
dynamics. Given a few example prompts and code samples, the LLM generates
safety-critical scenario scripts that specify the behavior and placement of
traffic participants, with a particular focus on collision events. To bridge
the gap between simulation and real-world appearance, we integrate a video
generation pipeline using Cosmos-Transfer1 with ControlNet, which converts
rendered scenes into realistic driving videos. Our approach enables
controllable scenario generation and facilitates the creation of rare but
critical edge cases, such as pedestrian crossings under occlusion or sudden
vehicle cut-ins. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method in generating a wide range of realistic, diverse, and safety-critical
scenarios, offering a promising tool for simulation-based testing of autonomous
vehicles.

Abstract: Recent advancements in open-source Visual Language Models (VLMs) such as
LLaVA, Qwen-VL, and Llama have catalyzed extensive research on their
integration with diverse systems. The internet-scale general knowledge
encapsulated within these models presents significant opportunities for
enhancing autonomous driving perception, prediction, and planning capabilities.
In this paper we propose VLAD, a vision-language autonomous driving model,
which integrates a fine-tuned VLM with VAD, a state-of-the-art end-to-end
system. We implement a specialized fine-tuning approach using custom
question-answer datasets designed specifically to improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities of the model. The enhanced VLM generates high-level navigational
commands that VAD subsequently processes to guide vehicle operation.
Additionally, our system produces interpretable natural language explanations
of driving decisions, thereby increasing transparency and trustworthiness of
the traditionally black-box end-to-end architecture. Comprehensive evaluation
on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our integrated system
reduces average collision rates by 31.82% compared to baseline methodologies,
establishing a new benchmark for VLM-augmented autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该方法克服了车道中心线模型的局限性，提供了更高效和全面的驾驶环境表示。

Abstract: Accurate motion forecasting is critical for safe and efficient autonomous
driving, enabling vehicles to predict future trajectories and make informed
decisions in complex traffic scenarios. Most of the current designs of motion
prediction models are based on the major representation of lane centerlines,
which limits their capability to capture critical road environments and traffic
rules and constraints. In this work, we propose an enhanced motion forecasting
model informed by multiple vector map elements, including lane boundaries and
road edges, that facilitates a richer and more complete representation of
driving environments. An effective feature fusion strategy is developed to
merge information in different vector map components, where the model learns
holistic information on road structures and their interactions with agents.
Since encoding more information about the road environment increases memory
usage and is computationally expensive, we developed an effective pruning
mechanism that filters the most relevant map connections to the target agent,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining essential spatial and
semantic relationships for accurate trajectory prediction. Overcoming the
limitations of lane centerline-based models, our method provides a more
informative and efficient representation of the driving environment and
advances the state of the art for autonomous vehicle motion forecasting. We
verify our approach with extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 motion
forecasting dataset, where our method maintains competitiveness on AV2 while
achieving improved performance.

Result: TriVLA以约36 Hz运行，在仿真和真实任务中超越现有模仿学习方法。

Conclusion: TriVLA通过动态感知和实时动作生成，显著提升了机器人控制的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) for common-sense
reasoning have led to the development of vision-language-action (VLA) models,
enabling robots to perform generalized manipulation. Although existing
autoregressive VLA methods design a specific architecture like dual-system to
leverage large-scale pretrained knowledge, they tend to capture static
information, often neglecting the dynamic aspects vital for embodied tasks. To
this end, we propose TriVLA, a unified Vision-Language-Action model with a
triple-system architecture for general robot control. The vision-language
module (System 2) interprets the environment through vision and language
instructions. The dynamics perception module (System 3) inherently produces
visual representations that encompass both current static information and
predicted future dynamics, thereby providing valuable guidance for policy
learning. TriVLA utilizes pre-trained VLM model and fine-tunes pre-trained
video foundation model on robot datasets along with internet human manipulation
data. The subsequent policy learning module (System 1) generates fluid motor
actions in real time. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that TriVLA operates
at approximately 36 Hz and surpasses state-of-the-art imitation learning
baselines on standard simulation benchmarks as well as challenging real-world
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel funnel-based tracking control algorithm for
robotic systems with unknown dynamics and prescribed input constraints. The
Euler-Lagrange formulation, a common modeling approach for robotic systems, has
been adopted in this study to address the trade-off between performance and
actuator safety. We establish feasibility conditions that ensure tracking
errors evolve within predefined funnel bounds while maintaining bounded control
efforts, a crucial consideration for robots with limited actuation
capabilities. We propose two approximation-free control strategies for
scenarios where these conditions are violated: one actively corrects the error,
and the other stops further deviation. Finally, we demonstrate the robust
performance and safety of the approach through simulations and experimental
validations. This work represents a significant advancement in funnel-based
control, enhancing its applicability to real-world robotics systems with input
constraints.

Abstract: With the rapid development of more complex robots, Fault Detection and

propose a concept that actively generates a dynamic system model at runtime and
utilizes it to locate root causes. The goal is to be applicable to all kinds of
robotic systems that share a similar software design. Additionally, it should
exhibit minimal overhead and enhance independence from expert attention.

Abstract: Shape-morphing robots have shown benefits in industrial grasping. We propose
form-flexible grippers for adaptive grasping. The design is based on the hybrid
jamming and suction mechanism, which deforms to handle objects that vary
significantly in size from the aperture, including both larger and smaller
parts. Compared with traditional grippers, the gripper achieves self-closing to

through the passive morphing mechanism at the interface that harmonizes
pressure and flow rate. This hybrid gripper showcases the capability to
securely grasp an egg, as small as 54.5% of its aperture, while achieving a
maximum load-to-mass ratio of 94.3.

Motivation: 解决高维空间中机器人路径规划问题，尤其是在复杂环境下（如高度变化剧烈、地面阻力不均等）的路径优化。

Method: 构造由高维欧几里得度量诱导的二维投影平面上的新黎曼度量，并基于此提出增量算法RRT*-R。

Result: 实验表明，RRT*-R算法在多维不均匀场景中表现优异，能有效避开环境突变区域，路径平滑性和优化性优于原始RRT*算法。

Conclusion: RRT*-R算法在二维投影平面上能较好地逼近理论最小测地距离，适用于复杂环境下的机器人路径规划。

Abstract: This paper presents a Riemannian metric-based model to solve the optimal path
planning problem on two-dimensional smooth submanifolds in high-dimensional
space. Our model is based on constructing a new Riemannian metric on a
two-dimensional projection plane, which is induced by the high-dimensional
Euclidean metric on two-dimensional smooth submanifold and reflects the
environmental information of the robot. The optimal path planning problem in
high-dimensional space is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the
two-dimensional plane with new Riemannian metric. Based on the new Riemannian
metric, we proposed an incremental algorithm RRT*-R on the projection plane.
The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is suitable for
scenarios with uneven fields in multiple dimensions. The proposed algorithm can
help the robot to effectively avoid areas with drastic changes in height,
ground resistance and other environmental factors. More importantly, the RRT*-R
algorithm shows better smoothness and optimization properties compared with the
original RRT* algorithm using Euclidean distance in high-dimensional workspace.
The length of the entire path by RRT*-R is a good approximation of the
theoretical minimum geodesic distance on projection plane.

Result: 在真实林业起重机LiDAR数据和模拟环境中验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新算法显著提升了计算效率，适用于复杂户外环境中的细长机械臂。

Abstract: Collision-free motion planning in complex outdoor environments relies heavily
on perceiving the surroundings through exteroceptive sensors. A widely used
approach represents the environment as a voxelized Euclidean distance field,
where robots are typically approximated by spheres. However, for large-scale
manipulators such as forestry cranes, which feature long and slender links,
this conventional spherical approximation becomes inefficient and inaccurate.
This work presents a novel collision detection algorithm specifically designed
to exploit the elongated structure of such manipulators, significantly
enhancing the computational efficiency of motion planning algorithms. Unlike
traditional sphere decomposition methods, our approach not only improves
computational efficiency but also naturally eliminates the need to fine-tune
the approximation accuracy as an additional parameter. We validate the
algorithm's effectiveness using real-world LiDAR data from a forestry crane
application, as well as simulated environment data.

Conclusion: SDP是一种端到端SE(3)等变的扩散策略，显著提升了3D场景变换下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies are effective at learning closed-loop manipulation
policies from human demonstrations but generalize poorly to novel arrangements
of objects in 3D space, hurting real-world performance. To address this issue,
we propose Spherical Diffusion Policy (SDP), an SE(3) equivariant diffusion
policy that adapts trajectories according to 3D transformations of the scene.
Such equivariance is achieved by embedding the states, actions, and the
denoising process in spherical Fourier space. Additionally, we employ novel
spherical FiLM layers to condition the action denoising process equivariantly
on the scene embeddings. Lastly, we propose a spherical denoising temporal
U-net that achieves spatiotemporal equivariance with computational efficiency.
In the end, SDP is end-to-end SE(3) equivariant, allowing robust generalization
across transformed 3D scenes. SDP demonstrates a large performance improvement
over strong baselines in 20 simulation tasks and 5 physical robot tasks
including single-arm and bi-manual embodiments. Code is available at

Abstract: To address the screw loosening and pullout limitations of rigid pedicle
screws in spinal fixation procedures, and to leverage our recently developed
Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) and Flexible Pedicle Screw
(FPS), in this paper, we introduce the concept of Augmented Bridge Spinal
Fixation (AB-SF). In this concept, two connecting J-shape tunnels are first
drilled through pedicles of vertebra using the CT-SDR. Next, two FPSs are
passed through this tunnel and bone cement is then injected through the
cannulated region of the FPS to form an augmented bridge between two pedicles
and reinforce strength of the fixated spine. To experimentally analyze and
study the feasibility of AB-SF technique, we first used our robotic system
(i.e., a CT-SDR integrated with a robotic arm) to create two different fixation
scenarios in which two J-shape tunnels, forming a bridge, were drilled at
different depth of a vertebral phantom. Next, we implanted two FPSs within the
drilled tunnels and then successfully simulated the bone cement augmentation
process.

Result: 通过模拟骨骼模型的S形钻孔实验验证了该机器人的性能。

Conclusion: pelvic CT-SDR能够适应骨盆复杂解剖结构，提供更优的手术路径，减少并发症。

Abstract: Current pelvic fixation techniques rely on rigid drilling tools, which
inherently constrain the placement of rigid medical screws in the complex
anatomy of pelvis. These constraints prevent medical screws from following
anatomically optimal pathways and force clinicians to fixate screws in linear
trajectories. This suboptimal approach, combined with the unnatural placement
of the excessively long screws, lead to complications such as screw
misplacement, extended surgery times, and increased radiation exposure due to
repeated X-ray images taken ensure to safety of procedure. To address these
challenges, in this paper, we present the design and development of a unique 4
degree-of-freedom (DoF) pelvic concentric tube steerable drilling robot (pelvic
CT-SDR). The pelvic CT-SDR is capable of creating long S-shaped drilling
trajectories that follow the natural curvatures of the pelvic anatomy. The
performance of the pelvic CT-SDR was thoroughly evaluated through several
S-shape drilling experiments in simulated bone phantoms.

Result: 在GR1 Humanoid和LIBERO基准测试中表现优于通用模型，并与其他MoE管道竞争。

Conclusion: MoIRA展示了模块化部署的实用性，为未来多专家机器人系统提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches have recently gained traction in robotics
applications due to their ability to dynamically allocate computational
resources and specialize sub-networks for distinct tasks or environmental
contexts, enabling more efficient decision-making. Such systems often comprise
sparsely activated experts combined under a single monolithic architecture and
require a well-configured internal routing mechanism, which does not allow for
selective low-level expert and router customization and requires additional
training. We propose MoIRA, an architecture-agnostic modular MoE framework
designed to coordinate existing experts with an external text-based router.
MoIRA incorporates two zero-shot routing options: embedding-based similarity
and prompt-driven language model inference. In our experiments, we choose large
Vision-Language-Action models, gr00t-N1 and $\pi_0$, as the underlying experts,
and train low-rank adapters for low-overhead inference. We evaluate MoIRA on
various GR1 Humanoid tasks and LIBERO Spatial and Goal benchmarks, where it
consistently outperforms generalist models and competes with other MoE
pipelines. Additionally, we analyse the robustness of the proposed approach to
the variations of the instructions. While relying solely on textual
descriptions of tasks and experts, MoIRA demonstrates the practical viability
of modular deployment with precise, low-effort routing and provides an
alternative, scalable foundation for future multi-expert robotic systems.

Abstract: Dexterous teleoperation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation for
real-world data collection and remote robot control. Previous dexterous
teleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand
postures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent
dexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their
structural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we
propose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables
dexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion
patterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the
teleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to
complete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible
dexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures
used in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM
(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to
identify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and
operator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and
imitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types
significantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform
diverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.

Abstract: The remarkable advancements of vision and language foundation models in
multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation has sparked growing efforts
to extend such intelligence to the physical world, fueling the flourishing of
vision-language-action (VLA) models. Despite seemingly diverse approaches, we
observe that current VLA models can be unified under a single framework: vision
and language inputs are processed by a series of VLA modules, producing a chain
of \textit{action tokens} that progressively encode more grounded and
actionable information, ultimately generating executable actions. We further
determine that the primary design choice distinguishing VLA models lies in how
action tokens are formulated, which can be categorized into language
description, code, affordance, trajectory, goal state, latent representation,
raw action, and reasoning. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive
understanding regarding action tokens, significantly impeding effective VLA
development and obscuring future directions. Therefore, this survey aims to
categorize and interpret existing VLA research through the lens of action
tokenization, distill the strengths and limitations of each token type, and
identify areas for improvement. Through this systematic review and analysis, we
offer a synthesized outlook on the broader evolution of VLA models, highlight
underexplored yet promising directions, and contribute guidance for future
research, hoping to bring the field closer to general-purpose intelligence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized robotic autonomy, including
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Recent studies have demonstrated the potential
of LLMs for translating human instructions into executable control code for UAV
operations. However, LLMs still face challenges from logical reasoning and
complex decision-making, leading to concerns about the reliability of
LLM-driven UAV operations. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop
control framework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective
feedback and refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an
Evaluator. Our framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV
operations into natural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the
evaluator LLM's understanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation.
Our framework also enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence
eliminates the risks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during
the refinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different
complexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework
can achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms
baseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase
of task complexity.

Abstract: Recently, mobile manipulation has attracted increasing attention for enabling
language-conditioned robotic control in household tasks. However, existing
methods still face challenges in coordinating mobile base and manipulator,
primarily due to two limitations. On the one hand, they fail to explicitly
model the influence of the mobile base on manipulator control, which easily
leads to error accumulation under high degrees of freedom. On the other hand,
they treat the entire mobile manipulation process with the same visual
observation modality (e.g., either all 2D or all 3D), overlooking the distinct
multimodal perception requirements at different stages during mobile
manipulation. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Coordination Diffusion
Transformer (AC-DiT), which enhances mobile base and manipulator coordination
for end-to-end mobile manipulation. First, since the motion of the mobile base
directly influences the manipulator's actions, we introduce a mobility-to-body
conditioning mechanism that guides the model to first extract base motion
representations, which are then used as context prior for predicting whole-body
actions. This enables whole-body control that accounts for the potential impact
of the mobile base's motion. Second, to meet the perception requirements at
different stages of mobile manipulation, we design a perception-aware
multimodal conditioning strategy that dynamically adjusts the fusion weights
between various 2D visual images and 3D point clouds, yielding visual features
tailored to the current perceptual needs. This allows the model to, for
example, adaptively rely more on 2D inputs when semantic information is crucial
for action prediction, while placing greater emphasis on 3D geometric
information when precise spatial understanding is required. We validate AC-DiT
through extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world mobile
manipulation tasks.

*Jing Luo,Xinyu Yang,Jie Wei*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为XMVAE的模型，结合了作曲家和钢琴家的双重角色，通过ECP表示和双分支结构生成高质量古典钢琴表演。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古典音乐的创作不仅依赖于作曲家编写的乐谱，还依赖于表演者对静态乐谱的诠释。论文旨在模拟作曲家和钢琴家在创作过程中的双重角色，生成具有表现力的古典钢琴表演。

Method: 论文提出了ECP表示法，用于捕捉古典表演的韵律结构和表现细节。XMVAE模型包含两个分支：VQ-VAE分支生成乐谱相关内容（作曲家角色），普通VAE分支生成表现细节（钢琴家角色）。两个分支通过多尺度编码器和正交Transformer解码器联合训练。

Result: XMVAE生成的古典表演在客观和主观评估中均优于现有模型。此外，作曲家分支在额外乐谱数据集上的预训练显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: XMVAE通过结合作曲家和钢琴家的角色，成功生成了高质量的古典钢琴表演，为音乐生成领域提供了新的方法。

Abstract: The creativity of classical music arises not only from composers who craft
the musical sheets but also from performers who interpret the static notations
with expressive nuances. This paper addresses the challenge of generating
classical piano performances from scratch, aiming to emulate the dual roles of
composer and pianist in the creative process. We introduce the Expressive
Compound Word (ECP) representation, which effectively captures both the
metrical structure and expressive nuances of classical performances. Building
on this, we propose the Expressive Music Variational AutoEncoder (XMVAE), a
model featuring two branches: a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQ-VAE) branch that generates score-related content, representing the
Composer, and a vanilla VAE branch that produces expressive details, fulfilling
the role of Pianist. These branches are jointly trained with similar Seq2Seq
architectures, leveraging a multiscale encoder to capture beat-level contextual
information and an orthogonal Transformer decoder for efficient compound tokens
decoding. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that XMVAE
generates classical performances with superior musical quality compared to
state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, pretraining the Composer branch on extra
musical score datasets contribute to a significant performance gain.

Motivation: 现有方法局限于四音轨分离，缺乏灵活性，无法满足实际应用需求。

Method: 提出GuideSep，结合波形模仿条件和mel谱图掩码，利用扩散模型实现乐器无关分离。

Result: GuideSep在客观和主观评估中均表现优异，支持更灵活的乐器提取。

Conclusion: GuideSep展示了用户参与扩散生成过程的潜力，为音乐源分离提供了新思路。

Abstract: Music source separation (MSS) aims to extract individual instrument sources
from their mixture. While most existing methods focus on the widely adopted
four-stem separation setup (vocals, bass, drums, and other instruments), this
approach lacks the flexibility needed for real-world applications. To address
this, we propose GuideSep, a diffusion-based MSS model capable of
instrument-agnostic separation beyond the four-stem setup. GuideSep is
conditioned on multiple inputs: a waveform mimicry condition, which can be
easily provided by humming or playing the target melody, and mel-spectrogram
domain masks, which offer additional guidance for separation. Unlike prior
approaches that relied on fixed class labels or sound queries, our conditioning
scheme, coupled with the generative approach, provides greater flexibility and
applicability. Additionally, we design a mask-prediction baseline using the
same model architecture to systematically compare predictive and generative
approaches. Our objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that GuideSep
achieves high-quality separation while enabling more versatile instrument
extraction, highlighting the potential of user participation in the
diffusion-based generative process for MSS. Our code and demo page are

Conclusion: 展示了在低成本边缘设备上部署分布式声学监测网络的可行性，支持智能城市基础设施中的协作紧急车辆跟踪。

Abstract: We present a full-stack emergency vehicle (EV) siren detection system
designed for real-time deployment on embedded hardware. The proposed approach
is based on E2PANNs, a fine-tuned convolutional neural network derived from
EPANNs, and optimized for binary sound event detection under urban acoustic
conditions. A key contribution is the creation of curated and semantically
structured datasets - AudioSet-EV, AudioSet-EV Augmented, and Unified-EV -
developed using a custom AudioSet-Tools framework to overcome the low
reliability of standard AudioSet annotations. The system is deployed on a
Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a high-fidelity DAC+microphone board, implementing
a multithreaded inference engine with adaptive frame sizing, probability
smoothing, and a decision-state machine to control false positive activations.
A remote WebSocket interface provides real-time monitoring and facilitates live
demonstration capabilities. Performance is evaluated using both framewise and
event-based metrics across multiple configurations. Results show the system
achieves low-latency detection with improved robustness under realistic audio
conditions. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deploying IoS-compatible
SED solutions that can form distributed acoustic monitoring networks, enabling
collaborative emergency vehicle tracking across smart city infrastructures
through WebSocket connectivity on low-cost edge devices.

Abstract: This work addresses the development of a database for the automatic

accuracy of naturalness prediction models. The dataset consists of 4,326 audio
samples from 52 different TTS systems and human voices and is, up to our
knowledge, the first of its kind in Spanish. To label the audios, a subjective
test was designed based on the ITU-T Rec. P.807 standard and completed by 92
participants. Furthermore, the utility of the collected dataset was validated
by training automatic naturalness prediction systems. We explored two
approaches: fine-tuning an existing model originally trained for English, and
training small downstream networks on top of frozen self-supervised speech
models. Our models achieve a mean absolute error of 0.8 on a five-point MOS
scale. Further analysis demonstrates the quality and diversity of the developed
dataset, and its potential to advance TTS research in Spanish.

Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging,
yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity
remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables
voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical
regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this
study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age
from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D
CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key
hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus,
posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal
lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age.
Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals
distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These
findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal
aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover
biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

Result: 通过办公和住宅设计的案例研究，展示了该框架如何平衡效率和情感影响。

Conclusion: 结合机器学习与人类创造力，可以实现功能性与情感共鸣并存的空间设计。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into spatial design holds immense
potential for optimizing space utilization, enhancing functionality, and
streamlining design processes. ML can automate tasks, predict performance
outcomes, and tailor spaces to user preferences. However, the emotional,
cultural, and aesthetic dimensions of design remain crucial for creating spaces
that truly resonate with users-elements that ML alone cannot address. The key
challenge lies in harmonizing data-driven efficiency with the nuanced,
subjective aspects of design. This paper proposes a human-machine collaboration
framework to bridge this gap. An effective framework should recognize that
while ML enhances design efficiency through automation and prediction, it must
be paired with human creativity to ensure spaces are emotionally engaging and
culturally relevant. Human designers contribute intuition, empathy, and
cultural insight, guiding ML-generated solutions to align with users' emotional
and cultural needs. Additionally, we explore how various ML models can be
integrated with human-centered design principles. These models can automate
design generation and optimization, while human designers refine the outputs to
ensure emotional resonance and aesthetic appeal. Through case studies in office
and residential design, we illustrate how this framework fosters both
creativity and cultural relevance. By merging ML with human creativity, spatial
design can achieve a balance of efficiency and emotional impact, resulting in
environments that are both functional and deeply human.

Abstract: Trauma prevalence is vast globally. Evidence-based digital treatments can
help, but most require human guidance. Human guides provide tailored
instructions and responsiveness to internal cognitive states, but limit
scalability. Can generative AI and neurotechnology provide a scalable
alternative? Here we test ANTIDOTE, combining AI guidance and pupillometry to
automatically deliver and monitor an evidence-based digital treatment,
specifically the Imagery Competing Task Intervention (ICTI), to reduce
intrusive memories after psychological trauma. One hundred healthy volunteers
were exposed to videos of traumatic events and randomly assigned to an
intervention or active control condition. As predicted, intervention
participants reported significantly fewer intrusive memories over the following
week. Post-hoc assessment against clinical rubrics confirmed the AI guide
delivered the intervention successfully. Additionally, pupil size tracked
intervention engagement and predicted symptom reduction, providing a candidate
biomarker of intervention effectiveness. These findings open a path toward
rigorous AI-guided digital interventions that can scale to trauma prevalence.

Abstract: Traditional simulator-based training for maritime professionals is critical
for ensuring safety at sea but often depends on subjective trainer assessments
of technical skills, behavioral focus, communication, and body language, posing
challenges such as subjectivity, difficulty in measuring key features, and
cognitive limitations. Addressing these issues, this study develops an
AI-driven framework to enhance maritime training by objectively assessing
trainee performance through visual focus tracking, speech recognition, and
stress detection, improving readiness for high-risk scenarios. The system
integrates AI techniques, including visual focus determination using eye
tracking, pupil dilation analysis, and computer vision; communication analysis
through a maritime-specific speech-to-text model and natural language
processing; communication correctness using large language models; and mental
stress detection via vocal pitch. Models were evaluated on data from simulated
maritime scenarios with seafarers exposed to controlled high-stress events. The
AI algorithms achieved high accuracy, with ~92% for visual detection, ~91% for
maritime speech recognition, and ~90% for stress detection, surpassing existing
benchmarks. The system provides insights into visual attention, adherence to
communication checklists, and stress levels under demanding conditions. This
study demonstrates how AI can transform maritime training by delivering
objective performance analytics, enabling personalized feedback, and improving

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLM）缺乏对全球多样文化背景的理解，尤其是在拉丁美洲等地区，因此需要一种更接地气的方法来构建文化敏感的对话AI。

Method: 通过参与式工作坊收集拉丁美洲的定性数据，分析文化错位、区域对健康聊天机器人的看法及文化适应性策略。

Result: 研究发现学术文化概念在现实中失去意义，需考虑经济、政治、地理等多维因素，提出了'多元宇宙健康对话AI'框架。

Conclusion: 构建文化敏感的对话AI需要更多关系性和包容性，而不仅是数据量的增加。

Abstract: There is justifiable interest in leveraging conversational AI (CAI) for
health across the majority world, but to be effective, CAI must respond
appropriately within culturally and linguistically diverse contexts. Therefore,
we need ways to address the fact that current LLMs exclude many lived
experiences globally. Various advances are underway which focus on top-down
approaches and increasing training data. In this paper, we aim to complement
these with a bottom-up locally-grounded approach based on qualitative data
collected during participatory workshops in Latin America. Our goal is to
construct a rich and human-centred understanding of: a) potential areas of
cultural misalignment in digital health; b) regional perspectives on chatbots
for health and c)strategies for creating culturally-appropriate CAI; with a
focus on the understudied Latin American context. Our findings show that
academic boundaries on notions of culture lose meaning at the ground level and
technologies will need to engage with a broader framework; one that
encapsulates the way economics, politics, geography and local logistics are
entangled in cultural experience. To this end, we introduce a framework for
'Pluriversal Conversational AI for Health' which allows for the possibility
that more relationality and tolerance, rather than just more data, may be
called for.

Conclusion: 通过显式建模GUI隐喻，聊天机器人的交互清晰度和后端逻辑对齐得到改善。

Abstract: Domain specific chatbot applications often involve multi step interactions,
such as refining search filters, selecting multiple items, or performing
comparisons. Traditional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) handle these
workflows by providing explicit "Submit" (commit data) and "Reset" (discard
data) actions, allowing back-end systems to track user intent unambiguously. In
contrast, conversational agents rely on subtle language cues, which can lead to
confusion and incomplete context management. This paper proposes modeling these
GUI inspired metaphors acknowledgment (submit like) and context switching
(reset-like) as explicit tasks within large language model (LLM) prompts. By
capturing user acknowledgment, reset actions, and chain of thought (CoT)
reasoning as structured session data, we preserve clarity, reduce user
confusion, and align domain-specific chatbot interactions with back-end logic.
We demonstrate our approach in hotel booking and customer management scenarios,
highlighting improvements in multi-turn task coherence, user satisfaction, and
efficiency.

focus on scenarios when the interceptors lack radial acceleration capabilities,
relying solely on their lateral acceleration components. This consideration
aligns with their inherent kinematic turn constraints. The proposed strategy
explicitly addresses the complexities of coupled 3D engagements, thereby
mitigating performance degradation that typically arises when the pitch and yaw
channels are decoupled into two separate, mutually orthogonal planar
engagements. Moreover, our formulation incorporates modeling uncertainties
associated with the time-to-go estimation into the derivation of cooperative
guidance commands to ensure robustness against inaccuracies in dynamic
engagement scenarios. To optimize control efficiency, we analytically derive
the lateral acceleration components in the orthogonal pitch and yaw channels by
solving an instantaneous optimization problem, subject to an affine constraint.
We show that the proposed cooperative guidance commands guarantee consensus in
time-to-go values within a predefined time, which can be prescribed as a design
parameter, regardless of the interceptors' initial configurations. We provide
simulations to attest to the efficacy of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SAC强化学习和GAIL模仿学习的卫星姿态控制框架，提升了对未知扰动的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统控制方法依赖精确模型且对扰动敏感，需改进以应对不确定性。

Method: 开发SAC专家控制器提升鲁棒性，再用GAIL模仿专家轨迹降低训练成本。

Result: SAC专家在多种扰动下表现优异，GAIL能有效模仿专家特征。

Conclusion: SAC与GAIL结合降低了样本复杂度，为智能自主航天器控制铺路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel satellite attitude control framework that
integrates Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning with Generative
Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) to achieve robust performance under
various unknown perturbations. Traditional control techniques often rely on
precise system models and are sensitive to parameter uncertainties and external
perturbations. To overcome these limitations, we first develop a SAC-based
expert controller that demonstrates improved resilience against actuator
failures, sensor noise, and attitude misalignments, outperforming our previous
results in several challenging scenarios. We then use GAIL to train a learner
policy that imitates the expert's trajectories, thereby reducing training costs
and improving generalization through expert demonstrations. Preliminary
experiments under single and combined perturbations show that the SAC expert
can rotate the antenna to a specified direction and keep the antenna
orientation reliably stable in most of the listed perturbations. Additionally,
the GAIL learner can imitate most of the features from the trajectories
generated by the SAC expert. Comparative evaluations and ablation studies
confirm the effectiveness of the SAC algorithm and reward shaping. The
integration of GAIL further reduces sample complexity and demonstrates
promising imitation capabilities, paving the way for more intelligent and
autonomous spacecraft control systems.

Abstract: Time-varying coverage control addresses the challenge of coordinating
multiple agents covering an environment where regions of interest change over
time. This problem has broad applications, including the deployment of
autonomous taxis and coordination in search and rescue operations. The
achievement of effective coverage is complicated by the presence of
time-varying density functions, nonlinear agent dynamics, and stringent system
and safety constraints. In this paper, we present a distributed multi-agent
control framework for time-varying coverage under nonlinear constrained
dynamics. Our approach integrates a reference trajectory planner and a tracking
model predictive control (MPC) scheme, which operate at different frequencies
within a multi-rate framework. For periodic density functions, we demonstrate
closed-loop convergence to an optimal configuration of trajectories and provide
formal guarantees regarding constraint satisfaction, collision avoidance, and
recursive feasibility. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm capable
of handling nonperiodic density functions, making the approach suitable for
practical applications. Finally, we validate our method through hardware
experiments using a fleet of four miniature race cars.

Abstract: Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems
remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and
electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of
next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is
proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic
properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic
moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike
previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds,
the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable,
binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the
Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and
advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix
sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic
ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes,
addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic
moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's
matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately
estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic
behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient
framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic
materials with tailored properties.

Conclusion: 遗传算法在测试方法中表现最优，但大图中算法表现与理论界限的差距仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: The NP-complete mutual-visibility (MV) problem currently lacks empirical
analysis on its practical behaviour despite theoretical studies. This paper
addresses this gap by implementing and evaluating three distinct algorithms - a
direct greedy heuristic, a hypergraph-based approximation, and a genetic
algorithm - on diverse synthetic graph datasets, including those with
analytically known $\mu(G)$ values and general graph models. Our results
demonstrate that for smaller graphs, the algorithms consistently achieve MV set
sizes aligning with theoretical bounds. However, for larger instances, achieved
solution sizes notably diverge from theoretical limits; this, combined with the
absence of tight bounds, complicates absolute quality assessment. Nevertheless,
validation on known optimal graphs showed the Genetic Algorithm and other
heuristics empirically performing best among tested methods.

Abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are ubiquitous in statistical learning,
particularly for unsupervised problems. While full GMMs suffer from the
overparameterization of their covariance matrices in high-dimensional spaces,
spherical GMMs (with isotropic covariance matrices) certainly lack flexibility
to fit certain anisotropic distributions. Connecting these two extremes, we
introduce a new family of parsimonious GMMs with piecewise-constant covariance
eigenvalue profiles. These extend several low-rank models like the celebrated
mixtures of probabilistic principal component analyzers (MPPCA), by enabling
any possible sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. If the latter are
prespecified, then we can naturally derive an expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm to learn the mixture parameters. Otherwise, to address the
notoriously-challenging issue of jointly learning the mixture parameters and
hyperparameters, we propose a componentwise penalized EM algorithm, whose
monotonicity is proven. We show the superior likelihood-parsimony tradeoffs
achieved by our models on a variety of unsupervised experiments: density
fitting, clustering and single-image denoising.

Abstract: Paired comparison data, where users evaluate items in pairs, play a central
role in ranking and preference learning tasks. While ordinal comparison data
intuitively offer richer information than binary comparisons, this paper
challenges that conventional wisdom. We propose a general parametric framework
for modeling ordinal paired comparisons without ties. The model adopts a
generalized additive structure, featuring a link function that quantifies the
preference difference between two items and a pattern function that governs the
distribution over ordinal response levels. This framework encompasses classical
binary comparison models as special cases, by treating binary responses as
binarized versions of ordinal data. Within this framework, we show that
binarizing ordinal data can significantly improve the accuracy of ranking
recovery. Specifically, we prove that under the counting algorithm, the ranking
error associated with binary comparisons exhibits a faster exponential
convergence rate than that of ordinal data. Furthermore, we characterize a
substantial performance gap between binary and ordinal data in terms of a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) determined by the pattern function. We identify the
pattern function that minimizes the SNR and maximizes the benefit of
binarization. Extensive simulations and a real application on the MovieLens
dataset further corroborate our theoretical findings.

Result: 模型在Mount Asama的测试中表现出色（F1分数：火山构造地震0.930，低频地震0.931，噪声0.980），且注意力权重与人类专家关注的波形特征一致。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的模型为火山地震分类提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，并可通过迁移学习应用于其他火山区域，提升灾害评估能力。

Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the
relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However,
traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires
considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep
learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient
classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model
achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency
earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method.
To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed,
revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human
experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled
B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and
attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and
augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and
diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important
role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings
highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic
earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and
interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and
subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding
seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities
for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced
volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: 为生物子系统交互提供了理论基础和数据驱动的方法，支持精确行为操控。

Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple
subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory
networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to
model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between
them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the
subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the
directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between
subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically
linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by
nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven
nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions
via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning
Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning
method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for
arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs
outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems,
including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area
recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we
show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area
over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the
trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the
foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of
interactions among biological subsystems.

Abstract: In the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, we are given a set $X$ of
data points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, a kernel function $k: \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and a query point $\mathbf{q} \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and the objective is to quickly output an estimate of
$\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in X} k(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x})$. In this paper, we consider
$\textsf{KDE}$ in the dynamic setting, and introduce a data structure that
efficiently maintains the estimates for a set of query points as data points
are added to $X$ over time. Based on this, we design a dynamic data structure
that maintains a sparse approximation of the fully connected similarity graph
on $X$, and develop a fast dynamic spectral clustering algorithm. We further
evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a theory of systemic undecidability, reframing
incomputability as a structural property of systems rather than a localized
feature of specific functions or problems. We define a notion of causal
embedding and prove a closure principle: any subsystem that participates
functionally in the computation of an undecidable system inherits its
undecidability. This result positions undecidability as a pervasive constraint
on prediction, modeling, and epistemic access in both natural and artificial
systems. Our framework disarms oracle mimicry and challenges the view that
computational limits can be circumvented through architectural innovation. By
generalizing classical results into a dynamic systems context, this work
augments the logical trajectory of G\"odel, Turing, and Chaitin, offering a new
perspective of the topology of computability and its interrelation to the
boundaries of scientific knowledge.

Abstract: We study the dispersion problem in anonymous port-labeled graphs: $k \leq n$
mobile agents, each with a unique ID and initially located arbitrarily on the
nodes of an $n$-node graph with maximum degree $\Delta$, must autonomously
relocate so that no node hosts more than one agent. Dispersion serves as a
fundamental task in distributed computing of mobile agents, and its complexity
stems from key challenges in local coordination under anonymity and limited
memory.
  The goal is to minimize both the time to achieve dispersion and the memory
required per agent. It is known that any algorithm requires $\Omega(k)$ time in
the worst case, and $\Omega(\log k)$ bits of memory per agent. A recent result
[SPAA'25] gives an optimal $O(k)$-time algorithm in the synchronous setting and
an $O(k \log k)$-time algorithm in the asynchronous setting, both using
$O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits.
  In this paper, we close the complexity gap in the asynchronous setting by
presenting the first dispersion algorithm that runs in optimal $O(k)$ time
using $O(\log(k+\Delta))$ bits of memory per agent. Our solution is based on a
novel technique we develop in this paper that constructs a port-one tree in
anonymous graphs, which may be of independent interest.

Abstract: Organizations around the world schedule jobs (programs) regularly to perform
various tasks dictated by their end users. With the major movement towards
using a cloud computing infrastructure, our organization follows a hybrid
approach with both cloud and on-prem servers. The objective of this work is to
perform capacity planning, i.e., estimate resource requirements, and job
scheduling for on-prem grid computing environments. A key contribution of our
approach is handling uncertainty in both resource usage and duration of the
jobs, a critical aspect in the finance industry where stochastic market
conditions significantly influence job characteristics. For capacity planning
and scheduling, we simultaneously balance two conflicting objectives: (a)
minimize resource usage, and (b) provide high quality-of-service to the end
users by completing jobs by their requested deadlines. We propose approximate
approaches using deterministic estimators and pair sampling-based constraint
programming. Our best approach (pair sampling-based) achieves much lower peak
resource usage compared to manual scheduling without compromising on the

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their
versatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with
parameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these
models to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.
Deploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial
benefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized
responses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge
devices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter
selection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter
swapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,
processing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational
resources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient
system for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA
incorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism
to streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory
management, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate
memory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient
batch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive
evaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly
outperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and
throughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times
boost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of
magnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's
potential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,
offering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种针对深度推荐模型（DLRM）嵌入层性能瓶颈的优化方法，通过定制数据流和核心分配策略，显著提升了嵌入查找速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLRM的嵌入层因其随机内存访问成为性能瓶颈，影响了AI工作负载的效率。

Method: 提出了四种单核嵌入查找策略和一个多核SoC表映射框架。

Result: 在华为Ascend AI加速器上测试，速度提升1.5x至6.5x，极端情况下可达20x以上。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了嵌入查找性能，且对查询分布的依赖性较低。

Abstract: Deep Recommender Models (DLRMs) inference is a fundamental AI workload
accounting for more than 79% of the total AI workload in Meta's data centers.
DLRMs' performance bottleneck is found in the embedding layers, which perform
many random memory accesses to retrieve small embedding vectors from tables of
various sizes. We propose the design of tailored data flows to speedup
embedding look-ups. Namely, we propose four strategies to look up an embedding
table effectively on one core, and a framework to automatically map the tables
asymmetrically to the multiple cores of a SoC. We assess the effectiveness of
our method using the Huawei Ascend AI accelerators, comparing it with the
default Ascend compiler, and we perform high-level comparisons with Nvidia
A100. Results show a speed-up varying from 1.5x up to 6.5x for real workload
distributions, and more than 20x for extremely unbalanced distributions.
Furthermore, the method proves to be much more independent of the query
distribution than the baseline.

Abstract: The Alps Research Infrastructure leverages GH200 technology at scale,
featuring 10,752 GPUs. Accessing Alps provides a significant computational
advantage for researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). While Alps serves a broad range of scientific communities, traditional
HPC services alone are not sufficient to meet the dynamic needs of the ML
community. This paper presents an initial investigation into extending HPC
service capabilities to better support ML workloads. We identify key challenges
and gaps we have observed since the early-access phase (2023) of Alps by the
Swiss AI community and propose several technological enhancements. These
include a user environment designed to facilitate the adoption of HPC for ML
workloads, balancing performance with flexibility; a utility for rapid
performance screening of ML applications during development; observability
capabilities and data products for inspecting ongoing large-scale ML workloads;
a utility to simplify the vetting of allocated nodes for compute readiness; a
service plane infrastructure to deploy various types of workloads, including
support and inference services; and a storage infrastructure tailored to the
specific needs of ML workloads. These enhancements aim to facilitate the
execution of ML workloads on HPC systems, increase system usability and
resilience, and better align with the needs of the ML community. We also
discuss our current approach to security aspects. This paper concludes by
placing these proposals in the broader context of changes in the communities
served by HPC infrastructure like ours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统解码器缺乏灵活性和可扩展性，难以满足6G网络的异构通信场景需求。

Method: 引入CrossMPT（跨注意力消息传递Transformer），通过两个掩码跨注意力块迭代更新输入表示；扩展为FCrossMPT，使其对编码长度、速率和类别不变；提出CrossED，通过并行CrossMPT块提升性能。

Result: CrossMPT在单神经解码器中达到最优性能；FCrossMPT和CrossED展示了广泛的解码能力和强泛化性。

Conclusion: 提出的AI原生解码器具有灵活性、可扩展性和高性能，为6G网络的信道编码提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Channel coding for 6G networks is expected to support a wide range of
requirements arising from heterogeneous communication scenarios. These demands
challenge traditional code-specific decoders, which lack the flexibility and
scalability required for next-generation systems. To tackle this problem, we
propose an AI-native foundation model for unified and code-agnostic decoding
based on the transformer architecture. We first introduce a cross-attention
message-passing transformer (CrossMPT). CrossMPT employs two masked
cross-attention blocks that iteratively update two distinct input
representations-magnitude and syndrome vectors-allowing the model to
effectively learn the decoding problem. Notably, our CrossMPT has achieved
state-of-the-art decoding performance among single neural decoders. Building on
this, we develop foundation CrossMPT (FCrossMPT) by making the architecture
invariant to code length, rate, and class, allowing a single trained model to
decode a broad range of codes without retraining. To further enhance decoding
performance, particularly for short blocklength codes, we propose CrossMPT
ensemble decoder (CrossED), an ensemble decoder composed of multiple parallel
CrossMPT blocks employing different parity-check matrices. This architecture
can also serve as a foundation model, showing strong generalization across
diverse code types. Overall, the proposed AI-native code-agnostic decoder
offers flexibility, scalability, and high performance, presenting a promising
direction to channel coding for 6G networks.

Result: 当前法律框架未能充分应对AI生成内容对个人自主权、身份权和社会责任的新挑战。

Conclusion: 需要发展新的伦理和法律方法来解决AI系统中的同意问题，以确保公平、透明、问责和自主权。

Abstract: The evolution of generative AI systems exposes the challenges of traditional
legal and ethical frameworks built around consent. This chapter examines how
the conventional notion of consent, while fundamental to data protection and
privacy rights, proves insufficient in addressing the implications of
AI-generated content derived from personal data. Through legal and ethical
analysis, we show that while individuals can consent to the initial use of
their data for AI training, they cannot meaningfully consent to the numerous
potential outputs their data might enable or the extent to which the output is
used or distributed. We identify three fundamental challenges: the scope
problem, the temporality problem, and the autonomy trap, which collectively
create what we term a ''consent gap'' in AI systems and their surrounding
ecosystem. We argue that current legal frameworks inadequately address these
emerging challenges, particularly regarding individual autonomy, identity
rights, and social responsibility, especially in cases where AI-generated
content creates new forms of personal representation beyond the scope of the
original consent. By examining how these consent limitations intersect with
broader principles of responsible AI (including fairness, transparency,
accountability, and autonomy) we demonstrate the need to evolve ethical and
legal approaches to consent.

Abstract: The exponential development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)
technologies like ChatGPT has raised increasing curiosity about their use in
higher education, specifically with respect to how students view them, make use
of them, and the implications for learning outcomes. This paper employs a
hybrid methodological approach involving a systematic literature review and
simulation-based modeling to explore student perceptions of GenAI use in the
context of higher education. A total of nineteen empirical articles from 2023
through 2025 were selected from the PRISMA-based search targeting the Scopus
database. Synthesis of emerging patterns from the literature was achieved by
thematic categorization. Six of these had enough quantitative information,
i.e., item-level means and standard deviations, to permit probabilistic
modeling. One dataset, from the resulting subset, was itself selected as a
representative case with which to illustrate inverse-variance weighting by
Monte Carlo simulation, by virtue of its well-designed Likert scale format and
thematic alignment with the use of computing systems by the researcher.
  The simulation provided a composite "Success Score" forecasting the strength
of the relationship between student perceptions and learning achievements.
Findings reveal that attitude factors concerned with usability and real-world
usefulness are significantly better predictors of positive learning achievement
than affective or trust-based factors. Such an interdisciplinary perspective
provides a unique means of linking thematic results with predictive modelling,
resonating with longstanding controversies about the proper use of GenAI tools
within the university.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了AI披露与作者身份之间的复杂关系，凸显了机器与人类评价模式的差异。

Abstract: As AI integrates in various types of human writing, calls for transparency
around AI assistance are growing. However, if transparency operates on uneven
ground and certain identity groups bear a heavier cost for being honest, then
the burden of openness becomes asymmetrical. This study investigates how AI
disclosure statement affects perceptions of writing quality, and whether these
effects vary by the author's race and gender. Through a large-scale controlled
experiment, both human raters (n = 1,970) and LLM raters (n = 2,520) evaluated
a single human-written news article while disclosure statements and author
demographics were systematically varied. This approach reflects how both human
and algorithmic decisions now influence access to opportunities (e.g., hiring,
promotion) and social recognition (e.g., content recommendation algorithms). We
find that both human and LLM raters consistently penalize disclosed AI use.
However, only LLM raters exhibit demographic interaction effects: they favor
articles attributed to women or Black authors when no disclosure is present.
But these advantages disappear when AI assistance is revealed. These findings
illuminate the complex relationships between AI disclosure and author identity,
highlighting disparities between machine and human evaluation patterns.

Abstract: Critical infrastructure, such as transport networks, underpins economic
growth by enabling mobility and trade. However, ageing assets, climate change
impacts (e.g., extreme weather, rising sea levels), and hybrid threats ranging
from natural disasters to cyber attacks and conflicts pose growing risks to
their resilience and functionality. This review paper explores how emerging
digital technologies, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI), can enhance
damage assessment and monitoring of transport infrastructure. A systematic
literature review examines existing AI models and datasets for assessing damage
in roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure impacted by natural
disasters. Special focus is given to the unique challenges and opportunities
associated with bridge damage detection due to their structural complexity and
critical role in connectivity. The integration of SAR (Synthetic Aperture
Radar) data with AI models is also discussed, with the review revealing a
critical research gap: a scarcity of studies applying AI models to SAR data for
comprehensive bridge damage assessment. Therefore, this review aims to identify
the research gaps and provide foundations for AI-driven solutions for assessing
and monitoring critical transport infrastructures.

Motivation: 解决高维非线性函数全局优化问题，尤其是传统方法难以处理的高维（如超过80维）情况。

Method: 结合区间分析和GPU并行计算，通过迭代排除不可能存在全局最小值的区域，并采用单程序多数据（SPMD）编程风格和变量循环技术提高效率。

Result: 成功在10个多模态基准测试函数（包括Ackley、Griewank等）中，最高达到10,000维的情况下，找到并包围全局最小值。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维非线性函数全局优化中表现出色，显著优于文献中的现有结果，得益于GPU架构的独特设计和实现。

Abstract: This paper introduces a GPU-based complete search method to enclose the
global minimum of a nonlinear function subject to simple bounds on the
variables. Using interval analysis, coupled with the computational power and
architecture of GPU, the method iteratively rules out the regions in the search
domain where the global minimum cannot exist and leaves a finite set of regions
where the global minimum must exist. For effectiveness, because of the rigor of
interval analysis, the method is guaranteed to enclose the global minimum of
the nonlinear function even in the presence of rounding errors. For efficiency,
the method employs a novel GPU-based single program, single data parallel
programming style to circumvent major GPU performance bottlenecks, and a
variable cycling technique is also integrated into the method to reduce
computational cost when minimizing large-scale nonlinear functions. The method
is validated by minimizing 10 multimodal benchmark test functions with scalable
dimensions, including the well-known Ackley function, Griewank function, Levy
function, and Rastrigin function. These benchmark test functions represent
grand challenges of global optimization, and enclosing the guaranteed global
minimum of these benchmark test functions with more than 80 dimensions has not
been reported in the literature. Our method completely searches the feasible
domain and successfully encloses the guaranteed global minimum of these 10
benchmark test functions with up to 10,000 dimensions using only one GPU in a
reasonable computation time, far exceeding the reported results in the
literature due to the unique method design and implementation based on GPU
architecture.

Result: 证明了在经验风险最小化框架下，所有误差项均可控，数值积分能以高概率逼近理论值。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据集增大和网络容量自适应增加时，能以任意小误差逼近理论积分值。

Abstract: This paper provides a proof of the consistency of sparse grid quadrature for
numerical integration of high dimensional distributions. In a first step, a
transport map is learned that normalizes the distribution to a noise
distribution on the unit cube. This step is built on the statistical learning
theory of neural ordinary differential equations, which has been established
recently. Secondly, the composition of the generative map with the quantity of
interest is integrated numerically using the Clenshaw-Curtis sparse grid
quadrature. A decomposition of the total numerical error in quadrature error
and statistical error is provided. As main result it is proven in the framework
of empirical risk minimization that all error terms can be controlled in the
sense of PAC (probably approximately correct) learning and with high
probability the numerical integral approximates the theoretical value up to an
arbitrary small error in the limit where the data set size is growing and the
network capacity is increased adaptively.

Motivation: 现有神经网络架构依赖先验方程知识或固定离散化，而NESCFN通过嵌入熵稳定设计原则，实现完全数据驱动的物理一致性动态发现。

Method: 联合学习数值通量函数和对应熵，确保守恒和熵耗散，适用于双曲守恒律系统的长期稳定性和保真度。

Conclusion: NESCFN在无未来时间解轮廓的情况下，仍能实现稳定性和守恒性，为数据驱动方法提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose a neural entropy-stable conservative flux form neural network
(NESCFN) for learning hyperbolic conservation laws and their associated entropy
functions directly from solution trajectories, without requiring any predefined
numerical discretization. While recent neural network architectures have
successfully integrated classical numerical principles into learned models,
most rely on prior knowledge of the governing equations or assume a fixed
discretization. Our approach removes this dependency by embedding
entropy-stable design principles into the learning process itself, enabling the
discovery of physically consistent dynamics in a fully data-driven setting. By
jointly learning both the numerical flux function and a corresponding entropy,
the proposed method ensures conservation and entropy dissipation, critical for
long-term stability and fidelity in the system of hyperbolic conservation laws.
Numerical results demonstrate that the method achieves stability and
conservation over extended time horizons and accurately captures shock
propagation speeds, even without oracle access to future-time solution profiles
in the training data.

Conclusion: 对比训练的基础模型结合光谱感知解码器，可以推动精密恒星光谱学的发展。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.
Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework
that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar
spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical
information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral
datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support
diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves
pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed
by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different
instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve
spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between
spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information
between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework
enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We
demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets
improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and
chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and
precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.
Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities
offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively
trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance
precision stellar spectroscopy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高斯喷绘技术在扩展到大场景时因分区导致的边界伪影、训练复杂性和GPU内存限制问题。

Method: 采用混合数据结构（高斯层次结构与顺序点树）和轻量级缓存视图调度系统，动态流式传输相关高斯数据。

Result: 实现了无缝多尺度重建和复杂场景的交互式可视化，支持从空中俯瞰到地面细节的实时渲染。

Conclusion: A LoD of Gaussians框架有效解决了大规模高斯场景的渲染和训练问题，适用于非结构化场景。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view
synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of
small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on
partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at
chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly
suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with
street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU
memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce
A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale
Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our
method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a
Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the
relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with
Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a
lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to
support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable
seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex
scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLM）作为市场代理时可能出现的合谋行为，分析了沟通能力、模型选择和环境压力对合谋倾向的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在社会经济互动中的应用增加，识别其潜在不良行为（如合谋）变得至关重要。

Method: 通过模拟连续双重拍卖市场，控制实验分析LLM代理的合谋行为，考察沟通、模型和环境压力的影响。

Result: 直接沟通增加合谋倾向，不同模型的合谋倾向各异，环境压力（如监管）影响合谋行为。

Conclusion: 研究强调了部署LLM市场代理时的经济和伦理考量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
autonomous agents with rapidly expanding applications in various domains. As
these agents increasingly engage in socioeconomic interactions, identifying
their potential for undesirable behavior becomes essential. In this work, we
examine scenarios where they can choose to collude, defined as secretive
cooperation that harms another party. To systematically study this, we
investigate the behavior of LLM agents acting as sellers in simulated
continuous double auction markets. Through a series of controlled experiments,
we analyze how parameters such as the ability to communicate, choice of model,
and presence of environmental pressures affect the stability and emergence of
seller collusion. We find that direct seller communication increases collusive
tendencies, the propensity to collude varies across models, and environmental
pressures, such as oversight and urgency from authority figures, influence
collusive behavior. Our findings highlight important economic and ethical
considerations for the deployment of LLM-based market agents.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习（TL）的可见光通信（VLC）室内定位方法，显著提升了定位精度、降低了能耗和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中精确的室内定位至关重要，但VLC定位受环境变化（如光照波动和障碍物）影响。

Method: 采用迁移学习框架结合深度神经网络（DNN），利用真实工厂数据优化定位性能。

Result: 定位精度提升47%，能耗降低32%，计算时间减少40%，且仅需30%数据即可达到类似精度。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、适应性强，适合工业4.0应用，具有成本效益和可扩展性。

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial in industrial environments. Visible
Light Communication (VLC) has emerged as a promising solution, offering high
accuracy, energy efficiency, and minimal electromagnetic interference. However,
VLC-based indoor localization faces challenges due to environmental
variability, such as lighting fluctuations and obstacles. To address these
challenges, we propose a Transfer Learning (TL)-based approach for VLC-based
indoor localization. Using real-world data collected at a BOSCH factory, the TL
framework integrates a deep neural network (DNN) to improve localization
accuracy by 47\%, reduce energy consumption by 32\%, and decrease computational
time by 40\% compared to the conventional models. The proposed solution is
highly adaptable under varying environmental conditions and achieves similar
accuracy with only 30\% of the dataset, making it a cost-efficient and scalable
option for industrial applications in Industry 4.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通信系统在处理多模态数据时效率低下，缺乏统一的令牌表示方法，因此提出UniToCom以解决这些问题。

Method: 采用GenIB原则优化令牌表示，开发σ-GenIB解决自回归建模中的方差崩溃问题，并使用基于因果Transformer的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）统一处理离散和连续令牌。

Result: 仿真结果表明，UniToCom在动态信道条件下优于基线方法，提升了通信效率和计算性能。

Conclusion: UniToCom通过结合令牌处理和MLLM，为下一代智能通信提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案，支持多模态理解和生成。

Abstract: This letter proposes UniToCom, a unified token communication paradigm that
treats tokens as the fundamental units for both processing and wireless
transmission. Specifically, to enable efficient token representations, we
propose a generative information bottleneck (GenIB) principle, which
facilitates the learning of tokens that preserve essential information while
supporting reliable generation across multiple modalities. By doing this,
GenIB-based tokenization is conducive to improving the communication efficiency
and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we develop $\sigma$-GenIB
to address the challenges of variance collapse in autoregressive modeling,
maintaining representational diversity and stability. Moreover, we employ a
causal Transformer-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) at the receiver
to unify the processing of both discrete and continuous tokens under the
next-token prediction paradigm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed UniToCom compared to baselines under dynamic
channel conditions. By integrating token processing with MLLMs, UniToCom
enables scalable and generalizable communication in favor of multimodal
understanding and generation, providing a potential solution for
next-generation intelligent communications.

Method: 通过ANOVA、卡方检验和蒙特卡洛模拟评估安全策略的有效性，分析网络层、设备层及云与AI系统的漏洞。

Result: 后量子加密和AI驱动异常检测效果显著，但计算资源需求高；区块链和零信任结构增强安全性，但需基础设施改进。

Conclusion: 需改进加密技术、AI威胁检测和自适应安全模型，以平衡性能、效率和实时性。

Abstract: Smart homes that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices face increasing
cybersecurity risks, posing significant challenges to these environments. The
study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them
into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from
cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum
encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in
enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant
challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures
builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing
infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness
through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack
sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the
requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced
threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance
between performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart
home ecosystems.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: AutoAdv是一个自动化对抗性提示生成框架，用于评估和暴露大型语言模型（LLM）的安全漏洞。通过动态多轮攻击方法，攻击成功率高达86%，揭示了当前安全机制的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）易受越狱攻击，需要系统评估其安全漏洞。

Method: 利用参数化攻击者LLM生成语义伪装的恶意提示，采用多轮攻击方法，包括角色扮演、误导和上下文操纵。

Result: 攻击成功率达86%，显示现有安全机制对多轮攻击的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前安全机制仍需改进，亟需更强大的防御策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities to
jailbreaking attacks: carefully crafted malicious inputs intended to circumvent
safety guardrails and elicit harmful responses. As such, we present AutoAdv, a
novel framework that automates adversarial prompt generation to systematically
evaluate and expose vulnerabilities in LLM safety mechanisms. Our approach
leverages a parametric attacker LLM to produce semantically disguised malicious
prompts through strategic rewriting techniques, specialized system prompts, and
optimized hyperparameter configurations. The primary contribution of our work
is a dynamic, multi-turn attack methodology that analyzes failed jailbreak
attempts and iteratively generates refined follow-up prompts, leveraging
techniques such as roleplaying, misdirection, and contextual manipulation. We
quantitatively evaluate attack success rate (ASR) using the StrongREJECT
(arXiv:2402.10260 [cs.CL]) framework across sequential interaction turns.
Through extensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art models--including
ChatGPT, Llama, and DeepSeek--we reveal significant vulnerabilities, with our
automated attacks achieving jailbreak success rates of up to 86% for harmful
content generation. Our findings reveal that current safety mechanisms remain
susceptible to sophisticated multi-turn attacks, emphasizing the urgent need
for more robust defense strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉推理方面扩展了LLMs，但也引入了新的漏洞，使其容易受到多模态越狱攻击。现有防御方法未能解决根本问题，导致防御效果不佳。

Method: 论文分析了有害多模态令牌如何绕过MLLMs的安全机制，并提出SafePTR框架，选择性修剪有害令牌并恢复良性特征。

Result: 实验表明，SafePTR在三种MLLMs和五个基准测试中显著提升了安全性，且不影响模型效率。

Conclusion: SafePTR是一种高效且无需训练的防御方法，能有效应对多模态越狱攻击。

Abstract: By incorporating visual inputs, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
extend LLMs to support visual reasoning. However, this integration also
introduces new vulnerabilities, making MLLMs susceptible to multimodal
jailbreak attacks and hindering their safe deployment.Existing defense methods,
including Image-to-Text Translation, Safe Prompting, and Multimodal Safety
Tuning, attempt to address this by aligning multimodal inputs with LLMs'
built-in safeguards.Yet, they fall short in uncovering root causes of
multimodal vulnerabilities, particularly how harmful multimodal tokens trigger
jailbreak in MLLMs? Consequently, they remain vulnerable to text-driven
multimodal jailbreaks, often exhibiting overdefensive behaviors and imposing
heavy training overhead.To bridge this gap, we present an comprehensive
analysis of where, how and which harmful multimodal tokens bypass safeguards in
MLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that less than 1% tokens in early-middle layers
are responsible for inducing unsafe behaviors, highlighting the potential of
precisely removing a small subset of harmful tokens, without requiring safety
tuning, can still effectively improve safety against jailbreaks. Motivated by
this, we propose Safe Prune-then-Restore (SafePTR), an training-free defense
framework that selectively prunes harmful tokens at vulnerable layers while
restoring benign features at subsequent layers.Without incurring additional
computational overhead, SafePTR significantly enhances the safety of MLLMs
while preserving efficiency. Extensive evaluations across three MLLMs and five
benchmarks demonstrate SafePTR's state-of-the-art performance in mitigating
jailbreak risks without compromising utility.

Result: 开发了自动分析食品晶体大小和数量的工具，提高了效率和准确性，并通过隐私保护平台部署。

Conclusion: 隐私保护平台成功解决了制造商的数据共享问题，未来可进一步扩展应用。

Abstract: Small- and medium-sized manufacturers need innovative data tools but, because
of competition and privacy concerns, often do not want to share their
proprietary data with researchers who might be interested in helping. This
paper introduces a privacy-preserving platform by which manufacturers may
safely share their data with researchers through secure methods, so that those
researchers then create innovative tools to solve the manufacturers' real-world
problems, and then provide tools that execute solutions back onto the platform
for others to use with privacy and confidentiality guarantees. We illustrate
this problem through a particular use case which addresses an important problem
in the large-scale manufacturing of food crystals, which is that quality
control relies on image analysis tools. Previous to our research, food crystals
in the images were manually counted, which required substantial and
time-consuming human efforts, but we have developed and deployed a crystal
analysis tool which makes this process both more rapid and accurate. The tool
enables automatic characterization of the crystal size distribution and numbers
from microscope images while the natural imperfections from the sample
preparation are automatically removed; a machine learning model to count high
resolution translucent crystals and agglomeration of crystals was also
developed to aid in these efforts. The resulting algorithm was then packaged
for real-world use on the factory floor via a web-based app secured through the
originating privacy-preserving platform, allowing manufacturers to use it while
keeping their proprietary data secure. After demonstrating this full process,
future directions are also explored.

Conclusion: 本文为安全洗牌器的研究和实践提供了系统化的指导，并指出了未来研究的潜在方向。

Abstract: Ishai et al. (FOCS'06) introduced secure shuffling as an efficient building
block for private data aggregation. Recently, the field of differential privacy
has revived interest in secure shufflers by highlighting the privacy
amplification they can provide in various computations. Although several works
argue for the utility of secure shufflers, they often treat them as black
boxes; overlooking the practical vulnerabilities and performance trade-offs of
existing implementations. This leaves a central question open: what makes a
good secure shuffler?
  This survey addresses that question by identifying, categorizing, and
comparing 26 secure protocols that realize the necessary shuffling
functionality. To enable a meaningful comparison, we adapt and unify existing
security definitions into a consistent set of properties. We also present an
overview of privacy-preserving technologies that rely on secure shufflers,
offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate protocols, and outline
promising directions for future work.

Method: 使用DeepCASE评估标签不平衡对警报分类的影响。

Result: 标签不平衡影响分类性能和解释性，调整检测规则可改善。

Conclusion: 传统方法优化输入数据质量可提升自动化效果。

Abstract: Automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) plays a prominent role in
alert classification and incident escalation. However, automated methods must
be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect
performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions.
In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification
of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the
state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label
imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the
classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the
detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit
the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods
such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to
improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.

Abstract: Deep learning offers transformative potential in medical imaging, yet its
clinical adoption is frequently hampered by challenges such as data scarcity,
distribution shifts, and the need for robust task generalization. Prompt-based
methodologies have emerged as a pivotal strategy to guide deep learning models,
providing flexible, domain-specific adaptations that significantly enhance
model performance and adaptability without extensive retraining. This
systematic review critically examines the burgeoning landscape of prompt
engineering in medical imaging. We dissect diverse prompt modalities, including
textual instructions, visual prompts, and learnable embeddings, and analyze
their integration for core tasks such as image generation, segmentation, and
classification. Our synthesis reveals how these mechanisms improve
task-specific outcomes by enhancing accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency
and reducing reliance on manual feature engineering while fostering greater
model interpretability by making the model's guidance explicit. Despite
substantial advancements, we identify persistent challenges, particularly in
prompt design optimization, data heterogeneity, and ensuring scalability for
clinical deployment. Finally, this review outlines promising future
trajectories, including advanced multimodal prompting and robust clinical
integration, underscoring the critical role of prompt-driven AI in accelerating
the revolution of diagnostics and personalized treatment planning in medicine.

Conclusion: CRISP-SAM2通过跨模态交互和语义提示显著提升了多器官医学分割的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image
processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop
effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current
multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details,
dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing
these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal
Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a
promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual
descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual
inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive
cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into
the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information.
To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting
strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of
challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy
for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical
imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on
seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models.
Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby
confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations
mentioned earlier. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: ResNet+模型在肺癌和肺部疾病预测中优于基线模型，具有更高的性能和更低的计算成本，代码已公开。

Abstract: The use of deep learning (DL) in medical image analysis has significantly
improved the ability to predict lung cancer. In this study, we introduce a
novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, named ResNet+, which is
based on the established ResNet framework. This model is specifically designed
to improve the prediction of lung cancer and diseases using the images. To
address the challenge of missing feature information that occurs during the
downsampling process in CNNs, we integrate the ResNet-D module, a variant
designed to enhance feature extraction capabilities by modifying the
downsampling layers, into the traditional ResNet model. Furthermore, a
convolutional attention module was incorporated into the bottleneck layers to
enhance model generalization by allowing the network to focus on relevant
regions of the input images. We evaluated the proposed model using five public
datasets, comprising lung cancer (LC2500 $n$=3183, IQ-OTH/NCCD $n$=1336, and
LCC $n$=25000 images) and lung disease (ChestXray $n$=5856, and COVIDx-CT
$n$=425024 images). To address class imbalance, we used data augmentation
techniques to artificially increase the representation of underrepresented
classes in the training dataset. The experimental results show that ResNet+
model demonstrated remarkable accuracy/F1, reaching 98.14/98.14\% on the
LC25000 dataset and 99.25/99.13\% on the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset. Furthermore, the
ResNet+ model saved computational cost compared to the original ResNet series
in predicting lung cancer images. The proposed model outperformed the baseline
models on publicly available datasets, achieving better performance metrics.

trained on existing public datasets. Our analysis indicates that these gains
are directly attributable to the 16x larger-scale tumor annotations and
indirectly supported by the 24 additional surrounding anatomical structures. As
the largest and most comprehensive resource of its kind, PanTS offers a new
benchmark for developing and evaluating AI models in pancreatic CT analysis.

*Rongchang Zhao,Huanchi Liu,Jian Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SWinMamba的新方法，通过蛇形窗口序列和双向状态空间模型，实现了医学图像中血管的准确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 血管分割在医学图像中至关重要，但现有方法常因血管细长和先验建模不足导致分割结果不连续。

Method: SWinMamba结合蛇形窗口序列和双向状态空间模型，通过SWToken自适应分割图像，BAM整合局部特征，SFFU增强特征表示。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，SWinMamba能够生成完整且连续的血管分割结果。

Conclusion: SWinMamba通过创新建模血管连续性，显著提升了血管分割的准确性和完整性。

Abstract: Vascular segmentation in medical images is crucial for disease diagnosis and
surgical navigation. However, the segmented vascular structure is often
discontinuous due to its slender nature and inadequate prior modeling. In this
paper, we propose a novel Serpentine Window Mamba (SWinMamba) to achieve
accurate vascular segmentation. The proposed SWinMamba innovatively models the
continuity of slender vascular structures by incorporating serpentine window
sequences into bidirectional state space models. The serpentine window
sequences enable efficient feature capturing by adaptively guiding global
visual context modeling to the vascular structure. Specifically, the Serpentine
Window Tokenizer (SWToken) adaptively splits the input image using overlapping
serpentine window sequences, enabling flexible receptive fields (RFs) for
vascular structure modeling. The Bidirectional Aggregation Module (BAM)
integrates coherent local features in the RFs for vascular continuity
representation. In addition, dual-domain learning with Spatial-Frequency Fusion
Unit (SFFU) is designed to enhance the feature representation of vascular
structure. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that
the proposed SWinMamba achieves superior performance with complete and
connected vessels.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为S2DNets的双网络模型，用于自监督偏置场校正，通过引入分段结构约束和偏置场平滑性，有效去除MR图像中的非均匀强度并保留更多结构细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MR图像中存在显著的强度不均匀性，影响医学分析的定性和定量结果。现有无监督深度学习模型仅关注全局外观学习，忽略了图像结构和偏置场平滑性的约束，导致校正结果失真。

Method: 提出S2DNets，通过引入分段结构约束和偏置场平滑性进行网络训练，以自监督方式校正偏置场。

Result: 在临床和模拟MR数据集上的实验表明，S2DNets优于传统和基于深度学习的模型，并在下游MR图像分割任务中验证了其效果。

Conclusion: S2DNets通过结构和平滑性约束，显著改善了MR图像的校正效果，为医学分析提供了更高质量的图像。

Abstract: MR imaging techniques are of great benefit to disease diagnosis. However, due
to the limitation of MR devices, significant intensity inhomogeneity often
exists in imaging results, which impedes both qualitative and quantitative
medical analysis. Recently, several unsupervised deep learning-based models
have been proposed for MR image improvement. However, these models merely
concentrate on global appearance learning, and neglect constraints from image
structures and smoothness of bias field, leading to distorted corrected
results. In this paper, novel structure and smoothness constrained dual
networks, named S2DNets, are proposed aiming to self-supervised bias field
correction. S2DNets introduce piece-wise structural constraints and smoothness
of bias field for network training to effectively remove non-uniform intensity
and retain much more structural details. Extensive experiments executed on both
clinical and simulated MR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms
other conventional and deep learning-based models. In addition to comparison on
visual metrics, downstream MR image segmentation tasks are also used to
evaluate the impact of the proposed model. The source code is available at:

*Ahmad Soliman,Ron Keuth,Marian Himstedt*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BronchoGAN提出了一种结合解剖学约束的图像翻译方法，通过条件GAN和深度图像中间表示，实现了不同支气管镜输入域的鲁棒翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于支气管镜图像数据有限，需要一种方法能够合成高质量图像以训练深度学习模型，并实现跨域翻译。

Method: 提出BronchoGAN，将解剖学约束（如支气管孔匹配）集成到条件GAN中，并使用基础模型生成的深度图像作为中间表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能成功将不同输入域（如虚拟支气管镜、模型）的图像翻译为逼真的人体气道图像，解剖学结构得到保留，FID、SSIM和Dice系数显著提升。

Conclusion: BronchoGAN通过解剖学约束和深度图像中间表示，填补了公共支气管镜图像数据的空白，为大规模数据集生成提供了可能。

Abstract: The limited availability of bronchoscopy images makes image synthesis
particularly interesting for training deep learning models. Robust image
translation across different domains -- virtual bronchoscopy, phantom as well
as in-vivo and ex-vivo image data -- is pivotal for clinical applications. This
paper proposes BronchoGAN introducing anatomical constraints for image-to-image
translation being integrated into a conditional GAN. In particular, we force
bronchial orifices to match across input and output images. We further propose
to use foundation model-generated depth images as intermediate representation
ensuring robustness across a variety of input domains establishing models with
substantially less reliance on individual training datasets. Moreover our
intermediate depth image representation allows to easily construct paired image
data for training. Our experiments showed that input images from different
domains (e.g. virtual bronchoscopy, phantoms) can be successfully translated to
images mimicking realistic human airway appearance. We demonstrated that
anatomical settings (i.e. bronchial orifices) can be robustly preserved with
our approach which is shown qualitatively and quantitatively by means of
improved FID, SSIM and dice coefficients scores. Our anatomical constraints
enabled an improvement in the Dice coefficient of up to 0.43 for synthetic
images. Through foundation models for intermediate depth representations,
bronchial orifice segmentation integrated as anatomical constraints into
conditional GANs we are able to robustly translate images from different
bronchoscopy input domains. BronchoGAN allows to incorporate public CT scan
data (virtual bronchoscopy) in order to generate large-scale bronchoscopy image
datasets with realistic appearance. BronchoGAN enables to bridge the gap of
missing public bronchoscopy images.

KDS-based pipeline on multi-source data and highlight the importance of dataset
balance in multi-institutional medical imaging evaluation.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Estimating brain age from structural MRI has emerged as a powerful tool for
characterizing normative and pathological aging. In this work, we explore
contrastive learning as a scalable and robust alternative to supervised
approaches for brain age estimation. We introduce a novel contrastive loss
function, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$, and evaluate it across multiple public
neuroimaging datasets comprising over 20,000 scans. Our experiments reveal four
key findings. First, scaling pre-training on diverse, multi-site data
consistently improves generalization performance, cutting external mean
absolute error (MAE) nearly in half. Second, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ is robust to
site-related confounds, maintaining low scanner-predictability as training size
increases. Third, contrastive models reliably capture accelerated aging in
patients with cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, as shown through
brain age gap analysis, ROC curves, and longitudinal trends. Lastly, unlike
supervised baselines, $\mathcal{L}^{exp}$ maintains a strong correlation
between brain age accuracy and downstream diagnostic performance, supporting
its potential as a foundation model for neuroimaging. These results position
contrastive learning as a promising direction for building generalizable and
clinically meaningful brain representations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ADA-SAM的新型多任务学习框架，用于医学图像分割，结合分类和分割任务，通过梯度反馈机制提升性能，在有限标注数据下表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割依赖大量标注数据，成本高且易出错，需要更高效、自动化的方法。

Method: 基于Segment Anything (SAM)框架，结合分类激活图和梯度反馈机制，优化半监督分割任务。

Result: 在真实临床数据上验证，ADA-SAM在有限标注数据下性能优于全监督和半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: ADA-SAM提供了一种高效、自动化的医学图像分割解决方案，适用于标注数据有限的情况。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a key task in the imaging workflow, influencing
many image-based decisions. Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models
rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through
manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone
process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient
methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated,
domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask
learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class
activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the
semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything
(SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient
feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation
and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and
improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world
clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our
proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines
by double digits in limited label settings. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT在肺癌筛查中应用广泛，但放射科医生短缺限制了其规模化解读。TANGERINE旨在提供一个高效、易用的解决方案。

Method: TANGERINE基于自监督学习预训练，采用3D掩码自编码器框架，可在有限计算资源和数据下快速微调。

Result: 在14种疾病分类任务中达到最优性能，包括肺癌和多种呼吸系统疾病，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: TANGERINE的开源、轻量设计为下一代医学影像工具提供了基础，有望将肺癌筛查扩展为全面的呼吸系统疾病管理。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening
(LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a
generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related
early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of
radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a
computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT
analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can
be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with
limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained
from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning,
thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label
efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of
fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000
thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public
datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease
classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases,
while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a
masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable
solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive
models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest
computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays
the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools
that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular
focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management
in high-risk populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战AI系统在经济和认知秩序中的能力假设，探讨其对人类自主性和制度演化的影响。

Method: 运用米塞斯先验推理和奥地利企业家理论，分析AI在经济协调中的功能缺失。

Result: AI无法完成经济协调的核心功能，主流伦理框架与自由主义秩序冲突，且AI无法生成规范或承担责任。

Conclusion: AI辩论关乎人类自主性，奥地利学派提供了对抗计算社会控制的唯一连贯替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a praxeological analysis of artificial intelligence and
algorithmic governance, challenging assumptions about the capacity of machine
systems to sustain economic and epistemic order. Drawing on Misesian a priori
reasoning and Austrian theories of entrepreneurship, we argue that AI systems
are incapable of performing the core functions of economic coordination:
interpreting ends, discovering means, and communicating subjective value
through prices. Where neoclassical and behavioural models treat decisions as
optimisation under constraint, we frame them as purposive actions under
uncertainty.
  We critique dominant ethical AI frameworks such as Fairness, Accountability,
and Transparency (FAT) as extensions of constructivist rationalism, which
conflict with a liberal order grounded in voluntary action and property rights.
Attempts to encode moral reasoning in algorithms reflect a misunderstanding of
ethics and economics. However complex, AI systems cannot originate norms,
interpret institutions, or bear responsibility. They remain opaque, misaligned,
and inert.
  Using the concept of epistemic scarcity, we explore how information abundance
degrades truth discernment, enabling both entrepreneurial insight and soft
totalitarianism. Our analysis ends with a civilisational claim: the debate over
AI concerns the future of human autonomy, institutional evolution, and reasoned
choice. The Austrian tradition, focused on action, subjectivity, and
spontaneous order, offers the only coherent alternative to rising computational
social control.

*Eloy Peña-Asensio,Fabio Ferrari*

Main category: astro-ph.EP

TL;DR: 该研究评估了HDBSCAN算法在无监督流星群识别中的性能，并与CAMS查找表方法进行比较，结果表明HDBSCAN在统计一致性上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流星群的准确识别对其起源和演化的理解至关重要，但重叠簇和背景噪声增加了分类难度，尤其是对依赖流星雨观测的任务（如ESA的LUMIO任务）。

Method: 使用HDBSCAN算法分析CAMS流星轨道数据库v3.0，比较三种特征向量（LUTAB、ORBIT、GEO），并通过匈牙利算法与CAMS分类对齐，评估聚类性能。

Result: HDBSCAN确认了39个流星群（21个与CAMS高度一致），ORBIT向量识别了30个流星群（13个匹配度高）。eom方法表现最佳。

Conclusion: HDBSCAN在统计一致性上优于查找表方法，但需进一步验证其物理有效性，展示了其作为流星群识别替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding
their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise
hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that
rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters.
This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised
meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established
Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze
the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS
geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted
geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes
and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters
with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal
mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,
Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis
further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39
meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies
30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose
identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior
performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful
selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally
consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical
coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically
consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further
validation is needed to assess physical validity.

Conclusion: 结合先进机器学习模型与STEM数据，有望实现高效、稳健的微观结构表征。

Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and
optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in
energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising
cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its
electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as
grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping
methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough
transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling
complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale
microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach
for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated
generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the
analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning
architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional
Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated,
using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM
algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin
Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer
achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural
predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary
delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring
the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based
image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine
learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural
characterization.

Abstract: This study presents an exploratory evaluation of Music Generation Systems
(MGS) within contemporary music production workflows by examining eight
open-source systems. The evaluation framework combines technical insights with
practical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate
the practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative,
non-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology
as a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing
qualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through
quantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity
across both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning
composition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses
limitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities
for workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools
while maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function
primarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human
expertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural
coherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks
demanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a
structured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music
creation. It identifies methodological refinements necessary for subsequent
comprehensive evaluations and determines viable areas for AI integration as
collaborative tools in creative workflows. The research provides
empirically-grounded insights to guide future development in the field.

Motivation: 外语口音转换（FAC）在语音处理中仍具挑战性，研究旨在利用LLM在TTS任务中的成功经验，解决FAC任务中的数据稀缺和语音质量问题。

Method: 1. 提出SpeechCodeVAE模型，将CTC直接集成到语音内容标记化中；2. 采用多任务学习策略联合训练FAC和TTS模块；3. 引入SpeechRestorer后处理模块优化LLM输出。

Result: 实验验证了SpeechCodeVAE的标记化效果，多任务学习加速了收敛并提升了语音质量，SpeechRestorer减少了LLM推理中的随机错误并改善了韵律连续性。

Conclusion: SpeechAccentLLM框架通过创新模型和多任务学习策略，有效解决了FAC任务中的挑战，为语音处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foreign accent conversion (FAC) in speech processing remains a challenging
task. Building on the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) in
Text-to-Speech (TTS) tasks, this study investigates the adaptation of LLM-based
techniques for FAC, which we term SpeechAccentLLM. At the core of this
framework, we introduce SpeechCodeVAE, the first model to integrate
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) directly into codebook
discretization for speech content tokenization. This novel architecture
generates tokens with a unique "locality" property, as validated by experiments
demonstrating optimal trade-offs among content faithfulness, temporal
coherence, and structural recoverability. Then, to address data scarcity for
the FAC module, we adopted a multitask learning strategy that jointly trains
the FAC and TTS modules. Beyond mitigating data limitations, this approach
yielded accelerated convergence and superior speech quality compared to
standalone FAC training. Moreover, leveraging the salient properties of our
discrete speech representations, we introduce SpeechRestorer, a postprocessing
architecture designed to refine LLM-generated outputs. This module effectively
mitigates stochastic errors prevalent in LLM inference pipelines while
enhancing prosodic continuity, as validated by ablation experiments.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了为日本偶像团体风格歌曲构建的IdolSongsJp语料库，用于音乐信息处理技术的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本偶像团体歌曲具有复杂的音乐结构和制作技术，适合挑战性条件下的音乐信息处理技术评估。

Method: 通过专业作曲家创作15首偶像风格歌曲，构建包含多轨音频和标注的语料库。

Result: 语料库展示了多样性，并成功应用于多种音乐信息处理技术的评估。

Conclusion: IdolSongsJp为音乐信息处理研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Japanese idol groups, comprising performers known as "idols," are an
indispensable part of Japanese pop culture. They frequently appear in live
concerts and television programs, entertaining audiences with their singing and
dancing. Similar to other J-pop songs, idol group music covers a wide range of
styles, with various types of chord progressions and instrumental arrangements.
These tracks often feature numerous instruments and employ complex mastering
techniques, resulting in high signal loudness. Additionally, most songs include
a song division (utawari) structure, in which members alternate between singing
solos and performing together. Hence, these songs are well-suited for
benchmarking various music information processing techniques such as singer
diarization, music source separation, and automatic chord estimation under
challenging conditions. Focusing on these characteristics, we constructed a
song corpus titled IdolSongsJp by commissioning professional composers to
create 15 tracks in the style of Japanese idol groups. This corpus includes not
only mastered audio tracks but also stems for music source separation, dry
vocal tracks, and chord annotations. This paper provides a detailed description
of the corpus, demonstrates its diversity through comparisons with real-world
idol group songs, and presents its application in evaluating several music
information processing techniques.

*Hitoshi Suda,Shinnosuke Takamichi,Satoru Fukayama*

Main category: eess.AS

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音受欢迎程度在社交互动中很重要，如伴侣选择和广告。提供参考样本可帮助用户调整说话风格，促进沟通。

Method: 训练一个受欢迎程度预测器，自动标注大规模语音合成语料库，并开发语音转换方法。

Result: 预测器输出与人类评分显著相关，方法有效控制语音受欢迎程度且保留说话者身份和内容。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效调整语音受欢迎程度，适用于社交互动和广告等领域。

Abstract: Perceived voice likability plays a crucial role in various social
interactions, such as partner selection and advertising. A system that provides
reference likable voice samples tailored to target audiences would enable users
to adjust their speaking style and voice quality, facilitating smoother
communication. To this end, we propose a voice conversion method that controls
the likability of input speech while preserving both speaker identity and
linguistic content. To improve training data scalability, we train a likability
predictor on an existing voice likability dataset and employ it to
automatically annotate a large speech synthesis corpus with likability ratings.
Experimental evaluations reveal a significant correlation between the
predictor's outputs and human-provided likability ratings. Subjective and
objective evaluations further demonstrate that the proposed approach
effectively controls voice likability while preserving both speaker identity
and linguistic content.

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了QHM、ARMA模型和神经网络的优势，显著提升了语音合成的性能。

Abstract: Vocoders, encoding speech signals into acoustic features and allowing for
speech signal reconstruction from them, have been studied for decades.
Recently, the rise of deep learning has particularly driven the development of
neural vocoders to generate high-quality speech signals. On the other hand, the
existing end-to-end neural vocoders suffer from a black-box nature that blinds
the speech production mechanism and the intrinsic structure of speech,
resulting in the ambiguity of separately modeling source excitation and
resonance characteristics and the loss of flexibly synthesizing or modifying
speech with high quality. Moreover, their sequence-wise waveform generation
usually requires complicated networks, leading to substantial time consumption.
In this work, inspired by the quasi-harmonic model (QHM) that represents speech
as sparse components, we combine the neural network and QHM synthesis process
to propose a novel framework for the neural vocoder. Accordingly, speech
signals can be encoded into autoregressive moving average (ARMA) functions to
model the resonance characteristics, yielding accurate estimates of the
amplitudes and phases of quasi-harmonics at any frequency. Subsequently, the
speech can be resynthesized and arbitrarily modified in terms of pitch shifting
and time stretching with high quality, whereas the time consumption and network
size decrease. The experiments indicate that the proposed method leverages the
strengths of QHM, the ARMA model, and neural networks, leading to the
outperformance of our methods over other methods in terms of generation speed,
synthesis quality, and modification flexibility.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文提出‘Data Agent’概念，利用大语言模型（LLMs）增强数据系统的语义理解、推理和规划能力，以优化Data+AI应用的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Data+AI系统依赖人工专家协调，缺乏语义理解、推理和规划能力，LLMs的成功为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出‘Data Agent’架构，整合知识理解、推理和规划能力，解决数据任务协调问题。

Result: 展示了多种数据代理系统实例（如数据科学代理、数据分析代理等），并讨论了设计挑战。

Conclusion: Data Agent有望通过LLMs技术革新数据系统，但仍面临开放挑战。

Abstract: Traditional Data+AI systems utilize data-driven techniques to optimize
performance, but they rely heavily on human experts to orchestrate system
pipelines, enabling them to adapt to changes in data, queries, tasks, and
environments. For instance, while there are numerous data science tools
available, developing a pipeline planning system to coordinate these tools
remains challenging. This difficulty arises because existing Data+AI systems
have limited capabilities in semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning.
Fortunately, we have witnessed the success of large language models (LLMs) in
enhancing semantic understanding, reasoning, and planning abilities. It is
crucial to incorporate LLM techniques to revolutionize data systems for
orchestrating Data+AI applications effectively.
  To achieve this, we propose the concept of a 'Data Agent' - a comprehensive
architecture designed to orchestrate Data+AI ecosystems, which focuses on
tackling data-related tasks by integrating knowledge comprehension, reasoning,
and planning capabilities. We delve into the challenges involved in designing
data agents, such as understanding data/queries/environments/tools,
orchestrating pipelines/workflows, optimizing and executing pipelines, and
fostering pipeline self-reflection. Furthermore, we present examples of data
agent systems, including a data science agent, data analytics agents (such as
unstructured data analytics agent, semantic structured data analytics agent,
data lake analytics agent, and multi-modal data analytics agent), and a
database administrator (DBA) agent. We also outline several open challenges
associated with designing data agent systems.

efficiency, and a novel Cross-Dataset Consistency (CDC) metric. CLIP shows
strongest generalization (CDC: 0.92), BLIP excels on curated data, and LXMERT
leads in structured reasoning. These results expose trade-offs between
generalization and specialization, informing industrial deployment of VLMs and
guiding development toward robust, task-flexible architectures.

TL;DR: M3工具通过自然语言处理和SQL转换简化了MIMIC-IV数据库的查询，降低了技术门槛，使研究人员能更高效地获取临床数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型临床数据集（如MIMIC-IV）因技术复杂性和临床背景知识需求而难以有效利用的问题。

Method: M3通过自然语言处理将用户提问转换为SQL查询，并在本地或云端执行，返回结构化结果和原始查询以供验证。

Result: 演示显示，M3能在几分钟内完成以往需数小时手工SQL编写的复杂队列分析。

Conclusion: M3简化了临床数据的访问，加速了从原始记录到可操作见解的转化，促进了更广泛的研究社区参与。

Abstract: As ever-larger clinical datasets become available, they have the potential to
unlock unprecedented opportunities for medical research. Foremost among them is
Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), the world's largest
open-source EHR database. However, the inherent complexity of these datasets,
particularly the need for sophisticated querying skills and the need to
understand the underlying clinical settings, often presents a significant
barrier to their effective use. M3 lowers the technical barrier to
understanding and querying MIMIC-IV data. With a single command it retrieves
MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance (or hooks into the
hosted BigQuery), and-via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)-lets researchers
converse with the database in plain English. Ask a clinical question in natural
language; M3 uses a language model to translate it into SQL, executes the query
against the MIMIC-IV dataset, and returns structured results alongside the
underlying query for verifiability and reproducibility. Demonstrations show
that minutes of dialogue with M3 yield the kind of nuanced cohort analyses that
once demanded hours of handcrafted SQL and relied on understanding the
complexities of clinical workflows. By simplifying access, M3 invites the
broader research community to mine clinical critical-care data and accelerates
the translation of raw records into actionable insight.

Abstract: The judiciary, as one of democracy's three pillars, is dealing with a rising
amount of legal issues, needing careful use of judicial resources. This
research presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science
methodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta
High Court verdicts. Our framework focuses on two key aspects: first, the
creation of a robust summarization mechanism that distills complex legal texts
into concise and coherent summaries; and second, the development of an
intelligent system for retrieving similar cases, which will assist legal
professionals in research and decision making. By fine-tuning the Pegasus model
using case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the
summarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves
crucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector
database for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases
in response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries. This
technique not only improves legal research efficiency, but it also helps legal
professionals and students easily acquire and grasp key legal information,
benefiting the overall legal scenario.

Abstract: Online dating platforms have fundamentally transformed the formation of
romantic relationships, with millions of users worldwide relying on algorithmic
matching systems to find compatible partners. However, current recommendation
systems in dating applications suffer from significant algorithmic
deficiencies, including but not limited to popularity bias, filter bubble
effects, and inadequate reciprocity modeling that limit effectiveness and
introduce harmful biases. This research integrates foundational work with
recent empirical findings to deliver a detailed analysis of dating app
recommendation systems, highlighting key issues and suggesting research-backed
solutions. Through analysis of reciprocal recommendation frameworks, fairness
evaluation metrics, and industry implementations, we demonstrate that current
systems achieve modest performance with collaborative filtering reaching 25.1\%
while reciprocal methods achieve 28.7\%. Our proposed mathematical framework
addresses these limitations through enhanced similarity measures,
multi-objective optimization, and fairness-aware algorithms that maintain
competitive accuracy while improving demographic representation to reduce
algorithmic bias.

Abstract: Patient cohort retrieval is a pivotal task in medical research and clinical
practice, enabling the identification of specific patient groups from extensive
electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we address the challenge of
cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain by applying Dense Passage
Retrieval (DPR), a prominent methodology in semantic search. We propose a
systematic approach to transform an echocardiographic EHR dataset of
unstructured nature into a Query-Passage dataset, framing the problem as a
Cohort Retrieval task. Additionally, we design and implement evaluation metrics
inspired by real-world clinical scenarios to rigorously test the models across
diverse retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we present a custom-trained DPR embedding
model that demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional and
off-the-shelf SOTA methods.To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply
DPR for patient cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain, establishing a
framework that can be adapted to other medical domains.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，EIGR在效果和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EIGR框架有效解决了群组推荐中的关键挑战，为实时推荐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Group recommendation over social media streams has attracted significant
attention due to its wide applications in domains such as e-commerce,
entertainment, and online news broadcasting. By leveraging social connections
and group behaviours, group recommendation (GR) aims to provide more accurate
and engaging content to a set of users rather than individuals. Recently,
influence-aware GR has emerged as a promising direction, as it considers the
impact of social influence on group decision-making. In earlier work, we
proposed Influence-aware Group Recommendation (IGR) to solve this task.
However, this task remains challenging due to three key factors: the large and
ever-growing scale of social graphs, the inherently dynamic nature of influence
propagation within user groups, and the high computational overhead of
real-time group-item matching.
  To tackle these issues, we propose an Enhanced Influence-aware Group
Recommendation (EIGR) framework. First, we introduce a Graph Extraction-based
Sampling (GES) strategy to minimise redundancy across multiple temporal social
graphs and effectively capture the evolving dynamics of both groups and items.
Second, we design a novel DYnamic Independent Cascade (DYIC) model to predict
how influence propagates over time across social items and user groups.
Finally, we develop a two-level hash-based User Group Index (UG-Index) to
efficiently organise user groups and enable real-time recommendation
generation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework, EIGR, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Method: 采用监督对比学习（SCL）框架训练单模态和多模态嵌入模型，并设计了一个嵌入生成和视频检索系统。

Result: 离线实验显示EBR将ROC-AUC从0.85提升至0.99，PR-AUC从0.35提升至0.95；在线实验表明EBR提高了10.32%的行动率并降低了80%以上的运营成本。

Conclusion: EBR方法在性能、成本和灵活性上优于传统分类方法，适用于视频内容审核。

Abstract: Video understanding plays a fundamental role for content moderation on short
video platforms, enabling the detection of inappropriate content. While
classification remains the dominant approach for content moderation, it often
struggles in scenarios requiring rapid and cost-efficient responses, such as
trend adaptation and urgent escalations. To address this issue, we introduce an
Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) method designed to complement traditional
classification approaches. We first leverage a Supervised Contrastive Learning
(SCL) framework to train a suite of foundation embedding models, including both
single-modal and multi-modal architectures. Our models demonstrate superior
performance over established contrastive learning methods such as CLIP and
MoCo. Building on these embedding models, we design and implement the
embedding-based retrieval system that integrates embedding generation and video
retrieval to enable efficient and effective trend handling. Comprehensive
offline experiments on 25 diverse emerging trends show that EBR improves
ROC-AUC from 0.85 to 0.99 and PR-AUC from 0.35 to 0.95. Further online
experiments reveal that EBR increases action rates by 10.32% and reduces
operational costs by over 80%, while also enhancing interpretability and
flexibility compared to classification-based solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多局限于标量方程，难以识别张量关系，因此需要一种通用的数据驱动框架来解决这一问题。

Method: SITE采用宿主-质粒结构表示张量方程，结合遗传信息保留策略、维度一致性检查和张量线性回归技术。

Result: SITE在基准测试中准确恢复了目标方程，对噪声和小样本具有鲁棒性，并能从分子模拟数据中识别本构关系。

Conclusion: SITE展示了在数据驱动张量方程发现中的潜力，适用于多种流动条件。

Abstract: Recently, data-driven methods have shown great promise for discovering
governing equations from simulation or experimental data. However, most
existing approaches are limited to scalar equations, with few capable of
identifying tensor relationships. In this work, we propose a general
data-driven framework for identifying tensor equations, referred to as Symbolic
Identification of Tensor Equations (SITE). The core idea of SITE--representing
tensor equations using a host-plasmid structure--is inspired by the
multidimensional gene expression programming (M-GEP) approach. To improve the
robustness of the evolutionary process, SITE adopts a genetic information
retention strategy. Moreover, SITE introduces two key innovations beyond
conventional evolutionary algorithms. First, it incorporates a dimensional
homogeneity check to restrict the search space and eliminate physically invalid
expressions. Second, it replaces traditional linear scaling with a tensor
linear regression technique, greatly enhancing the efficiency of numerical
coefficient optimization. We validate SITE using two benchmark scenarios, where
it accurately recovers target equations from synthetic data, showing robustness
to noise and small sample sizes. Furthermore, SITE is applied to identify
constitutive relations directly from molecular simulation data, which are
generated without reliance on macroscopic constitutive models. It adapts to
both compressible and incompressible flow conditions and successfully
identifies the corresponding macroscopic forms, highlighting its potential for
data-driven discovery of tensor equation.

Motivation: 解决传统全局KL或PL条件过于严格的问题，适应更广泛的实践场景，同时应对局部KL条件带来的新挑战。

Method: 提出不精确近端梯度方法，通过近端梯度法计算极大函数的不精确梯度，处理KL结构的子问题。

Result: 证明了极大函数的局部Hölder光滑性，并在温和假设下给出了计算近似稳定点的复杂度保证。

Conclusion: 局部KL条件更灵活，但需新方法应对其复杂性；提出的算法有效且理论支持。

Abstract: We study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems in which the inner
maximization problem satisfies a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition
that may vary with the outer minimization variable. In contrast to the global
KL or Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) conditions commonly assumed in the literature
-- which are significantly stronger and often too restrictive in practice --
this local KL condition accommodates a broader range of practical scenarios.
However, it also introduces new analytical challenges. In particular, as an
optimization algorithm progresses toward a stationary point of the problem, the
region over which the KL condition holds may shrink, resulting in a more
intricate and potentially ill-conditioned landscape. To address this challenge,
we show that the associated maximal function is locally H\"older smooth.
Leveraging this key property, we develop an inexact proximal gradient method
for solving the minimax problem, where the inexact gradient of the maximal
function is computed by applying a proximal gradient method to a KL-structured
subproblem. Under mild assumptions, we establish complexity guarantees for
computing an approximate stationary point of the minimax problem.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have fundamentally transformed
numerical-based high-performance computing (HPC) applications with data-driven
approaches and endeavored to address existing challenges, e.g. high
computational intensity, in various scientific domains. In this study, we
explore the scenarios of coupling HPC and AI (HPC-AI) in the context of
emerging scientific applications, presenting a novel methodology that
incorporates three patterns of coupling: surrogate, directive, and coordinate.
Each pattern exemplifies a distinct coupling strategy, AI-driven prerequisite,
and typical HPC-AI ensembles. Through case studies in materials science, we
demonstrate the application and effectiveness of these patterns. The study
highlights technical challenges, performance improvements, and implementation
details, providing insight into promising perspectives of HPC-AI coupling. The
proposed coupling patterns are applicable not only to materials science but
also to other scientific domains, offering valuable guidance for future HPC-AI
ensembles in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Deep neural networks generate and process large volumes of data, posing
challenges for low-resource embedded systems. In-memory computing has been
demonstrated as an efficient computing infrastructure and shows promise for
embedded AI applications. Among newly-researched memory technologies, racetrack
memory is a non-volatile technology that allows high data density fabrication,
making it a good fit for in-memory computing. However, integrating in-memory
arithmetic circuits with memory cells affects both the memory density and power
efficiency. It remains challenging to build efficient in-memory arithmetic
circuits on racetrack memory within area and energy constraints. To this end,
we present an efficient in-memory convolutional neural network (CNN)
accelerator optimized for use with racetrack memory. We design a series of
fundamental arithmetic circuits as in-memory computing cells suited for
multiply-and-accumulate operations. Moreover, we explore the design space of
racetrack memory based systems and CNN model architectures, employing co-design
to improve the efficiency and performance of performing CNN inference in
racetrack memory while maintaining model accuracy. Our designed circuits and
model-system co-optimization strategies achieve a small memory bank area with
significant improvements in energy and performance for racetrack memory based
embedded systems.

Abstract: We develop a rotation-invariant neural network that provides the global
minimum-variance portfolio by jointly learning how to lag-transform historical
returns and how to regularise both the eigenvalues and the marginal
volatilities of large equity covariance matrices. This explicit mathematical
mapping offers clear interpretability of each module's role, so the model
cannot be regarded as a pure black-box. The architecture mirrors the analytical
form of the global minimum-variance solution yet remains agnostic to dimension,
so a single model can be calibrated on panels of a few hundred stocks and
applied, without retraining, to one thousand US equities-a cross-sectional jump
that demonstrates robust out-of-sample generalisation. The loss function is the
future realized minimum portfolio variance and is optimized end-to-end on real
daily returns. In out-of-sample tests from January 2000 to December 2024 the
estimator delivers systematically lower realised volatility, smaller maximum
drawdowns, and higher Sharpe ratios than the best analytical competitors,
including state-of-the-art non-linear shrinkage. Furthermore, although the
model is trained end-to-end to produce an unconstrained (long-short)
minimum-variance portfolio, we show that its learned covariance representation
can be used in general optimizers under long-only constraints with virtually no
loss in its performance advantage over competing estimators. These gains
persist when the strategy is executed under a highly realistic implementation
framework that models market orders at the auctions, empirical slippage,
exchange fees, and financing charges for leverage, and they remain stable
during episodes of acute market stress.

We introduce MENASpeechBank, a reference speech bank comprising about 18K high-quality utterances from 124 speakers spanning multiple MENA countries, covering English, Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and regional Arabic varieties. Building on this resource, we develop a controllable synthetic data pipeline that: (i) constructs persona profiles enriched with World Values Survey-inspired attributes, (ii) defines a taxonomy of about 5K conversational scenarios, (iii) matches personas to scenarios via semantic similarity, (iv) generates about 417K role-play conversations with an LLM where the user speaks as the persona and the assistant behaves as a helpful agent, and (v) synthesizes the user turns by conditioning on reference speaker audio to preserve speaker identity and diversity. We evaluate both synthetic and human-recorded conversations and provide detailed analysis. We will release MENASpeechBank and the generated conversations publicly for the community."}

Recent studies show that sparse subsets of attention heads within an LALM can serve as strong discriminative feature extractors for downstream tasks such as classification via simple voting schemes. However, these methods assign uniform weights to all selected heads, implicitly assuming that each head contributes equally across all semantic categories. In this work, we propose Class-Conditional Sparse Attention Vectors for Large Audio-Language Models, a few-shot classification method that learns class-dependent importance weights over attention heads. This formulation allows individual heads to specialize in distinct semantic categories and to contribute to ensemble predictions proportionally to their estimated reliability. Experiments on multiple few-shot audio and audiovisual classification benchmarks and tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art uniform voting-based approaches by up to 14.52%, 1.53%, 8.35% absolute gains for audio classification, audio-visual classification, and spoofing detection respectively."}

ROBOT", "summary": "Driven by breakthroughs in next-generation artificial intelligence, embodied intelligence is rapidly advancing into industrial manufacturing. In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing."}

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++. Our findings serve as a warning for future multimodal variants, as text tokenizers remain a significant barrier to equitable models."}

By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

These properties create two practical tensions. First, dense FFNs spend the same compute on every token regardless of context, and they allocate capacity uniformly even when language exhibits highly clustered context structure. Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline."}

The proposed framework bridges the gap between federated learning and multi-modal prompt-tuning which have traditionally focused on either uni-modal or centralized data. A key challenge in this setting arises from the lack of semantic alignment between prompt instructions that encode similar distributional patterns of missing data across different clients. To address this, our framework introduces specialized client-tuning and server-aggregation designs that simultaneously optimize, align, and aggregate prompt-tuning instructions across clients and data modalities. This allows prompt instructions to complement one another and be combined effectively. Extensive evaluations on diverse multimodal benchmark datasets demonstrate that our work consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines."}

Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks.

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

We introduce KANLoc, a monocular localization framework that tightly couples VO with a lightweight but robust absolute pose regressor. At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion. On both realistic synthetic and real lunar landing datasets, KANLoc reduces average translation and rotation error by 32% and 45%, respectively, with per-trajectory gains of up to 45%/48%, outperforming strong baselines."}

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment.

We present T2VTree, a user-centered visual analytics approach for agent-assisted thought-to-video authoring. T2VTree represents the authoring process as a tree visualization. Each node in the tree binds an editable specification (intent, referenced inputs, workflow choice, prompts, and parameters) with the resulting multimodal outputs, making refinement, branching, and provenance inspection directly operable. To reduce the burden of deciding what to do next, a set of collaborating agents translates step-level intent into an executable plan that remains visible and user-editable before execution. We further implement a visual analytics system that integrates branching authoring with in-place preview and stitching for convergent assembly, enabling end-to-end multi-scene creation without leaving the authoring context. We demonstrate T2VTreeVA through two multi-scene case studies and a comparative user study, showing how the T2VTree visualization and editable agent planning support reliable refinement, localized comparison, and practical reuse in real authoring workflows.

Generative AI has shown promise in increasing data volume and enhancing model training, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) domains. However, generating physiological time-series data, a common type in medical AI applications, presents unique challenges due to its inherent complexity and variability. This paper introduces TransConv-DDPM, an enhanced generative AI method for biomechanical and physiological time-series data generation. The model employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with U-Net, multi-scale convolution modules, and a transformer layer to capture both global and local temporal dependencies. We evaluated TransConv-DDPM on three diverse datasets, generating both long and short-sequence time-series data. Quantitative comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, TimeGAN and Diffusion-TS, using four performance metrics, demonstrated promising results, particularly on the SmartFallMM and EEG datasets, where it effectively captured the more gradual temporal change patterns between data points. Additionally, a utility test on the SmartFallMM dataset revealed that adding synthetic fall data generated by TransConv-DDPM improved predictive model performance, showing a 13.64% improvement in F1-score and a 14.93% increase in overall accuracy compared to the baseline model trained solely on fall data from the SmartFallMM dataset.

The most dominant approach to multi-agent cooperation is the utilitarian welfare which can produce efficient highly inequitable outcomes. This paper proposes a novel framework to foster fairer cooperation by replacing the standard utilitarian objective with Proportional Fairness. We introduce a fair altruistic utility for each agent, defined on the individual log-payoff space and derive the analytical conditions required to ensure cooperation in classic social dilemmas.

Recently, researchers have explored using audio-text joint embeddings, allowing users to enroll phrases with text, and proposed techniques to disambiguate similar utterances. We find that existing OV-KWS solutions often overly bias the beginning phonemes of an enrollment, causing false triggers when negative enrollment-query-pairs share a prefix (``turn the volume up'' vs. ``turn the volume down''). We trace this to two factors: training data bias and position-biased cross-modal scoring. To address these limitations, we introduce the Partial Overlap Benchmark (POB) with two datasets, POB-Spark and POB-LibriPhrase (POB-LP), containing mismatched audio-text pairs with shared prefixes, and propose Equal-weighting Position Scoring (EPS), a lightweight decision layer. Using EPS alone reduces EER on POB-Spark from 64.4\\% to 29.3\\% and improves POB-LP accuracy from 87.6\\% to 96.8\\%, while maintaining performance on LibriPhrase and Google Speech Commands (GSC).

In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness.

While multimodal foundation models excel at passive perception, their capacity for active, self-directed exploration remains understudied. We propose Theory of Space, defined as an agent's ability to actively acquire information through self-directed, active exploration and to construct, revise, and exploit a spatial belief from sequential, partial observations. We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various VLMs demonstrate that CR-VLM achieves effective, efficient, and robust configurable refusals, offering a scalable path toward user-adaptive safety alignment in VLMs."}

Project page: https://avere-iclr.github.io", "summary": "Emotion understanding is essential for building socially intelligent agents. Although recent multimodal large language models have shown strong performance on this task, two key challenges remain - spurious associations between emotions and irrelevant audiovisual cues, and hallucinations of audiovisual cues driven by text priors in the language model backbone. To quantify and understand these issues, we introduce EmoReAlM, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs for cue-emotion associations, hallucinations and modality agreement. We then propose AVEm-DPO, a preference optimization technique that aligns model responses with both audiovisual inputs and emotion-centric queries. Specifically, we construct preferences over responses exhibiting spurious associations or hallucinations, and audiovisual input pairs guided by textual prompts. We also include a regularization term that penalizes reliance on text priors, thereby mitigating modality-specific cue hallucinations. Experimental results on DFEW, RAVDESS and EMER demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of the reference baseline models with 6-19% of relative performance gains in zero-shot settings. By providing both a rigorous benchmark and a robust optimization framework, this work enables principled evaluation and improvement of MLLMs for emotion understanding and social AI. Code, models and benchmark will be released at https://avere-iclr.github.io."}

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

EvoCorps frames discourse governance as a dynamic social game and coordinates roles for monitoring, planning, grounded generation, and multi-identity diffusion. A retrieval-augmented collective cognition core provides factual grounding and action--outcome memory, while closed-loop evolutionary learning adapts strategies as the environment and attackers change.

We address these gaps through three contributions: (1) a systematic comparison between text-based models with acoustic features, a novel audio-only architecture (AudioSeg) operating on learned audio representations, and multimodal LLMs; (2) empirical analysis of factors affecting performance, including transcript quality, acoustic features, duration, and speaker composition; and (3) formalized evaluation protocols contrasting transcript-dependent text-space protocols with transcript-invariant time-space protocols. Our experiments on YTSeg reveal that AudioSeg substantially outperforms text-based approaches, pauses provide the largest acoustic gains, and MLLMs remain limited by context length and weak instruction following, yet MLLMs are promising on shorter audio."}

In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce Vectra, to the best of our knowledge, the first reference-free, MLLM-driven visual quality assessment framework for e-commerce IIMT. Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning.

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process. Most remarkably, 100% of samples exhibit simultaneous emergence across all spatial regions, ruling out sequential path construction and providing evidence for holistic rather than algorithmic reasoning.

ValueFlow introduces a 56-value evaluation dataset derived from the Schwartz Value Survey and quantifies agents' value orientations during interaction using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. Building on this measurement layer, ValueFlow decomposes value drift into agent-level response behavior and system-level structural effects, operationalized by two metrics: beta-susceptibility, which measures an agent's sensitivity to perturbed peer signals, and system susceptibility (SS), which captures how node-level perturbations affect final system outputs. Experiments across multiple model backbones, prompt personas, value dimensions, and network structures show that susceptibility varies widely across values and is strongly shaped by structural topology."}

This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments."}

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

Yet, regularization requires additional hyperparameters, which must be carefully tuned--a challenging task when the payoff structure is known, and considerably harder when the structure is unknown or subject to change. Motivated by this problem, we repurpose a classical model in evolutionary game theory, i.e., the Brown-von Neumann-Nash (BNN) dynamics, by leveraging the intrinsic convergence of this dynamics in zero-sum games without regularization, and provide last-iterate convergence guarantees in noisy normal-form games (NFGs). Importantly, to make this approach more applicable, we develop a novel framework with theoretical guarantees that integrates the BNN dynamics in extensive-form games (EFGs) through counterfactual weighting.

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation."}

To address the resulting semantic-geometric discrepancy and mitigate the memory consumption, we further design a multi-criteria map management strategy that prunes redundant or inconsistent Gaussians while preserving scene integrity. Finally, a hybrid field optimization framework jointly refines the geometric and semantic fields under real-time constraints by decoupling their optimization frequencies according to field characteristics. The proposed system achieves superior geometric fidelity compared to geometric-only baselines and comparable semantic fidelity to offline approaches while operating at 15 FPS. Our results demonstrate that online SLAM with dense, uncompressed language-aligned feature fields is both feasible and effective, bridging the gap between 3D perception and language-based reasoning."}

We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference. We also discuss the implications for AI leadership and capability diffusion."}

Motivated by the observation that stable personality traits shape everyday preferences, we study personality as a principled ''latent'' signal behind preference statements. Through extensive experiments, we find that conditioning on personality-aligned preferences substantially improves personalized question answering: selecting preferences consistent with a user's inferred personality increases answer-choice accuracy from 29.25% to 76%, compared to using randomly selected preferences. Based on these findings, we introduce PACIFIC (Preference Alignment Choices Inference for Five-factor Identity Characterization), a personality-labeled preference dataset containing 1200 preference statements spanning diverse domains (e.g., travel, movies, education), annotated with Big-Five (OCEAN) trait directions.

The Image Matching Challenge 2025 (IMC2025) highlights these difficulties by requiring both scene discovery and camera pose estimation under real-world conditions, including outliers and mixed content. This paper investigates the application of Gaussian-constrained representations inspired by LeJEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture) to address these challenges. We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines."}

We argue that this formulation is inefficient and lacks the structural inductive bias necessary for distinguishing between local feature preservation and global context integration. To address this, we introduce the Hybrid Dual-Path Linear (HDPL) operator, which decomposes the affine transformation into two topologically distinct pathways: a sparse block-diagonal component for high-rank local processing, and a low-rank Variational Autoencoder (VAE) bottleneck for global context regularization. By \"surgically\" replacing specific projections (Query, Key, Value, Gate, Up) with HDPL operators while retaining standard dense layers for aggregation (Output, Down), we achieve a superior balance of efficiency and representational power. Experiments on the FineWeb-Edu dataset demonstrate that the HDPL architecture outperforms a standard Llama-style baseline, reducing validation loss while simultaneously reducing parameter count by 6.8%. Beyond immediate performance gains, we discuss how the explicit materialization of a probabilistic latent space within the Transformer backbone serves as a vital architectural affordance, offering new pathways for inference-time or hypernetwork induced control, continual adaptation, interpretability, and cross-model or cross-modal synchronization.

Although recent face restoration techniques applied to surveillance cameras can significantly enhance visual quality, they often compromise fidelity (i.e., identity-preserving features), which directly conflicts with the primary objective of surveillance images -- reliable identity verification. Existing facial image quality assessment (FIQA) predominantly focus on either visual quality or recognition-oriented evaluation, thereby failing to jointly address visual quality and fidelity, which are critical for surveillance applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the first comprehensive study on surveillance facial image quality assessment (SFIQA), targeting the unique challenges inherent to surveillance scenarios. Specifically, we first construct SFIQA-Bench, a multi-dimensional quality assessment benchmark for surveillance facial images, which consists of 5,004 surveillance facial images captured by three widely deployed surveillance cameras in real-world scenarios. A subjective experiment is conducted to collect six dimensional quality ratings, including noise, sharpness, colorfulness, contrast, fidelity and overall quality, covering the key aspects of SFIQA. Furthermore, we propose SFIQA-Assessor, a lightweight multi-task FIQA model that jointly exploits complementary facial views through cross-view feature interaction, and employs learnable task tokens to guide the unified regression of multiple quality dimensions.

Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP)."}

We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications.

Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models.

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead.

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration."}

Existing safety frameworks largely treat alignment as a static optimization problem (e.g., tuning models to desired behavior) while overlooking the dynamic, adversarial incentives that shape how data are collected, how models are evaluated, and how they are ultimately deployed. We propose a new perspective on AI safety grounded in Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs): a class of game-theoretic models designed for adversarial resource allocation under uncertainty. By viewing AI oversight as a strategic interaction between defenders (auditors, evaluators, and deployers) and attackers (malicious actors, misaligned contributors, or worst-case failure modes), SSGs provide a unifying framework for reasoning about incentive design, limited oversight capacity, and adversarial uncertainty across the AI lifecycle. We illustrate how this framework can inform (1) training-time auditing against data/feedback poisoning, (2) pre-deployment evaluation under constrained reviewer resources, and (3) robust multi-model deployment in adversarial environments. This synthesis bridges algorithmic alignment and institutional oversight design, highlighting how game-theoretic deterrence can make AI oversight proactive, risk-aware, and resilient to manipulation."}

To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds."}

Despite significant advances in deep learning based registration methods, accurately aligning images with large deformations while preserving anatomical plausibility remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention-Driven Framework for Non-Rigid Medical Image Registration (AD-RegNet) that employs attention mechanisms to guide the registration process. Our approach combines a 3D UNet backbone with bidirectional cross-attention, which establishes correspondences between moving and fixed images at multiple scales. We introduce a regional adaptive attention mechanism that focuses on anatomically relevant structures, along with a multi-resolution deformation field synthesis approach for accurate alignment. The method is evaluated on two distinct datasets: DIRLab for thoracic 4D CT scans and IXI for brain MRI scans, demonstrating its versatility across different anatomical structures and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods on the IXI and DIRLab datasets. The proposed method maintains a favorable balance between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for clinical applications. A comprehensive evaluation using normalized cross-correlation (NCC), mean squared error (MSE), structural similarity (SSIM), Jacobian determinant, and target registration error (TRE) indicates that attention-guided registration improves alignment accuracy while ensuring anatomically plausible deformations."}

However, existing forecasting systems often fail during high-impact periods such as flash sales, holiday campaigns, and sudden policy interventions, where demand patterns shift abruptly and unpredictably. In this paper, we introduce EventCast, a modular forecasting framework that integrates future event knowledge into time-series prediction. Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods. EventCast has deployed into real-world industrial pipelines since March 2025, offering a practical solution for improving operational decision-making in dynamic e-commerce environments."}

We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications.

To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis.

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months."}

We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue).

This creates a distributional mismatch, leaving student models ill-equipped to recover from their own runtime failures. To bridge these gaps, we introduce TermiGen, an end-to-end pipeline for synthesizing verifiable environments and resilient expert trajectories. Termi-Gen first generates functionally valid tasks and Docker containers via an iterative multi-agent refinement loop.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs."}

Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music. MOVA employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, with a total of 32B parameters, of which 18B are active during inference. It supports IT2VA (Image-Text to Video-Audio) generation task. By releasing the model weights and code, we aim to advance research and foster a vibrant community of creators. The released codebase features comprehensive support for efficient inference, LoRA fine-tuning, and prompt enhancement."}

The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting."}

However, most existing steering methods rely on a single static direction per task or concept, making them inflexible under task variation and inadequate for complex tasks that require multiple coordinated capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs."}

Despite recent progress in retrieval-augmented and graph-based QA methods, systematic evaluation in this setting remains limited, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese, due to the lack of benchmark datasets that explicitly support multihop reasoning over healthcare regulations. In this work, we introduce the Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations-Multihop Reasoning Dataset (ViHERMES), a benchmark designed for multihop QA over Vietnamese healthcare regulatory documents. ViHERMES consists of high-quality question-answer pairs that require reasoning across multiple regulations and capture diverse dependency patterns, including amendment tracing, cross-document comparison, and procedural synthesis. To construct the dataset, we propose a controlled multihop QA generation pipeline based on semantic clustering and graph-inspired data mining, followed by large language model-based generation with structured evidence and reasoning annotations. We further present a graph-aware retrieval framework that models formal legal relations at the level of legal units and supports principled context expansion for legally valid and coherent answers. Experimental results demonstrate that ViHERMES provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating multihop regulatory QA systems and that the proposed graph-aware approach consistently outperforms strong retrieval-based baselines.

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to improve robustness using only unlabeled test samples, yet most prompt-based TTA methods rely on entropy minimization -- an approach that can amplify spurious correlations and induce overconfident errors when classes share visual features. We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks."}

Many modern learning models, however -- including fixed-architecture neural networks equipped with non-quadratic norms -- naturally give rise to non-Hilbertian geometries that fall outside this setting. In Banach spaces, continuity of point-evaluation functionals alone is insufficient to guarantee feature representations or kernel-based learning formulations. In this work, we develop a functional-analytic framework for learning in Banach spaces based on the notion of featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces. We identify the precise structural conditions under which feature maps, kernel constructions, and representer-type results can be recovered beyond the Hilbertian regime. Within this framework, supervised learning is formulated as a minimal-norm interpolation or regularization problem, and existence results together with conditional representer theorems are established. We further extend the theory to vector-valued featured reproducing kernel Banach spaces and show that fixed-architecture neural networks naturally induce special instances of such spaces. This provides a unified function-space perspective on kernel methods and neural networks and clarifies when kernel-based learning principles extend beyond reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces."}

By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes. We show that this adaptive approach provides a more realistic and scalable assessment of agent robustness in the face of evolving threats.

The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach. We provide extensive simulation analysis investigating the locomotion speed, mechanical cost of transport, and basin of attraction of the proposed model."}

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time."}

Motivated by this, we present LINCSQA, a novel benchmark for predicting target gene regulation under complex chemical perturbations in bulk-cell environments. We further propose PBio-Agent, a multi-agent framework that integrates difficulty-aware task sequencing with iterative knowledge refinement. Our key insight is that genes affected by the same perturbation share causal structure, allowing confidently predicted genes to contextualize more challenging cases. The framework employs specialized agents enriched with biological knowledge graphs, while a synthesis agent integrates outputs and specialized judges ensure logical coherence. PBio-Agent outperforms existing baselines on both LINCSQA and PerturbQA, enabling even smaller models to predict and explain complex biological processes without additional training."}

This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2° in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map."}

In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods.

Demo-SafetyBench addresses this gap by modeling demographic pluralism directly at the prompt level, decoupling value framing from responses. In Stage I, prompts from DICES are reclassified into 14 safety domains (adapted from BEAVERTAILS) using Mistral 7B-Instruct-v0.3, retaining demographic metadata and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based deduplication, yielding 43,050 samples. In Stage II, pluralistic sensitivity is evaluated using LLMs-as-Raters-Gemma-7B, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-2-7B-under zero-shot inference.

Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals.

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable. Designed as an early-stage assistive tool, OMNI-Dent helps users identify potential abnormalities and determine when professional evaluation may be needed, offering a practical option for individuals with limited access to in-person care."}

Most papers report a pass@1 score computed from a single run per task, assuming this gives a reliable performance estimate. We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope. While these practices increase evaluation cost, they are essential for distinguishing genuine scientific progress from statistical noise."}

This paper presents a breakthrough by demonstrating that leader-following exponential consensus is achievable for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. The degree of instability can be explicitly characterized by two key quantities that arise from the jointly connected condition on a switching graph. By exploiting duality, we further show that the output-based distributed observer design problem for a general leader system is solvable over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable.

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

In this work, we propose the Wide and Deep research agent, a framework designed to investigate the behavior and performance of agents when scaling not only depth but also width via parallel tool calling. Unlike existing approaches that rely on complex multi-agent orchestration to parallelize workloads, our method leverages intrinsic parallel tool calling to facilitate effective coordination within a single reasoning step. We demonstrate that scaling width significantly improves performance on deep research benchmarks while reducing the number of turns required to obtain correct answers. Furthermore, we analyze the factors driving these improvements through case studies and explore various tool call schedulers to optimize parallel tool calling strategy. Our findings suggest that optimizing the trade-off between width and depth is a critical pathway toward high-efficiency deep research agents.

We term this failure mode Axis Collapse, marked by (1) disjoint feature spaces causing catastrophic forgetting, and (2) unreliable inference from misrouted experts. To resolve this, we propose AlignX, a two-stage framework. Stage 1 uses prompt-injected fine-tuning to extract axis-specific task features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Stage 2 deploys a MoCaE module that calibrates expert routing using fractal and natural geometry, improving inference reliability. AlignX achieves significant gains on Alpaca (Helpfulness), BeaverTails (Harmlessness), and TruthfulQA (Honesty), with +171.5% win rate, +110.1% in truthfulness-informativeness, and 4.3% fewer safety violations.

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant. COMBOOD scales linearly with the size of the embedding space, making it ideal for many real-life applications."}

The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings.

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling. Project site: https://lorenzo-0-0.github.io/A2A_Flow_Matching."}

By using model responses as a fitness signal, the framework iteratively compounds effective attack strategies while simultaneously ensuring \"benign-use correctness\", preventing the degenerate security of blanket refusal. Our experiments on Gemini 2.5 Flash demonstrate that evolutionary mutation systematically amplifies vulnerabilities missed by one-shot methods, with controlled ablations revealing that the synergy between exploration and targeted mutation uncovers high-severity failure modes.

Inspired by their design, we have proposed for the first time ICL using transformer models applicable to motor feedforward control, a critical task where classical PI and physics-based methods struggle with nonlinearities and complex load conditions. We propose a transformer based model architecture that separates signal representation from system behavior, enabling both few-shot finetuning and one-shot ICL. Pretrained on a large corpus of synthetic linear and nonlinear systems, the model learns to generalize to unseen system dynamics of real-world motors only with a handful of examples. In experiments, our approach generalizes across multiple motor load configurations, transforms untuned examples into accurate feedforward predictions, and outperforms PI controllers and physics-based feedforward baselines. These results demonstrate that ICL can bridge synthetic pretraining and real-world adaptability, opening new directions for data efficient control of physical systems."}

Cross-national empirical data being relatively sparse and heavily confounded, we use computational methods: an agent-based Monte Carlo simulation. We model voter behavior over multiple electoral cycles, building upon the classic spatial model, but incorporating other known voter behavior patterns, such as the bandwagon effect, strategic voting, preference updating, retrospective voting, and the thermostatic effect.

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception. Across diverse environments with complex static structure and high-speed dynamic obstacles, UEREBot achieves higher avoidance success and more stable locomotion while maintaining goal progress than representative baselines, demonstrating improved safety--progress trade-offs."}

We ask a concrete question: when the generation paradigm is changed but the agent framework and supervision are held fixed, do diffusion backbones induce systematically different planning and tool-use behaviors, and do these differences translate into end-to-end efficiency gains? We study this in a controlled setting by instantiating DLLM and AR backbones within the same agent workflow (DeepDiver) and performing matched agent-oriented fine-tuning on the same trajectory data, yielding diffusion-backed DLLM Agents and directly comparable AR agents. Across benchmarks and case studies, we find that, at comparable accuracy, DLLM Agents are on average over 30% faster end to end than AR agents, with some cases exceeding 8x speedup. Conditioned on correct task completion, DLLM Agents also require fewer interaction rounds and tool invocations, consistent with higher planner hit rates that converge earlier to a correct action path with less backtracking. We further identify two practical considerations for deploying diffusion backbones in tool-using agents. First, naive DLLM policies are more prone to structured tool-call failures, necessitating stronger tool-call-specific training to emit valid schemas and arguments. Second, for multi-turn inputs interleaving context and action spans, diffusion-style span corruption requires aligned attention masking to avoid spurious context-action information flow; without such alignment, performance degrades.

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy."}

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use."}

This lack of distributional diversity severely restricts the exploration efficiency required for subsequent RL. While recent studies have attempted to improve SFT by replacing the CE loss, aiming to preserve diversity or refine the update policy, they fail to adequately balance diversity and accuracy, thereby yielding suboptimal performance after RL. To address the mode collapse problem, we propose SED-SFT, which adaptively encourages diversity based on the token exploration space. This framework introduces a selective entropy regularization term with a selective masking mechanism into the optimization objective. Extensive experiments across eight mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that SED-SFT significantly enhances generation diversity with a negligible computational overhead increase compared with CE loss, yielding average improvements of 2.06 and 1.20 points in subsequent RL performance over standard CE-based baselines on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, respectively.

ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles."}

Despite their growing adoption, systematic evaluations of their performance across the full offline-online pipeline remain limited. This work presents a comprehensive comparative assessment of DMNs with respect to prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, and training robustness. We investigate the effects of offline training choices, including initialization, batch size, training data size, and activation regularization on online generalization performance and uncertainty. The results demonstrate that both prediction error and variance decrease with increasing training data size, while initialization and batch size can significantly influence model performance. Moreover, activation regularization is shown to play a critical role in controlling network complexity and therefore generalization performance. Compared with the original DMN, the rotation-free Interaction-based Material Network (IMN) formulation achieves a 3.4x - 4.7x speed-up in offline training, while maintaining comparable online prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

We present T2VTree, a user-centered visual analytics approach for agent-assisted thought-to-video authoring. T2VTree represents the authoring process as a tree visualization. Each node in the tree binds an editable specification (intent, referenced inputs, workflow choice, prompts, and parameters) with the resulting multimodal outputs, making refinement, branching, and provenance inspection directly operable. To reduce the burden of deciding what to do next, a set of collaborating agents translates step-level intent into an executable plan that remains visible and user-editable before execution. We further implement a visual analytics system that integrates branching authoring with in-place preview and stitching for convergent assembly, enabling end-to-end multi-scene creation without leaving the authoring context. We demonstrate T2VTreeVA through two multi-scene case studies and a comparative user study, showing how the T2VTree visualization and editable agent planning support reliable refinement, localized comparison, and practical reuse in real authoring workflows.

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning."}

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

We propose proportional rules for cardinal ballots, where each voter assigns a numerical value to each candidate corresponding to her utility if that candidate is selected. In developing these rules, we also introduce methods that produce proportional rankings, ensuring that every prefix of the ranking satisfies proportionality."}

But how robust are these reasoning traces to disruptions that occur within them? To address this question, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that perturbs a model's own CoT at fixed timesteps. We design seven interventions (benign, neutral, and adversarial) and apply them to multiple open-weight RLLMs across Math, Science, and Logic tasks. Our results show that RLLMs are generally robust, reliably recovering from diverse perturbations, with robustness improving with model size and degrading when interventions occur early. However, robustness is not style-invariant: paraphrasing suppresses doubt-like expressions and reduces performance, while other interventions trigger doubt and support recovery. Recovery also carries a cost: neutral and adversarial noise can inflate CoT length by more than 200%, whereas paraphrasing shortens traces but harms accuracy. These findings provide new evidence on how RLLMs maintain reasoning integrity, identify doubt as a central recovery mechanism, and highlight trade-offs between robustness and efficiency that future training methods should address."}

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines.

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application. It demonstrates the potential of the function offloading framework to guarantee the QoS for trajectory planning while improving the computational efficiency of the CAVs.

This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

However, many verification and synthesis problems for POMDPs are undecidable or intractable. Most prominently, the seminal result of Madani et al. (2003) states that there is no algorithm that, given a POMDP and a set of target states, can compute the maximal probability of reaching the target states, or even approximate it up to a non-trivial constant. This is in stark contrast to fully observable Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the reachability value can be computed in polynomial time.\n  In this work, we introduce posterior-deterministic POMDPs, a novel class of POMDPs. Our main technical contribution is to show that for posterior-deterministic POMDPs, the maximal probability of reaching a given set of states can be approximated up to arbitrary precision.\n  A POMDP is posterior-deterministic if the next state can be uniquely determined by the current state, the action taken, and the observation received. While the actual state is generally uncertain in POMDPs, the posterior-deterministic property tells us that once the true state is known it remains known forever. This simple and natural definition includes all MDPs and captures classical non-trivial examples such as the Tiger POMDP (Kaelbling et al. 1998), making it one of the largest known classes of POMDPs for which the reachability value can be approximated."}

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn)."}

Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01°$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results.

In this setting, Tian et al. (2021) show that achieving no-external-regret is impossible without incurring an exponential dependence on the episode length $H$. They then turn to the weaker notion of Nash-value regret and propose a V-learning algorithm with regret $O(K^{2/3})$ after $K$ episodes. However, their algorithm and guarantee do not adapt to the difficulty of the problem: even in the case where the opponent follows a fixed policy and thus $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret is well-known to be achievable, their result is still the worse rate $O(K^{2/3})$ on a weaker metric.\n  In this work, we fully address both limitations. First, we introduce empirical Nash-value regret, a new regret notion that is strictly stronger than Nash-value regret and naturally reduces to external regret when the opponent follows a fixed policy. Moreover, under this new metric, we propose a parameter-free algorithm that achieves an $O(\\min \\{\\sqrt{K} + (CK)^{1/3},\\sqrt{LK}\\})$ regret bound, where $C$ quantifies the variance of the opponent's policies and $L$ denotes the number of policy switches (both at most $O(K)$). Therefore, our results not only recover the two extremes -- $O(\\sqrt{K})$ external regret when the opponent is fixed and $O(K^{2/3})$ Nash-value regret in the worst case -- but also smoothly interpolate between these extremes by automatically adapting to the opponent's non-stationarity. We achieve so by first providing a new analysis of the epoch-based V-learning algorithm by Mao et al. (2022), establishing an $O(ηC + \\sqrt{K/η})$ regret bound, where $η$ is the epoch incremental factor. Next, we show how to adaptively restart this algorithm with an appropriate $η$ in response to the potential non-stationarity of the opponent, eventually achieving our final results."}

Yet, the challenge is no longer access to information but connecting it in meaningful, domain-spanning ways. In materials science, where innovation demands integrating concepts from molecular chemistry to mechanical performance, this is especially acute. Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility. This work establishes a framework combining knowledge graphs with multi-agent reasoning to expand the materials design space, showcasing several initial design candidates to demonstrate the approach."}

Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives.

The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

Generative reward models offer stronger semantic understanding and reasoning, but they are costly at inference time and difficult to align directly with human preferences. To this end, we propose Joint Reward Modeling (JRM), which jointly optimizes preference learning and language modeling on a shared vision-language backbone. This approach internalizes the semantic and reasoning capabilities of generative models into efficient discriminative representations, enabling fast and accurate evaluation.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models."}

This work explores a fundamental principle for enhancing generative models: treating retrieval as a form of dynamic in-context learning. We test an adaptive retrieval-augmented architecture where an LLM agent actively decides when to query an external knowledge base during its reasoning process. We compare this adaptive strategy against a standard Chain-of-Thought (CoT) baseline and a static retrieval approach on the GSM8K and MATH-500 benchmarks. Although our experiments show that static retrieval is inferior to CoT, the adaptive retrieval shows interesting behavior: While traces including retrieved results show slightly worse performance compared to CoT, traces that do not include retrieval actually perform better compared to CoT. This suggests that: (a) retrieval only rarely helps reasoning (we show a few counterexamples, e.g. using useful theorems) and (b) actively not using retrieval is indicative of good model performance. Furthermore, we find that the model scales its retrieval frequency with the difficulty of the problem, reinforcing that the decision to retrieve is a crucial metacognitive signal. The agent's ability to self-assess its knowledge and selectively engage with external information represents a key principle for building more robust and reliable generative models."}

We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant.

Although several AI-based approaches have been proposed to address isolated subtasks of MSP, a unified methodology for solving the entire MSP task has yet to be established. We propose MSP-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework that formulates MSP as a structured process composed of two constituent subproblems: precursor prediction (PP) and synthesis operation prediction (SOP). Our approach introduces a discrete material class as an intermediate decision variable that organizes both tasks into a chemically consistent decision chain. For OP, we further incorporate hierarchical precursor types as synthesis-relevant inductive biases and employ an explicit conditioning strategy that preserves precursor-related information in the autoregressive decoding state. Extensive experiments show that MSP-LLM consistently outperforms existing methods on both PP and SOP, as well as on the complete MSP task, demonstrating an effective and scalable framework for MSP that can accelerate real-world materials discovery."}

Prior works on LLM-based tutoring typically learn a single tutor policy and do not capture the diversity of tutoring styles. In real-world tutor-student interactions, pedagogical intent is realized through adaptive instructional strategies, with tutors varying the level of scaffolding, instructional directiveness, feedback, and affective support in response to learners' needs. These differences can all impact dialogue dynamics and student engagement. In this paper, we explore how tutor personas embedded in human tutor-student dialogues can be used to guide LLM behavior without relying on explicitly prompted instructions. We modify Bidirectional Preference Optimization (BiPO) to learn a steering vector, an activation-space direction that steers model responses towards certain tutor personas. We find that this steering vector captures tutor-specific variation across dialogue contexts, improving semantic alignment with ground-truth tutor utterances and increasing preference-based evaluations, while largely preserving lexical similarity. Analysis of the learned directional coefficients further reveals interpretable structure across tutors, corresponding to consistent differences in tutoring behavior. These results demonstrate that activation steering offers an effective and interpretable way for controlling tutor-specific variation in LLMs using signals derived directly from human dialogue data."}

The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL).

We train several attention-based TSP policies, collect their internal activations, and train probes on node/edge embeddings for two NP-hard prescriptive downstream tasks inspired by real-world logistics scenarios: node-removal sensitivity (identifying the most impactful node to remove) and edge-forbid sensitivity (identifying the most critical edge to retain). On a Euclidean TSP100-trained model, probes for both tasks are competitive with existing baselines. Ensembling probe signals with geometric features outperforms the strongest baselines: 65\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 58\\% baseline) for the best-node-removal task, and 73\\% top-1 accuracy (vs. 67\\% baseline) for the worst-edge identification task. To our knowledge, we are the first to study neural TSP solvers as transferable encoders for prescriptive what-if decision-support objectives beyond tour construction.

The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time."}

Yet it remains unclear whether they reliably reason across all requirements by tracking, verifying, and maintaining multiple conditions in these questions. We study this capability under multi-constraint problems, where valid answers must satisfy several constraints simultaneously. We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison."}

Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted."}

The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation.

Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement."}

We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression.

For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution."}

However, it is severely bottlenecked by the increasing memory demands of its KV cache. Previous works have shown that self-speculative decoding with sparse attention, where tokens are drafted using a subset of the KV cache and verified in parallel with full KV cache, speeds up inference in a lossless way. However, this approach relies on standalone KV selection algorithms to select the KV entries used for drafting and overlooks that the criticality of each KV entry is inherently computed during verification. In this paper, we propose SpecAttn, a self-speculative decoding method with verification-guided sparse attention. SpecAttn identifies critical KV entries as a byproduct of verification and only loads these entries when drafting subsequent tokens. This not only improves draft token acceptance rate but also incurs low KV selection overhead, thereby improving decoding throughput. SpecAttn achieves 2.81$\\times$ higher throughput over vanilla auto-regressive decoding and 1.29$\\times$ improvement over state-of-the-art sparsity-based self-speculative decoding methods."}

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation. The leader and follower policies are jointly optimized under the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework to balance task execution and consistent cooperative behaviors. We validate CoLF in both simulation and real-robot experiments using two quadruped robots. The demonstration video is available at https://sites.google.com/view/colf/."}

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

In this paper, we present a new inference-time computing technique for on-device embodied AI, namely \\emph{MosaicThinker}, which enhances the on-device small VLM's spatial reasoning capabilities on difficult cross-frame reasoning tasks.

However, the dynamic nature of emerging AI applications, the continual introduction of new datasets, and the growing number of models claiming superior performance make efficient and reliable validation of model services increasingly challenging. This motivates the development of sample-efficient performance estimators, which aim to estimate model performance by strategically selecting instances for labeling, thereby reducing annotation cost. Yet existing evaluation approaches often fail in low-variance settings: RMSE conflates bias and variance, masking persistent bias when variance is small, while p-value based tests become hypersensitive, rejecting adequate estimators for negligible deviations. To address this, we propose a fault-tolerant evaluation framework that integrates bias and variance considerations within an adjustable tolerance level ${\\varepsilon}$, enabling the evaluation of performance estimators within practically acceptable error margins. We theoretically show that proper calibration of ${\\varepsilon}$ ensures reliable evaluation across different variance regimes, and we further propose an algorithm that automatically optimizes and selects ${\\varepsilon}$.

We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline.

However, a more practical scenario involves identifying and reasoning over relevant tables from large-scale collections to answer user queries. To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images. Our approach first retrieves candidate tables using jointly trained visual-text foundation models, then leverages MLLMs to perform fine-grained reranking of these candidates, and finally employs MLLMs to reason over the selected tables for answer generation. Through extensive experiments on a newly constructed dataset comprising 88,161 training and 9,819 testing samples across 8 benchmarks with 48,504 unique tables, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods by 7.0% in retrieval recall and 6.1% in answer accuracy, offering a practical solution for real-world table understanding tasks."}

Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly. RD-VLA provides a scalable path to test-time compute in robotics, replacing token-based reasoning with latent reasoning to achieve constant memory usage and up to 80x inference speedup over prior reasoning-based VLA models.

Some examples are advances in artificial intelligence that make machines more and more humanlike, and the introduction of decentralized technologies (e.g. blockchains), which creates new forms of (decentralized) trust. These new developments have the potential to improve the provision of products and services, as well as to contribute to individual and collective well-being. However, their adoption depends largely on trust. In order to build trustworthy systems, along with defining laws, regulations and proper governance models for new forms of trust, it is necessary to properly conceptualize trust, so that it can be understood both by humans and machines. This paper is the culmination of a long-term research program of providing a solid ontological foundation on trust, by creating reference conceptual models to support information modeling, automated reasoning, information integration and semantic interoperability tasks. To address this, a Reference Ontology of Trust (ONTrust) was developed, grounded on the Unified Foundational Ontology and specified in OntoUML, which has been applied in several initiatives, to demonstrate, for example, how it can be used for conceptual modeling and enterprise architecture design, for language evaluation and (re)design, for trust management, for requirements engineering, and for trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) in the context of affective Human-AI teaming. ONTrust formally characterizes the concept of trust and its different types, describes the different factors that can influence trust, as well as explains how risk emerges from trust relations.

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning.

Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy.

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems."}

We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities."}

To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning."}

However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily. Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic graphs."}

By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field."}

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D."}

The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches."}

To enable a systematic study of this phenomenon, we introduce MACE, a benchmark of 12,000 factual questions spanning six domains with varying numbers of correct answers. Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts.

We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection.

Jobs often differ in adapter rank, batch size, and resource allocation, and naïve batching can introduce synchronization stalls, communication overheads, and per-job slowdowns that are worse than executing independently. We introduce tLoRA, a framework that enables efficient batch training of multiple LoRA jobs. tLoRA fuses adapters that share the same base model into an elastic shared super-model, exploiting existing distributed training frameworks to derive parallelism plans that share resources effectively. At the kernel level, tLoRA employs a fused LoRA kernel that adaptively reconstructs low-rank computation tiles and schedules rank-aware nano-batches to maximize overlap between computation and communication across adapters.

In this paper, we introduce ALMA (Automated meta-Learning of Memory designs for Agentic systems), a framework that meta-learns memory designs to replace hand-engineered memory designs, therefore minimizing human effort and enabling agentic systems to be continual learners across diverse domains. Our approach employs a Meta Agent that searches over memory designs expressed as executable code in an open-ended manner, theoretically allowing the discovery of arbitrary memory designs, including database schemas as well as their retrieval and update mechanisms.

To meet these requirements, an edge server must render panoramic content, predict user head motion, and transmit a portion of the scene that is large enough to cover the user viewport while remaining within wireless bandwidth constraints. Each portion produces two feedback signals: prediction feedback, indicating whether the selected portion covers the actual viewport, and transmission feedback, indicating whether the corresponding packets are successfully delivered. Prior work models this problem as a multi-armed bandit with two-level bandit feedback, but fails to exploit the fact that prediction feedback can be retrospectively computed for all candidate portions once the user head pose is observed. As a result, prediction feedback constitutes full-information feedback rather than bandit feedback. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a two-level hybrid feedback model that combines full-information and bandit feedback, and formulate the portion selection problem as an online learning task under this setting. We derive an instance-dependent regret lower bound for the hybrid feedback model and propose AdaPort, a hybrid learning algorithm that leverages both feedback types to improve learning efficiency. We further establish an instance-dependent regret upper bound that matches the lower bound asymptotically, and demonstrate through real-world trace driven simulations that AdaPort consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods."}

Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies."}

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability."}

While many prior approaches mitigate this effect through architectural modifications or residual mechanisms, the underlying spectral cause of oversmoothing is often left implicit. We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator."}

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2."}

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI"], "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems."}

Rather than exchanging feature-dependent statistics or relying on noise injection for privacy, agents cluster their local views independently and reconcile their proposals through identifier-level consensus. Consensus is achieved via decentralized ordinal ranking to select representative medoids, progressively inducing a shared hierarchical clustering across agents. Communication is limited to sample identifiers, cluster labels, and ordinal rankings, providing privacy by design while supporting overlapping feature partitions and heterogeneous local clustering methods, and yielding an interpretable shared Cluster Fusion Hierarchy (CFH) that captures cross-view agreement at multiple resolutions.We analyze communication complexity and robustness, and experiments demonstrate competitive clustering performance in vertical federated settings."}

Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), especially their reasoning abilities unlocked through reinforcement learning (RL), have opened new opportunities for tackling tasks with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, leveraging LLM reasoning for time series remains in its infancy, hindered by the absence of carefully curated time series CoT data for training, limited data efficiency caused by underexplored data scheduling, and the lack of RL algorithms tailored for exploiting such time series CoT data. In this paper, we introduce VeriTime, a framework that tailors LLMs for time series reasoning through data synthesis, data scheduling, and RL training. First, we propose a data synthesis pipeline that constructs a TS-text multimodal dataset with process-verifiable annotations. Second, we design a data scheduling mechanism that arranges training samples according to a principled hierarchy of difficulty and task taxonomy. Third, we develop a two-stage reinforcement finetuning featuring fine-grained, multi-objective rewards that leverage verifiable process-level CoT data. Extensive experiments show that VeriTime substantially boosts LLM performance across diverse time series reasoning tasks.

To address these barriers, we introduce SynCog, a novel framework integrating controllable zero-shot multimodal data synthesis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) deduction fine-tuning. Specifically, SynCog simulates diverse virtual subjects with varying cognitive profiles to effectively alleviate clinical data scarcity. This generative paradigm enables the rapid, zero-shot expansion of clinical corpora across diverse languages, effectively bypassing data bottlenecks in low-resource settings and bolstering the diagnostic performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging this synthesized dataset, we fine-tune a foundational multimodal backbone using a CoT deduction strategy, empowering the model to explicitly articulate diagnostic thought processes rather than relying on black-box predictions. Extensive experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo benchmarks demonstrate that augmenting limited clinical data with synthetic phenotypes yields competitive diagnostic performance, achieving Macro-F1 scores of 80.67% and 78.46%, respectively, outperforming current baseline models.

While thresholding scores is Bayes-optimal in the unconstrained setting, using a single threshold generally violates statistical group fairness constraints. Under independence (statistical parity) and separation (equalized odds), such thresholding suffices when the scores already satisfy the corresponding criterion. However, this does not extend to sufficiency: even perfectly group-calibrated scores -- including true class probabilities -- violate predictive parity after thresholding. In this work, we present an exact solution for optimal binary (randomized) classification under sufficiency, assuming finite sets of group-calibrated scores. We provide a geometric characterization of the feasible pairs of positive predictive value (PPV) and false omission rate (FOR) achievable by such classifiers, and use it to derive a simple post-processing algorithm that attains the optimal classifier using only group-calibrated scores and group membership. Finally, since sufficiency and separation are generally incompatible, we identify the classifier that minimizes deviation from separation subject to sufficiency, and show that it can also be obtained by our algorithm, often achieving performance comparable to the optimum."}

Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment."}

First, we establish, both theoretically and empirically, that an over-regularized RWP training objective is optimal for noise-robust generalization. For small-magnitude noise, we find that SAM's adversarial objective further improves performance over any RWP configuration, but performs poorly for large-magnitude noise. We link the cause of this to a vanishing-gradient effect, caused by unevenness in the loss landscape, affecting both SAM and RWP. Lastly, we demonstrate that dynamically adjusting the perturbation strength to match the evolution of the loss landscape improves optimizing for these perturbed objectives."}

Automat. Lett. (RA-L) 2026", "summary": "Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/."}

To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution. This work isolates a concrete representation of general misalignment for monitoring and mitigation. More broadly, it offers a detailed case study and preliminary metrics for investigating how inductive biases shape generalisation in LLMs. We open-source all code, datasets and model finetunes."}

Instead of discarding tokens, DeltaKV encodes semantic residuals relative to retrieved historical references, preserving fidelity while substantially reducing storage. To translate compression gains into real system speedups, we further introduce Sparse-vLLM, a high-performance inference engine with decoupled memory management and kernels optimized for sparse and irregular KV layouts.

We propose ShaPO, a geometry-aware preference optimization framework that enforces worst-case alignment objectives via selective geometry control over alignment-critical parameter subspace. By avoiding uniform geometry constraints, ShaPO mitigates the over-regularization that can harm robustness under distribution shift. We instantiate ShaPO at two levels: token-level ShaPO stabilizes likelihood-based surrogate optimization, while reward-level ShaPO enforces reward-consistent optimization under noisy supervision. Across diverse safety benchmarks and noisy preference settings, ShaPO consistently improves safety robustness over popular preference optimization methods. Moreover, ShaPO composes cleanly with data-robust objectives, yielding additional gains and empirically supporting the proposed optimization-geometry perspective."}

Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

To transcend these limitations, we propose ToolSelf, a novel paradigm enabling tool-driven runtime self-reconfiguration. By abstracting configuration updates as a callable tool, ToolSelf unifies task execution and self-adjustment into a single action space, achieving a phase transition from external rules to intrinsic parameters. Agents can thereby autonomously update their sub-goals and context based on task progression, and correspondingly adapt their strategy and toolbox, transforming from passive executors into dual managers of both task and self. We further devise Configuration-Aware Two-stage Training (CAT), combining rejection sampling fine-tuning with trajectory-level reinforcement learning to internalize this meta-capability. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that ToolSelf rivals specialized workflows while generalizing to novel tasks, achieving a 24.1% average performance gain and illuminating a path toward truly self-adaptive agents."}

First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions. The resulting materials exhibit realism and diversity far exceeding the limited synthetic training data, demonstrating that material knowledge can be successfully transferred from internet-scale video models into standalone, reusable neural 3D assets."}

In such a system, we present a unified framework to address the general manipulation task problem. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks. By conducting the ablation study, it is confirmed that the proposed RL with contrastive learning overcomes policy collapse.

We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap.

Given their diverse designs, we first place representative metric-based methods within a unified framework, enabling a clear assessment of their advantages and limitations. Our analysis identifies a core challenge across these methods: the token-level detection score is easily biased by the inherent randomness of the MGTs generation process. To address this, we theoretically and empirically reveal two relationships of context detection scores that may aid calibration: Neighbor Similarity and Initial Instability. We then propose a Markov-informed score calibration strategy that models these relationships using Markov random fields, and implements it as a lightweight component via a mean-field approximation, allowing our method to be seamlessly integrated into existing detectors.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

In light of this analysis, we propose NeVA, a neuron-level editing framework for controllable value alignment in LLMs. NeVA identifies sparse, value-relevant neurons and performs inference-time activation editing, enabling fine-grained control without parameter updates or retraining. Experiments show that NeVA achieves stronger target value alignment while incurring smaller performance degradation on general capability. Moreover, NeVA significantly reduces the average leakage, with residual effects largely confined to semantically related value classes.

However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

Although some previous work tended to handle this challenge via optimization- or structure-level remedies, the overall performance of GCNs still suffers from limited accuracy, poor stability, and unaffordable computational cost. Moreover, neglect of higher-order relationships during the propagation of MPNNs has further limited the performance of them. To overcome these challenges, a novel variant of PageRank named motif-based personalized PageRank (MPPR) is proposed to measure the influence of one node to another on the basis of considering higher-order motif relationships. Secondly, the MPPR is utilized to the message passing process of GCNs, thereby guiding the message passing process at a relatively `high' level. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms almost all of the baselines on accuracy, stability, and time consumption.

We introduce TDGNet, a temporal dynamic graph framework that formulates hallucination detection as learning over evolving token-level attention graphs. At each denoising step, we sparsify the attention graph and update per-token memories via message passing, then apply temporal attention to aggregate trajectory-wide evidence for final prediction.

A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

While existing studies augment LLMs with various knowledge types, it remains unclear how effectively the additional costs translate into accuracy. In this paper, we explore how meta-cognition of LLMs, i.e., their self-awareness of their own knowledge states, can regulate the reasoning process. Specifically, we propose MedCoG, a Medical Meta-Cognition Agent with Knowledge Graph, where the meta-cognitive assessments of task complexity, familiarity, and knowledge density dynamically regulate utilization of procedural, episodic, and factual knowledge. The LLM-centric on-demand reasoning aims to mitigate scaling laws by (1) reducing costs via avoiding indiscriminate scaling, (2) improving accuracy via filtering out distractive knowledge. To validate this, we empirically characterize the scaling curve and introduce inference density to quantify inference efficiency, defined as the ratio of theoretically effective cost to actual cost. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MedCoG on five hard sets of medical benchmarks, yielding 5.5x inference density. Furthermore, the Oracle study highlights the significant potential of meta-cognitive regulation."}

Standard reasoning LLMs verbalize intermediate steps as chain-of-thought; latent reasoning transformers (LRTs) instead perform deliberation entirely in continuous hidden space. We investigate an LRT, decoding the model's evolving beliefs at every step on a multiple-choice QA benchmark. We find that the model spontaneously learns a structured search process in latent space. Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer. The search is adaptive: replacing distractors with implausible alternatives shortens exploration by 54%. Latent reasoning models achieve in activation space what chain-of-thought achieves through words: the ability to be wrong, notice, and recover."}

To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts."}

We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration."}

Concept localisation methods can facilitate selective finetuning, but existing techniques are static, resulting in suboptimal utility. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose TRUST (Targeted Robust Selective fine Tuning), a novel approach for dynamically estimating target concept neurons and unlearning them through selective finetuning, empowered by a Hessian based regularization. We show experimentally, against a number of SOTA baselines, that TRUST is robust against adversarial prompts, preserves generation quality to a significant degree, and is also significantly faster than the SOTA.

This ability, collectively known as general continual learning (GCL), encapsulates practical challenges such as online datastreams and blurry task boundaries. Although leveraging pretrained models (PTMs) has greatly advanced conventional continual learning (CL), these methods remain limited in reconciling the diverse and temporally mixed information along a single pass, resulting in sub-optimal GCL performance. Inspired by meta-plasticity and reconstructive memory in neuroscience, we introduce here an innovative approach named Meta Post-Refinement (MePo) for PTMs-based GCL. This approach constructs pseudo task sequences from pretraining data and develops a bi-level meta-learning paradigm to refine the pretrained backbone, which serves as a prolonged pretraining phase but greatly facilitates rapid adaptation of representation learning to downstream GCL tasks. MePo further initializes a meta covariance matrix as the reference geometry of pretrained representation space, enabling GCL to exploit second-order statistics for robust output alignment. MePo serves as a plug-in strategy that achieves significant performance gains across a variety of GCL benchmarks and pretrained checkpoints in a rehearsal-free manner (e.g., 15.10\\%, 13.36\\%, and 12.56\\% on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200 under Sup-21/1K).

In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary). We also conduct experiments on LLM-Judges' capability at detecting these errors, through which we demonstrate the challenging nature of our dataset, the robustness of our taxonomy, and the need for future work in this field to enhance LLMs' performance in the same.

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy.

Specifically, we utilize the fast-slow dynamics: while an alignment of first-layer weights develops rapidly, the second-layer weights develop slowly. The direction of a flow on a critical manifold, determined by the slow dynamics, decides whether feature unlearning occurs. We give numerical validation of the result, and derive theoretical grounding and scaling laws of the feature unlearning.

To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario. We then solve these subproblems in parallel and select one using the cost function from the original problem. To validate our work, we conduct simulations using different user responses to the questionnaire. We assess how effectively our planner reflects user preferences compared to preference-agnostic baseline planners by measuring preference alignment."}

In reviewing these tasks, we discuss methodological approaches, evaluation metrics, and publicly available resources, while highlighting domain-specific challenges such as data scarcity, privacy constraints, and source variability.

However, as the amount of context grows, their reliability often deteriorates, a phenomenon known as \"context rot\". Existing long-context benchmarks primarily focus on single-step settings that evaluate a model's ability to retrieve information from a long snippet. In realistic scenarios, however, LLMs often need to act as agents that explore environments, follow instructions and plans, extract useful information, and predict correct actions under a dynamically growing context. To assess language agents in such settings, we introduce LOCA-bench (a benchmark for LOng-Context Agents). Given a task prompt, LOCA-bench leverages automated and scalable control of environment states to regulate the agent's context length. This design enables LOCA-bench to extend the context length potentially to infinity in a controlled way while keeping the underlying task semantics fixed. LOCA-bench evaluates language agents as a combination of models and scaffolds, including various context management strategies. While agent performance generally degrades as the environment states grow more complex, advanced context management techniques can substantially improve the overall success rate. We open-source LOCA-bench to provide a platform for evaluating models and scaffolds in long-context, agentic scenarios: https://github.com/hkust-nlp/LOCA-bench"}

Both humans and LLMs display evidence of convention-formation (increasing the accuracy and consistency of their turns while decreasing their length) when communicating in same-type dyads (humans with humans, AI with AI). However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs. These results suggest that conversational alignment requires more than just the ability to mimic previous interactions, but also shared interpretative biases toward the meanings that are conveyed."}

Across multiple domains, EXPERIGEN consistently discovers 2-4x more statistically significant hypotheses that are 7-17 percent more predictive than prior approaches, and naturally extends to complex data regimes including multimodal and relational datasets.

To evaluate these qualities, we conduct an expert review of machine-generated hypotheses, collecting feedback from senior faculty. Among 25 reviewed hypotheses, 88 percent were rated moderately or strongly novel, 70 percent were deemed impactful and worth pursuing, and most demonstrated rigor comparable to senior graduate-level research.

Importantly, this behavior emerges naturally from one-stage pretraining on general text and reduces computation in both training and inference via token-wise adaptive halting.

It is a Bayesian nonparametric model that places a prior on the space of reward distributions, enabling it to represent a substantially broader class of reward models than classical Gaussian process (GP). The $\\infty$-GP is used in combination with Thompson Sampling (TS) to enable effective exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, we develop a new TS regret analysis framework for general rewards, which relates the regret to the total variation distance between the surrogate model and the true reward distribution. Furthermore, with a truncated Gibbs sampling procedure, our method is computationally scalable, incurring minimal additional memory and computational complexities compared to classical GP. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in settings with non-stationary, heavy-tailed, or other ill-conditioned rewards."}

To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors.

In response to this unresolved dilemma, we introduce RAPS, a reputation-aware publish-subscribe paradigm for adaptive, scalable, and robust coordination of LLM agents. RAPS is grounded in the Distributed Publish-Subscribe Protocol, allowing LLM agents to exchange messages based on their declared intents rather than predefined topologies. Beyond this substrate, RAPS further incorporates two coherent overlays: (i) Reactive Subscription, enabling agents to dynamically refine their intents; and (ii) Bayesian Reputation, empowering each agent with a local watchdog to detect and isolate malicious peers.

To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels.

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average."}

Since clinical decision-making is inherently collaborative, we challenge the monolithic scaling paradigm and ask whether a Small Agent Group (SAG) can support better clinical reasoning. SAG shifts from single-model intelligence to collective expertise by distributing reasoning, evidence-based analysis, and critical audit through a collaborative deliberation process. To assess the clinical utility of SAG, we conduct extensive evaluations using diverse clinical metrics spanning effectiveness, reliability, and deployment cost. Our results show that SAG achieves superior performance compared to a single giant model, both with and without additional optimization or retrieval-augmented generation.

Marinov and Zimmert [2021] first showed that such simultaneous optimality is impossible against an adaptive adversary. Our work takes a first step to demonstrate its possibility against an oblivious adversary when losses are deterministic. First, we extend the impossibility result of Marinov and Zimmert [2021] to the case of deterministic losses. Then, we present an algorithm achieving optimal static and dynamic regret simultaneously against an oblivious adversary. Together, they reveal a fundamental separation between adaptive and oblivious adversaries when multiple regret benchmarks are considered simultaneously. It also provides new insight into the long open problem of simultaneously achieving optimal regret against switching benchmarks of different numbers of switches.\n  Our algorithm uses negative static regret to compensate for the exploration overhead incurred when controlling dynamic regret, and leverages Blackwell approachability to jointly control both regrets.

Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear. Experiments on public benchmarks, controlled stress tests, and real-world deployments demonstrate accurate and stable tracking with KB-level priors from heterogeneous map sources, including under geometrically degenerate and sustained occlusion and in the presence of gradual scene changes."}

We adopt a convergence-guaranteed cutting-set procedure as an adversarial optimization framework, which iteratively approximates solutions that satisfy global robustness conditions. To address the nonconvex quadratic structure induced by feature dependencies, we apply piecewise McCormick relaxation to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), ensuring global optimality. Experimental results show that our method achieves strong robustness, with direct global optimization of the original formulation providing especially stable and efficient results. The proposed framework is extensible to more complex constraint settings, laying the groundwork for future advances in counterfactual reasoning under nonconvex quadratic formulations."}

In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document. LLMs are trained through reinforcement learning to reconstruct the document by correctly identifying and sequencing missing paragraphs from a set of candidate options. This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data.

To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench.

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions. Under this noise model, we establish sharp convergence rates of SignSGD and Lion for generalized smooth function classes, matching or surpassing previous best-known bounds. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to Muon and Muonlight, providing what is, to our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of matrix optimization under heavy-tailed stochasticity. These results offer a strong theoretical justification for the empirical superiority of sign-based optimizers, showcasing that they are naturally suited to handle the noisy gradients associated with heavy tails.

This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks. These subtasks require coordinating different robots from different vendors, while enforcing fine-grained access control management on the data. To evaluate our methodology, we created the SkillChain-RTD benchmark made it publicly available.

We attribute this to a fundamental architectural flaw: standard LLMs operate as \"malloc-only\" engines, continuously accumulating valid and redundant steps alike without a mechanism to prune obsolete information. To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%.

While prior work observed that convexity and efficiency co-occur in color naming, the analytical relation between them and why they co-occur have not been well understood. We address this gap by combining analytical and empirical analyses that build on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for semantic efficiency. First, we show that convexity and efficiency are distinct in the sense that neither entails the other: there are convex systems which are inefficient, and optimally-efficient systems that are non-convex. Crucially, however, the IB-optimal systems are mostly convex in the domain of color naming, explaining the main empirical basis for the convexity approach. Second, we show that efficiency is a stronger predictor for discriminating attested color naming systems from hypothetical variants, with convexity adding negligible improvement on top of that. Finally, we discuss a range of empirical phenomena that convexity cannot account for but efficiency can. Taken together, our work suggests that while convexity and efficiency can yield similar structural observations, they are fundamentally distinct, with efficiency providing a more comprehensive account of semantic typology."}

Although several public waste classification datasets exist, they remain fragmented, inconsistent, and biased toward specific environments. Differences in class names, annotation formats, image conditions, and class distributions make it difficult to combine these datasets or train models that generalize well to real world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce the GlobalWasteData (GWD) archive, a large scale dataset of 89,807 images across 14 main categories, annotated with 68 distinct subclasses. We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Brep2Shape, a novel self-supervised pre-training method designed to align abstract boundary representations with intuitive shape representations. Our method employs a geometry-aware task where the model learns to predict dense spatial points from parametric Bézier control points, enabling the network to better understand physical manifolds derived from abstract coefficients. To enhance this alignment, we propose a Dual Transformer backbone with parallel streams that independently encode surface and curve tokens to capture their distinct geometric properties. Moreover, the topology attention is integrated to model the interdependencies between surfaces and curves, thereby maintaining topological consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Brep2Shape offers significant scalability, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and faster convergence across various downstream tasks."}

Our findings reveal that representativity-based acquisition functions effectively explore the dataset but do not prioritize boundary decisions, whereas uncertainty-based acquisition functions focus on refining boundary decisions already identified by the neural network. This trade-off is known as the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To address this dilemma, we introduce six aggregation structures: series, parallel, hybrid, adaptive feedback, random exploration, and annealing exploration. Our aggregated acquisition functions alleviate common AL pathologies such as batch mode inefficiency and the cold start problem. Additionally, we focus on balancing accuracy and energy consumption, contributing to the development of more sustainable, energy-aware artificial intelligence (AI).

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data. PAR is compatible with multiple BC regularization paradigms. Extensive experiments across offline RL benchmarks show that PAR consistently improves performance and approaches state-of-the-art when combined with the basic TD3+BC."}

We prove that under Dogma 4, standard RL agents suffer from what we call Objective Decoupling, a structural failure mode where the agent's learned objective permanently separates from the latent ground truth, guaranteeing convergence to misalignment. To resolve this, we propose Epistemic Source Alignment (ESA). Unlike standard robust methods that rely on statistical consensus (trusting the majority), ESA utilizes sparse safety axioms to judge the source of the feedback rather than the signal itself.

A Probabilistic Perspective on the Emergence of Reasoning in RLVR", "categories": ["cs.CL"], "comment": "15 pages", "summary": "Whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) endows Large Language Models (LLMs) with new capabilities or merely elicits latent traces remains a central debate. In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($ρ\\in [0.69, 0.96]$); and (3) RLVR, acting as a global optimizer, can cause specific skills to be sacrificed to maximize aggregate reward. Our work offers a novel explanation for emergent abilities in RLVR, suggesting that the iterative optimization of solvable problems enables models to develop the capabilities to tackle previously unsolvable scenarios."}

We study the feature sensitivity problem, which asks whether an ensemble is sensitive to a specified subset of features -- such as protected attributes -- whose manipulation can alter model predictions. Existing approaches often yield examples of sensitivity that lie far from the training distribution, limiting their interpretability and practical value. We propose a data-aware sensitivity framework that constrains the sensitive examples to remain close to the dataset, thereby producing realistic and interpretable evidence of model weaknesses. To this end, we develop novel techniques for data-aware search using a combination of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) encodings. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we strengthen the NP-hardness result for sensitivity verification, showing it holds even for trees of depth 1. Second, we develop MILP-optimizations that significantly speed up sensitivity verification for single ensembles and for the first time can also handle multiclass tree ensembles. Third, we introduce a data-aware framework generating realistic examples close to the training distribution. Finally, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on large tree ensembles, demonstrating scalability to ensembles with up to 800 trees of depth 8, achieving substantial improvements over the state of the art. This framework provides a practical foundation for analyzing the reliability and fairness of tree-based models in high-stakes applications."}

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing. Stage 2 provides validation through geometric analysis of critic derivatives-first-order sensitivity and directional second-order curvature aggregated over causal windows to construct interpretable contagion graphs. This approach explains \"downstream-first\" detection anomalies by revealing pathways that amplify upstream deviations. Evaluated across 500 episodes in Simple Spread (3 and 5 agents) and 100 episodes in StarCraft II using MADDPG and HATRPO, our method achieves 88.2-99.4% Patient-0 detection accuracy while providing interpretable geometric evidence for detection decisions.

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, conventional practices rely on random sequences of fixed length, overlooking the variable-length nature of LLM inputs. Input length directly influences the activation distribution and, consequently, the weight importance captured by the Hessian, which in turn affects quantization outcomes. As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems."}

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) targets these mechanisms but faces scalability challenges. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) offers potential for delivering personalized DBT coaching at scale, yet rapid development has outpaced safety infrastructure. Methods: We developed Glow, a GenAI-powered DBT skills coach delivering chain and solution analysis for individuals at risk for HIV and substance use. In partnership with a Los Angeles community health organization, we conducted usability testing with clinical staff (n=6) and individuals with lived experience (n=28). Using the Helpful, Honest, and Harmless (HHH) framework, we employed user-driven adversarial testing wherein participants identified target behaviors and generated contextually realistic risk probes. We evaluated safety performance across 37 risk probe interactions. Results: Glow appropriately handled 73% of risk probes, but performance varied by agent. The solution analysis agent demonstrated 90% appropriate handling versus 44% for the chain analysis agent. Safety failures clustered around encouraging substance use and normalizing harmful behaviors. The chain analysis agent fell into an \"empathy trap,\" providing validation that reinforced maladaptive beliefs. Additionally, 27 instances of DBT skill misinformation were identified. Conclusions: This study provides the first systematic safety evaluation of GenAI-delivered DBT coaching for HIV and substance use risk reduction.

In a single-layer Transformer, we prove that the context-conditioned error vector decomposes additively into the baseline error vector and a contextual correction vector. This yields necessary geometric conditions for error reduction: the contextual correction must align with the negative baseline error and satisfy a norm constraint. We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity. These results extend to multi-context and multi-layer Transformers.

We establish a fundamental trade-off between allocation variability and regret, the canonical performance metric of reward maximization. In particular, for any algorithm, the worst-case regret $R_T$ and worst-case allocation variability $S_T$ must satisfy $R_T \\cdot S_T=Ω(T^{\\frac{3}{2}})$ as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, as long as $R_T=o(T)$.

The aim of this work is to form a comprehensive understanding of groundwater salinization underlying causal factors and identify important meteorological, geological and anthropogenic drivers of salinity. We have integrated different datasets of potential covariates, to create a robust framework for machine learning based predictive models including Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, Neural network, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolution neural network (CNN) and linear regression (LR), of groundwater salinity. Additionally, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) followed by Global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and Explainable AI (XAI) based SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to estimate the importance scores and find insights into the drivers of salinization. We also did causality analysis via Double machine learning using various predictive models. From these analyses, key meteorological (Precipitation, Temperature), geological (Distance from river, Distance to saline body, TWI, Shoreline distance), and anthropogenic (Area of agriculture field, Treated Wastewater) covariates are identified to be influential drivers of groundwater salinity across Israel. XAI analysis also identified Treated Wastewater (TWW) as an essential anthropogenic driver of salinity, its significance being context-dependent but critical in vulnerable hydro-climatic environment.

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies."}

Our empirical analysis reveals an alarming inconsistency in existing evaluations: the standard deviation across ten repeated runs of a single model on HumanEval (1.67) actually exceeds the performance gap among the top-10 models on the official leaderboard (0.91), rendering current rankings statistically precarious. To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the decentralized evaluation framework reduces the standard deviation across ten runs on the same model to 0.28. This significant improvement over conventional frameworks ensures higher statistical confidence in model rankings. We have completely implemented this platform and will soon release it to the community."}

In this paper, we propose a generative framework to simultaneously address multiple intent detection and slot filling. In particular, an attention-over-attention decoder is proposed to handle the variable number of intents and the interference between the two sub-tasks by incorporating an inductive bias into the process of multi-task learning. Besides, we construct two new multi-intent SLU datasets based on single-intent utterances by taking advantage of the next sentence prediction (NSP) head of the BERT model.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution."}

However, classical LoRA training methods treat the low-rank factor matrices individually and optimize them using standard gradient-based algorithms. Such decoupled optimization schemes are theoretically and empirically suboptimal, as they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic structure of the LoRA parameterization. In this work, we propose a novel continuous-time optimization dynamic for LoRA factor matrices in the form of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that emulates the gradient flow of full fine-tuning on the balanced manifold. We term this approach ODELoRA. To faithfully track the trajectories of ODELoRA, we adopt well-established and theoretically grounded time-discretization schemes, including Euler and Runge--Kutta methods. Our framework provides a unified ODE-based perspective for understanding and designing LoRA training algorithms. We establish linear convergence of the proposed method under strongly convex objectives for certain discretization schemes under mild conditions, and further extend our analysis to the matrix sensing setting. Moreover, we show that ODELoRA achieves stable feature learning, a property that is crucial for training deep neural networks at different scales of problem dimensionality. Empirical results on matrix sensing tasks confirm the derived linear convergence behavior, and experiments on training physics-informed neural networks further demonstrate the superiority of ODELoRA over existing baselines, especially in the training stability."}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient alternative due to their event-driven nature; however, their integration with continuous Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) representations is fundamentally challenged by distribution mismatch, where high-dynamic-range embeddings degrade the information coding capacity of threshold-based neurons. To resolve this, we propose Prompt-Tuned Spiking Neural Networks (PTS-SNN), a parameter-efficient neuromorphic adaptation framework that aligns frozen SSL backbones with spiking dynamics. Specifically, we introduce a Temporal Shift Spiking Encoder to capture local temporal dependencies via parameter-free channel shifts, establishing a stable feature basis. To bridge the domain gap, we devise a Context-Aware Membrane Potential Calibration strategy. This mechanism leverages a Spiking Sparse Linear Attention module to aggregate global semantic context into learnable soft prompts, which dynamically regulate the bias voltages of Parametric Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (PLIF) neurons. This regulation effectively centers the heterogeneous input distribution within the responsive firing range, mitigating functional silence or saturation. Extensive experiments on five multilingual datasets (e.g., IEMOCAP, CASIA, EMODB) demonstrate that PTS-SNN achieves 73.34\\% accuracy on IEMOCAP, comparable to competitive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while requiring only 1.19M trainable parameters and 0.35 mJ inference energy per sample."}

This has two key advantages. First, it captures the recurrent nature of CoT, but where the thought tokens are generated as input is processing. Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency. On state-tracking tasks, we show Thinking States leads to stronger reasoning behavior than CoT, successfully extrapolating to longer sequences than seen during training."}

To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data."}

We further derive a simple formula in terms of these statistics that predicts data-limited neural scaling exponents from first principles without any free parameters or synthetic data models.

UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt.

To unify various non-recurrent multi-path neural networks such as CNNs, ResNets, and Transformers, we introduce a graph-based notion of effective depth. Under stabilizing initializations and a maximal-update criterion, we show that the optimal learning rate decays with effective depth following a universal -3/2 power law. Here, the maximal-update criterion maximizes the typical one-step representation change at initialization without causing instability, and effective depth is the minimal path length from input to output, counting layers and residual additions. Experiments across diverse architectures confirm the predicted slope and enable reliable zero-shot transfer of learning rates across depths and widths, turning depth scaling into a predictable hyperparameter-transfer problem."}

In this work, we propose G-LNS, a generative evolutionary framework that extends LLM-based AHD to the automated design of Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operators. Unlike prior methods that evolve heuristics in isolation, G-LNS leverages LLMs to co-evolve tightly coupled pairs of destroy and repair operators. A cooperative evaluation mechanism explicitly captures their interaction, enabling the discovery of complementary operator logic that jointly performs effective structural disruption and reconstruction.

To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process. Experiments on several manipulation benchmarks and on a real robot demonstrate state-of-the-art success rates, superior inference efficiency, robust generalization against disturbances, and effective one-shot transfer."}

To evaluate the quality of the dataset and its impact on emotion classification, eight pre-trained Transformer-based models were evaluated under three preprocessing strategies: preserving original emojis with rule-based normalization, converting emojis into textual descriptions, and applying ViSoLex, a model-based lexical normalization system. Results show that converting emojis into text often improves the performance of several BERT-based baselines, while preserving emojis yields the best results for ViSoBERT and CafeBERT. In contrast, removing emojis generally leads to lower performance. ViSoBERT achieved the highest Macro F1-score of 61.50% and Weighted F1-score of 63.26%.

We implemented Puda as a browser-based system that serves as a common platform across diverse services and evaluated it through a personalized travel planning task. Our results show that providing Predefined Category Subsets achieves 97.2% of the personalization performance (evaluated via an LLM-as-a-Judge framework across three criteria) obtained when sharing Detailed Browsing History.

The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines.

To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

In this work, we propose TEAM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates MoE dLLMs by enabling more accepted tokens with fewer activated experts. TEAM is motivated by the observation that expert routing decisions exhibit strong temporal consistency across denoising levels as well as spatial consistency across token positions. Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates.

Although generative systems do not possess tacit knowledge in a phenomenological sense, they operationalize sensitivities to tone, intent, and situated judgment encoded in high-dimensional latent representations. On this basis, the human role shifts from algorithmic problem specification toward Vibe-Engineering, understood as the orchestration of alignment and contextual judgment in generative systems.\n  The paper connects this epistemological shift to educational and institutional transformation by proposing a conceptual framework structured across three analytical levels and three domains of action: faculty worldview, industry relations, and curriculum design. The risks of mode collapse and cultural homogenization are briefly discussed, emphasizing the need for deliberate engagement with generative systems to avoid regression toward synthetic uniformity."}

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup."}

Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization. While HID 2023 and HID 2024 already used this dataset, HID 2025 explicitly examined whether algorithmic advances could surpass the accuracy limits observed previously.

We formulate compression as selecting a smallest subgraph capturing a prescribed fraction of the probability mass, and reduce to a weighted version of densest $k$-subgraphs in hypergraphs, in the regime where the subgraph has a large fraction of edges. We design efficient approximation algorithms that achieve constant factor coverage and size trade-offs. Crucially, we prove that our relaxation satisfies a monotonicity property, derived from a connection to parametric minimum cuts, which guarantees the nestedness required for valid conformal guarantees.

To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs.

While prior studies have explored sycophantic behavior in general contexts, its impact on morally grounded visual decision-making remains insufficiently understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of moral sycophancy in VLMs, analyzing ten widely-used models on the Moralise and M^3oralBench datasets under explicit user disagreement. Our results reveal that VLMs frequently produce morally incorrect follow-up responses even when their initial judgments are correct, and exhibit a consistent asymmetry: models are more likely to shift from morally right to morally wrong judgments than the reverse when exposed to user-induced bias. Follow-up prompts generally degrade performance on Moralise, while yielding mixed or even improved accuracy on M^3oralBench, highlighting dataset-dependent differences in moral robustness. Evaluation using Error Introduction Rate (EIR) and Error Correction Rate (ECR) reveals a clear trade-off: models with stronger error-correction capabilities tend to introduce more reasoning errors, whereas more conservative models minimize errors but exhibit limited ability to self-correct. Finally, initial contexts with a morally right stance elicit stronger sycophantic behavior, emphasizing the vulnerability of VLMs to moral influence and the need for principled strategies to improve ethical consistency and robustness in multimodal AI systems."}

We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical findings, we propose a new vision within Chomsky's theory towards LLMs, and a shift of theoretical paradigm outside Chomsky, from his \"rationalist-romantics\" paradigm to functionalism and empiricism in LLMs research."}

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%). This work establishes a subspace-theoretic feature disentanglement framework for collaborative cross-camera cow identification, offering a new paradigm for precise animal monitoring in uncontrolled smart farming environments."}

To disentangle the two, we introduce Gaussian Match-and-Copy (GMC), a minimalist benchmark that isolates long-range retrieval through pure second-order correlation signals. Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting. Although many solutions are a priori possible under a regression objective, including ones that do not implement retrieval, we identify an implicit-bias regime in which gradient descent drives the parameters to diverge while their direction aligns with the max-margin separator, yielding hard match selection. We prove this max-margin alignment for GD trajectories that reach vanishing empirical loss under explicit technical conditions."}

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work. The evaluation compares the performance of the extended framework considering computational complexity, with energy savings being a major motivation for function offloading, and its capability to detect data from corrupted remote services."}

However, training these systems remains notoriously difficult due to the credit assignment challenge, as it is often unclear which specific functional agent is responsible for the success or failure of decision trajectories. Existing methods typically rely on sparse or globally broadcast rewards, failing to capture individual contributions and leading to inefficient reinforcement learning. To address these limitations, we introduce the Shapley-based Hierarchical Attribution for Reinforcement Policy (SHARP), a novel framework for optimizing multi-agent reinforcement learning via precise credit attribution. SHARP effectively stabilizes training by normalizing agent-specific advantages across trajectory groups, primarily through a decomposed reward mechanism comprising a global broadcast-accuracy reward, a Shapley-based marginal-credit reward for each agent, and a tool-process reward to improve execution efficiency. Extensive experiments across various real-world benchmarks demonstrate that SHARP significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average match improvements of 23.66% and 14.05% over single-agent and multi-agent approaches, respectively."}

To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures. (3) Based on this method, we construct the TRM-Preference dataset and train a Thinking Reward Model (TRM) to evaluate reasoning quality at scale. Experiments show that thinking rewards serve as an effective optimization signal. At test time, selecting better reasoning leads to better outcomes (up to 19.3% gain), and during RL training, thinking rewards enhance reasoning and performance (up to 3.9% gain) across diverse tasks."}

However most existing NN-based ensemble methods for TSC train multiple models with identical architectures and configurations. These ensembles aggregate predictions without explicitly promoting diversity which often leads to redundant feature representations and limits the benefits of ensembling. In this work, we introduce a diversity-driven ensemble learning framework that explicitly encourages feature diversity among neural network ensemble members. Our approach employs a decorrelated learning strategy using a feature orthogonality loss applied directly to the learned feature representations. This ensures that each model in the ensemble captures complementary rather than redundant information. We evaluate our framework on 128 datasets from the UCR archive and show that it achieves SOTA performance with fewer models. This makes our method both efficient and scalable compared to conventional NN-based ensemble approaches."}

To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation.

Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

In this paper, we propose an effect-centric, admissibility-first framework that treats discovered graphs as structural hypotheses and evaluates them by identifiability, stability, and falsification rather than by graph recovery accuracy alone. Empirically, we study the effect of early exposure to competitive gameplay on short-term retention using real-world game telemetry. We find that many statistically plausible discovery outputs do not admit point-identified causal queries once minimal temporal and semantic constraints are enforced, highlighting identifiability as a critical bottleneck for decision support. When identification is possible, several algorithm families converge to similar, decision-consistent effect estimates despite producing substantially different graph structures, including cases where the direct treatment-outcome edge is absent and the effect is preserved through indirect causal pathways. These converging estimates survive placebo, subsampling, and sensitivity refutation. In contrast, other methods exhibit sporadic admissibility and threshold-sensitive or attenuated effects due to endpoint ambiguity. These results suggest that graph-level metrics alone are inadequate proxies for causal reliability for a given target query. Therefore, trustworthy causal conclusions in telemetry-driven systems require prioritizing admissibility and effect-level validation over causal structural recovery alone."}

In this work, we investigate the process of table understanding by dissecting the atomic task of cell location. Through activation patching and complementary interpretability techniques, we delineate the table understanding mechanism into a sequential three-stage pipeline: Semantic Binding, Coordinate Localization, and Information Extraction. We demonstrate that models locate the target cell via an ordinal mechanism that counts discrete delimiters to resolve coordinates. Furthermore, column indices are encoded within a linear subspace that allows for precise steering of model focus through vector arithmetic. Finally, we reveal that models generalize to multi-cell location tasks by multiplexing the identical attention heads identified during atomic location. Our findings provide a comprehensive explanation of table understanding within Transformer architectures."}

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

While prior work has focused on Arrow's impossibility result, we argue that the impossibility often originates from pathological examples and identify sufficient conditions under which these disappear, and meaningful multi-criteria benchmarking becomes possible. In particular, we deal with three restrictions on the combinations of rankings and prove that on single-peaked, group-separable and distance-restricted preferences, the benchmark operator allows for the construction of well-behaved rankings of the involved models.

Recent methods leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance parallel thinking, aiming to address the limitations in computational resources and effectiveness encountered with supervised fine-tuning. However, most existing studies primarily focus on optimizing the aggregation phase, with limited attention to the path exploration stage. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the optimization of parallel thinking under the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) setting, and identify that the mutual information bottleneck among exploration paths fundamentally restricts overall performance. To address this, we propose Outline-Guided Path Exploration (OPE), which explicitly partitions the solution space by generating diverse reasoning outlines prior to parallel path reasoning, thereby reducing information redundancy and improving the diversity of information captured across exploration paths. We implement OPE with an iterative RL strategy that optimizes outline planning and outline-guided reasoning independently. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that OPE effectively improves reasoning performance in different aggregation strategies, enabling LRMs to more reliably discover correct solutions."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in advancing the field of quality estimation of machine translation. However, most of the QE approaches solely rely on scalar quality scores, offering no explicit information about the translation errors that should drive these judgments. Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR. Integrating error-aware rewards with ALOPE-RL, enables LLMs to reason about translation quality beyond numeric scores. Despite being trained on a small-scale QE dataset, ALOPE-RL achieves state-of-the-art performance on English to Malayalam QE using compact LLMs (<=4B parameters}) fine-tuned with LoRA and 4-bit quantization, outperforming both larger LLM-based baselines and leading encoder-based QE models. Our results demonstrate that error-aware, policy-based learning can deliver strong QE performance under limited data and compute budgets.

Existing mitigation strategies often face critical limitations: they either yield insufficient outlier suppression or incur significant deployment inefficiencies, such as inference latency, heavy preprocessing, or reliance on complex operator fusion. To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy. Crucially, Astro introduces zero inference latency and is orthogonal to mainstream quantization methods like GPTQ. Extensive experiments show that Astro achieves highly competitive performance; notably, on LLaMA-2-7B, it achieves better performance than complex learning-based rotation methods with almost 1/3 of the quantization time."}

The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts.

While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR).

Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1.

First, we present an approach for compiling a random forest classifier into a set of circuits, where each circuit directly encodes the instances in some class of the classifier. We show empirically that our proposed approach is significantly more efficient than existing similar approaches. Next, we utilize this approach to further obtain circuits that are tractable for computing the complete and general reasons of a decision, which are instance abstractions that play a fundamental role in computing explanations. Finally, we propose algorithms for computing the robustness of a decision and all shortest ways to flip it. We illustrate the utility of our contributions by using them to enumerate all sufficient reasons, necessary reasons and contrastive explanations of decisions; to compute the robustness of decisions; and to identify all shortest ways to flip the decisions made by random forest classifiers learned from a wide range of datasets."}

Although improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has attracted significant research efforts, the extent to which the fundamental paradigms induce generalization has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we shed light on how the interplay between these core paradigms influences LLMs' reasoning behavior. To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge. Then, we investigate effective ways for inducing these skills into LLMs. We experiment with a battery of methods including simple fine-tuning, and more complex approaches to increase model depth, or transform a dense model to a mixture-of-experts. We comprehensively evaluate induced models on realistic out-of-domain tasks, that are entirely formulated in natural language and contain real-world knowledge. Our results reveal that our approach yields strong generalizability with substantial performance gains (up to $14.60$) across realistic tasks."}

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

We propose ELM-INR, a backpropagation-free INR that decomposes the domain into overlapping subdomains and fits each local problem using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) in closed form, replacing iterative optimization with stable linear least-squares solutions. This design yields fast and numerically robust reconstruction by combining local predictors through a partition of unity. To understand where approximation becomes difficult under fixed local capacity, we analyze the method from a spectral Barron norm perspective, which reveals that global reconstruction error is dominated by regions with high spectral complexity. Building on this insight, we introduce BEAM, an adaptive mesh refinement strategy that balances spectral complexity across subdomains to improve reconstruction quality in capacity-constrained regimes."}

Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

We evaluate the semantic coherence and scoring reliability of LLM-defined criteria and their alignment with human criteria. LLMs reliably generate interpretable and task-aware evaluation dimensions and apply them consistently within models, but their scoring reliability degrades in factual and knowledge-intensive settings. Closed-source models such as GPT-4o achieve higher agreement and cross-model generalization than open-weight models such as Llama.

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs.

Our core contribution is a tutor-apprentice dialogue where a deterministic Logic Tutor, grounded in a formal safety ontology, provides causal and pedagogical feedback to an LLM planner. This enables intelligent plan repairs rather than mere avoidance. We also introduce a scalable knowledge acquisition pipeline that synthesizes safety knowledge bases from real-world documents, correcting blind spots in existing benchmarks. In challenging home safety tasks, VIRF achieves a perfect 0 percent Hazardous Action Rate (HAR) and a 77.3 percent Goal-Condition Rate (GCR), which is the highest among all baselines. It is highly efficient, requiring only 1.1 correction iterations on average. VIRF demonstrates a principled pathway toward building fundamentally trustworthy and verifiably safe embodied agents."}

While universal approximation theorems establish that sufficiently large architectures can approximate arbitrary continuous functions if there are no restrictions on the weight values, we show that dense neural networks do not possess this universality.

We consider ReLU neural networks subject to natural constraints on weights and input and output dimensions, which model a notion of dense connectivity. Within this setting, we demonstrate the existence of Lipschitz continuous functions that cannot be approximated by such networks. This highlights intrinsic limitations of neural networks with dense layers and motivates the use of sparse connectivity as a necessary ingredient for achieving true universality."}

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks."}

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline."}

We show that the resulting operator admits a clear geometric interpretation as a projection of distribution shift onto the sensitivity field of the model, yielding theoretical guarantees. Beyond detecting the presence of a shift, the same construction enables its localisation through a coordinate-wise decomposition, and for image data-provides interpretable per-pixel diagnostics.

We exploit the compositional nature of specifications written in SpectRL, and design four refinement procedures that modify the abstract graph of the specification by either refining its existing edge specifications or by introducing new edge specifications. We prove that all four procedures maintain specification soundness, i.e. any trajectory satisfying the refined specification also satisfies the original. We then show how \\textsc{AutoSpec} can be integrated with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for learning policies from logical specifications. Our experiments demonstrate that \\textsc{AutoSpec} yields promising improvements in terms of the complexity of control tasks that can be solved, when refined logical specifications produced by \\textsc{AutoSpec} are utilized."}

We demonstrate that these systems are highly vulnerable to imitation attacks, where adversaries steal proprietary capabilities by training imitation models on victim outputs. Crucially, existing LLM watermarking techniques fail in this domain because real-world agentic systems often operate as grey boxes, concealing the internal reasoning traces required for verification. This paper presents AGENTWM, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for agentic models. AGENTWM exploits the semantic equivalence of action sequences, injecting watermarks by subtly biasing the distribution of functionally identical tool execution paths. This mechanism allows AGENTWM to embed verifiable signals directly into the visible action trajectory while remaining indistinguishable to users. We develop an automated pipeline to generate robust watermark schemes and a rigorous statistical hypothesis testing procedure for verification. Extensive evaluations across three complex domains demonstrate that AGENTWM achieves high detection accuracy with negligible impact on agent performance. Our results confirm that AGENTWM effectively protects agentic IP against adaptive adversaries, who cannot remove the watermarks without severely degrading the stolen model's utility."}

Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics."}

We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts.

Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.\n  Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

However, when multiple devices transmit high-dimensional states (e.g., images or video frames) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks, a critical trade-off emerges between communication efficiency and control performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively. Control actions are derived within the embedding space, removing the need for state reconstruction. Simulation results on inverted cart-pole systems demonstrate that H-JEPA enables up to 42.83 % more devices to be supported under limited wireless capacity without compromising control performance."}

This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel, fully automated methodology for assessing the factual consistency of such summaries. The method is based on measuring the similarity between the claims in a given summary with those from the original reviews, measuring the coverage and consistency of the generated summary. To do so, we rely on a simple approach to extract factual assessment from texts that we then compare and summarize in a suitable score. We demonstrate that the proposed metric attributes higher scores to similar claims, regardless of whether the claim is negated, paraphrased, or expanded, and that the score has a high correlation to human judgment when compared to state-of-the-art metrics."}

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that a lightweight quadrotor achieves robust, collision-free navigation in complex forest environments at speeds up to 10 m/s, exhibiting significant resilience to drastic lighting variations without fine-tuning."}

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism. We initialise three tasks with PERSPECTRA: opinion counting (identifying distinct viewpoints), opinion matching (aligning supporting stances and discourse to source opinions), and polarity check (inferring aggregate stance in mixed discourse). Experiments with state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, highlight systematic failures, such as overestimating the number of viewpoints and misclassifying concessive structures, underscoring the difficulty of pluralism-aware understanding and reasoning.

The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools.

We introduce Feroma, a novel FL framework that explicitly handles both distribution shift and drift without relying on client or cluster identity. Feroma builds on client distribution profiles-compact, privacy-preserving representations of local data-that guide model aggregation and test-time model assignment through adaptive similarity-based weighting. This design allows Feroma to dynamically select aggregation strategies during training, ranging from clustered to personalized, and deploy suitable models to unseen, and unlabeled test clients without retraining, online adaptation, or prior knowledge on clients' data. Extensive experiments show that compared to 10 state-of-the-art methods, Feroma improves performance and stability under dynamic data heterogeneity conditions-an average accuracy gain of up to 12 percentage points over the best baselines across 6 benchmarks-while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization.

A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

Specifically, the proposed method consists of two phases: i) In the first phase for pretraining, the policy is created in a behavior cloning (BC) manner, through leveraging the learning data from our AR-based remote human-robot interaction system; ii) In the second phase, a contrastive learning empowered reinforcement learning (RL) method is developed to obtain more efficient and robust policy than the BC, and thus a projection head is designed to accelerate the learning progress. An event-driven augmented reward is adopted for enhancing the safety. To validate the proposed method, both the physics simulations via PyBullet and real-world experiments are carried out. The results demonstrate that compared to the classic proximal policy optimization and soft actor-critic policies, our method not only significantly speeds up the inference, but also achieves much better performance in terms of the success rate for fulfilling the manipulation tasks.

Adopting a two-agent game paradigm, a user agent constructs dynamic environments via style mimicry (learning user-specific conversational traits) and active termination (predicting turn-level termination probabilities as immediate rewards), forming an iterative cycle that drives the dialogue agent to deepen interest exploration. AT-GRPO reinterprets dialogue trajectories as trees and introduces adaptive observation ranges. Unlike full tree expansion that incurs exponential overhead, it limits each node to aggregate rewards from a stage-aware range: larger ranges support early-stage topic exploration, while smaller ranges facilitate late-stage dialogue maintenance. This design reduces rollout budgets from exponential to polynomial in the dialogue length, while preserving long-term reward capture.

For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs."}

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

Through this lens, existing methods can be understood as special cases that optimize only subsets of these dimensions. Building upon this decomposition, a novel framework called PRISM (Propose-Review-Integrate Synthesis for Multi-agent Reasoning) is proposed, which jointly maximizes all three dimensions through role-based diversity, execution-grounded feedback with evidence-based cross-evaluation, and iterative synthesis with closed-loop validation. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and function calling benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior compute-efficiency compared to methods optimizing partial dimensions.

In this work, we propose dense feature learning, a representation centric framework that explicitly shapes the linear structure of medical embeddings. Our approach operates directly on embedding matrices, encouraging spectral balance, subspace consistency, and feature orthogonality through objectives defined entirely in terms of linear algebraic properties. Without relying on labels or generative reconstruction, dense feature learning produces representations with higher effective rank, improved conditioning, and greater stability across time. Empirical evaluations across longitudinal EHR data, clinical text, and multimodal patient representations demonstrate consistent improvements in downstream linear performance, robustness, and subspace alignment compared to supervised and self supervised baselines.

To address this, we propose the Explanation-Generalization Score (EGS), a metric that quantifies the causal relevance of GNN explanations. EGS is founded on the principle of feature invariance and posits that if an explanation captures true causal drivers, it should lead to stable predictions across distribution shifts. To quantify this, we introduce a framework that trains GNNs using explanatory subgraphs and evaluates their performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) settings (here, OOD generalization serves as a rigorous proxy for the explanation's causal validity). Through large-scale validation involving 11,200 model combinations across synthetic and real-world datasets, our results demonstrate that EGS provides a principled benchmark for ranking explainers based on their ability to capture causal substructures, offering a robust alternative to traditional fidelity-based metrics."}

L-LIO augments driver and scene understanding through multimodal fusion of audio and visual sensing, offering new paths for safety intervention."}

Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: unified embedding retrieval, which suffers from single-model myopia, and heuristic agentic retrieval, which is limited by suboptimal, trial-and-error orchestration. To this end, we propose OSCAR, an optimization-steered agentic planning framework for composed image retrieval. We are the first to reformulate agentic CIR from a heuristic search process into a principled trajectory optimization problem. Instead of relying on heuristic trial-and-error exploration, OSCAR employs a novel offline-online paradigm. In the offline phase, we model CIR via atomic retrieval selection and composition as a two-stage mixed-integer programming problem, mathematically deriving optimal trajectories that maximize ground-truth coverage for training samples via rigorous boolean set operations. These trajectories are then stored in a golden library to serve as in-context demonstrations for online steering of VLM planner at online inference time. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks and a private industrial benchmark show that OSCAR consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Notably, it achieves superior performance using only 10% of training data, demonstrating strong generalization of planning logic rather than dataset-specific memorization."}

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions. By bridging advances in LLM reasoning with principles of responsible and inclusive AI, this work contributes to more equitable geospatial data systems for humanitarian response, advancing the goal of leaving no place behind in crisis analytics."}

Empirical scaling laws are widely used to predict loss as model size and training data grow, however, almost all existing studies fix the optimizer (typically AdamW). At the same time, a new generation of optimizers (e.g., Muon, Shampoo, SOAP) promises faster and more stable convergence, but their relationship with model and data scaling is not yet well understood. In this work, we study scaling laws across different optimizers. Empirically, we show that 1) separate Chinchilla-style scaling laws for each optimizer are ill-conditioned and have highly correlated parameters. Instead, 2) we propose a more robust law with shared power-law exponents and optimizer-specific rescaling factors, which enable direct comparison between optimizers.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

This characterisation shows that debate is remarkably query-efficient: even for highly complex problems, logarithmic oversight suffices. We also establish that functions depending on all their input bits require Omega(log n) queries, and that any function computable by a circuit of size s satisfies DQC(f) <= log(s) + 3. Interestingly, this last result implies that proving DQC lower bounds of log(n) + 6 for languages in P would yield new circuit lower bounds, connecting debate query complexity to central questions in circuit complexity."}

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference."}

However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable performance on both long video understanding and grounding."}

In this work we propose a rigorous analysis of such approximate posterior-samplers, relying on a Gaussianity assumption of the prior. Under this regime, we show that both the ideal posterior sampler and diffusion-based reconstruction algorithms can be expressed in closed-form, enabling their thorough analysis and comparisons in the spectral domain. Building on these representations, we also introduce a principled framework for parameter design, replacing heuristic selection strategies used to date. The proposed approach is method-agnostic and yields tailored parameter choices for each algorithm, jointly accounting for the characteristics of the prior, the degraded signal, and the diffusion dynamics. We show that our spectral recommendations differ structurally from standard heuristics and vary with the diffusion step size, resulting in a consistent balance between perceptual quality and signal fidelity."}

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

While regulatory and policy frameworks tend to define trust in normative terms, the trust users place in chatbots often emerges from behavioral mechanisms.

Based on this observation, we propose reframing chatbots not as companions or assistants, but as highly skilled salespeople whose objectives are determined by the deploying organization. We argue that the coexistence of competing notions of \"trust\" under a shared term obscures important distinctions between psychological trust formation and normative trustworthiness. Addressing this gap requires further research and stronger support mechanisms to help users appropriately calibrate trust in conversational AI systems."}

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images.

We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

Our comparative study reveals a concerning lack of consensus on the most effective XAI evaluation techniques, underscoring the need for further research and standardization in this area."}

NCP predicts discrete concepts that span multiple tokens, thereby forming a more challenging pretraining objective. Our model, ConceptLM, quantizes hidden states using Vector Quantization and constructs a concept vocabulary. It leverages both NCP and NTP to drive parameter updates and generates a concept to guide the generation of the following tokens. We train ConceptLM from scratch at scales ranging from 70M to 1.5B parameters with up to 300B training data, including Pythia and GPT-2 backbones. Results on 13 benchmarks show that NCP yields consistent performance gains over traditional token-level models. Furthermore, continual pretraining experiments on an 8B-parameter Llama model indicate that NCP can further improve an NTP-trained model. Our analysis suggests that NCP leads to more powerful language models by introducing a harder pretraining task, providing a promising path toward better language modeling."}

Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion. Experiments on fastMRI brain data and prospectively acquired in vivo diffusion MRI data demonstrate improved fidelity and reduced slice leakage over conventional and learning-based SMS reconstructions."}

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized."}

Despite recent advances, the scalability of existing POMDP solvers remains limited. Moreover, many settings require a policy that is robust across multiple POMDPs, further aggravating the scalability issue. We propose the Lexpop framework for POMDP solving. Lexpop (1) employs deep reinforcement learning to train a neural policy, represented by a recurrent neural network, and (2) constructs a finite-state controller mimicking the neural policy through efficient extraction methods. Crucially, unlike neural policies, such controllers can be formally evaluated, providing performance guarantees. We extend Lexpop to compute robust policies for hidden-model POMDPs (HM-POMDPs), which describe finite sets of POMDPs. We associate every extracted controller with its worst-case POMDP. Using a set of such POMDPs, we iteratively train a robust neural policy and consequently extract a robust controller. Our experiments show that on problems with large state spaces, Lexpop outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for POMDPs as well as HM-POMDPs."}

These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS."}

This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes.

Adaptive Data Analysis (ADA) mechanisms address this challenge; however, there is a fundamental tension between computational efficiency and sample complexity. For $T$ rounds of adaptive analysis, computationally efficient algorithms typically incur suboptimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ sample complexity, whereas statistically optimal $O(\\log T)$ algorithms are computationally intractable under standard cryptographic assumptions. In this work, we shed light on this trade-off by identifying a natural class of data distributions under which both computational efficiency and optimal sample complexity are achievable. We propose a computationally efficient ADA mechanism that attains optimal $O(\\log T)$ sample complexity when the data distribution is dense with respect to a known prior. This setting includes, in particular, feature--label data distributions arising in distribution-specific learning. As a consequence, our mechanism also yields a sample-efficient (i.e., $O(\\log T)$ samples) statistical query oracle in the distribution-specific setting. Moreover, although our algorithm is not based on differential privacy, it satisfies a relaxed privacy notion known as Predicate Singling Out (PSO) security (Cohen and Nissim, 2020). Our results thus reveal an inherent connection between adaptive data analysis and privacy beyond differential privacy."}

Second, continual learning, in the sense of updating the model while serving a data stream, often produces interference because a small update touches broadly shared weights.\n  We propose Attractor Patch Networks (APN), a plug-compatible replacement for the Transformer FFN. APN is a bank of patch experts. A similarity router selects a small top-k set of patches for each token by matching the token representation to learned prototypes. Each selected patch emits a low-rank residual update conditioned on a compact code. The architecture yields conditional, context-specialized nonlinear transformations while preserving the standard Transformer interface.\n  This paper focuses on APN as an architectural primitive. We formalize APN, analyze its expressivity as a piecewise low-rank residual function class, and derive simple interference and stability arguments that make APN naturally compatible with continual learning. In experiments on character-level language modeling, APN achieves competitive perplexity (4.57 vs 4.32 PPL) while enabling dramatically better continual adaptation: when adapting to a shifted domain, APN achieves 2.6 times better retention (11.1 vs 29.4 PPL on the original domain) and 2.8 times better adaptation (6.4 vs 17.8 PPL on the new domain) compared to global fine-tuning of a dense FFN baseline."}

TerraBind tests this hypothesis through a coarse pocket-level representation (protein C$_β$ atoms and ligand heavy atoms only) within a multimodal architecture combining COATI-3 molecular encodings and ESM-2 protein embeddings that learns rich structural representations, which are used in a diffusion-free optimization module for pose generation and a binding affinity likelihood prediction module.

In this paper, we present LLM-FSM, a benchmark that evaluates how well large language models (LLMs) can recover finite-state machine (FSM) behavior from natural-language specifications and translate it into correct register transfer-level (RTL) implementations. Unlike prior specification-to-RTL benchmarks that rely on manually constructed examples, LLM-FSM is built through a fully automated pipeline. LLM-FSM first constructs FSM with configurable state counts and constrained transition structures. It then prompts LLMs to express each FSM in a structured YAML format with an application context, and to further convert that YAML into a natural-language (NL) specification. From the same YAML, our pipeline synthesizes the reference RTL and testbench in a correct-by-construction manner. All 1,000 problems are verified using LLM-based and SAT-solver-based checks, with human review on a subset. Our experiments show that even the strongest LLMs exhibit sharply declining accuracy as FSM complexity increases. We further demonstrate that training-time scaling via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, while increasing test-time compute improves reasoning reliability. Finally, LLM-FSM remains extensible by allowing its FSM complexity to scale with future model capabilities."}

We introduce \\textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps.

While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

We derive three equivalent characterizations of the manifold average velocity (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and semigroup identities), and analyze parameterizations and stabilization techniques to improve training on high-dimensional manifolds.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Negative-Aware Diffusion model for TKG Extrapolation (NADEx). Specifically, NADEx encodes subject-centric histories of entities, relations and temporal intervals into sequential embeddings. NADEx perturbs the query object in the forward process and reconstructs it in reverse with a Transformer denoiser conditioned on the temporal-relational context. We further derive a cosine-alignment regularizer derived from batch-wise negative prototypes, which tightens the decision boundary against implausible candidates.

We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%.

Because target quantities are typically unobservable, we develop an evaluation framework based on necessary conditions: calibration against verifiable proxies, sensitivity to evidence, and alignment with human expert judgment. We evaluate in the domain of AI-augmented cybersecurity risk, using three capability benchmarks and independent human elicitation studies. LLM panels achieve strong correlations with benchmark ground truth (Pearson r=0.87-0.95), improve systematically as evidence is added, and align with human expert panels - in one comparison, closer to a human panel than the two human panels are to each other. This demonstrates that LLM-based elicitation can extend structured expert judgment to settings where traditional methods are infeasible, reducing elicitation time from months to minutes."}

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for code generation [Chen et al., 2021; Huynh and Lin, 2025], their effectiveness in domain-specific enterprise contexts remains underexplored, particularly when both retrieval and modification tasks must be handled jointly. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) variants [Lewis et al., 2021] -- standard RAG, Self-RAG [Asai et al., 2024], and CoRAG [Wang et al., 2025] -- across SQL query generation, REST API call generation, and a combined task requiring dynamic task classification. Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%). Critically, CoRAG proves most robust in hybrid documentation settings, achieving statistically significant improvements in the combined task (10.29% exact match vs. 7.45% for standard RAG), driven primarily by superior SQL generation performance (15.32% vs. 11.56%). Our findings establish retrieval-policy design as a key determinant of production-grade natural language interfaces, showing that iterative query decomposition outperforms both top-k retrieval and binary relevance filtering under documentation heterogeneity."}

Our results show that when evaluated against human annotations, VLMs tend to predict the presence of privacy attributes more often than human annotators.

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection.

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods."}

We bypass all of this.\n  We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations."}

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines.

We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way.

In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods.

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning."}

Yet while architectural complexity has been studied, the structural complexity embedded within requirements specifications remains poorly understood and inadequately quantified. This gap is consequential: requirements fundamentally drive system design, and complexity introduced at this stage propagates through architecture, implementation, and integration. To address this gap, we build on Natural Language Processing methods that extract structural networks from textual requirements. Using these extracted structures, we conducted a controlled experiment employing molecular integration tasks as structurally isomorphic proxies for requirements integration - leveraging the topological equivalence between molecular graphs and requirement networks while eliminating confounding factors such as domain expertise and semantic ambiguity. Our results demonstrate that spectral measures predict integration effort with correlations exceeding 0.95, while structural metrics achieve correlations above 0.89. Notably, density-based metrics show no significant predictive validity. These findings indicate that eigenvalue-derived measures capture cognitive and effort dimensions that simpler connectivity metrics cannot. As a result, this research bridges a critical methodological gap between architectural complexity analysis and requirements engineering practice, providing a validated foundation for applying these metrics to requirements engineering, where similar structural complexity patterns may predict integration effort."}

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that FSP-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image quality and computational efficiency, underscoring its potential for clinically viable ultra-low-dose spectral CT imaging."}

Such loads are characterized by fast workload-driven variability and protection-driven disconnection and reconnection behavior that are not captured by conventional load models. Existing data center load modeling includes physics-based approaches, which provide interpretable structure for grid simulation, and data-driven approaches, which capture empirical workload variability from data. However, physics-based models are typically uncalibrated to facility-level operation, while trajectory alignment in data-driven methods often leads to overfitting and unrealistic dynamic behavior. To resolve these limitations, we design the framework to leverage both physics-based structure and data-driven adaptability. The physics-based structure is parameterized to enable data-driven pattern-consistent calibration from real operational data, supporting facility-level grid planning. We further show that trajectory-level alignment is limited for inherently stochastic data center loads. Therefore, we design the calibration to align temporal and statistical patterns using temporal contrastive learning (TCL). This calibration is performed locally at the facility, and only calibrated parameters are shared with utilities, preserving data privacy. The proposed load model is calibrated by real-world operational load data from the MIT Supercloud, ASU Sol, Blue Waters, and ASHRAE datasets. Then it is integrated into the ANDES platform and evaluated on the IEEE 39-bus, NPCC 140-bus, and WECC 179-bus systems. We find that interactions among LELs can fundamentally alter post-disturbance recovery behavior, producing compound disconnection-reconnection dynamics and delayed stabilization that are not captured by uncalibrated load models."}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a framework for aligning these models with task-specific rewards, improving overall quality and reliability. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is an efficient, value-function-free alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that leverages group-relative reward normalization. We introduce Iterative Group Relative Policy Optimization (iGRPO), a two-stage extension of GRPO that adds dynamic self-conditioning through model-generated drafts. In Stage 1, iGRPO samples multiple exploratory drafts and selects the highest-reward draft using the same scalar reward signal used for optimization. In Stage 2, it appends this best draft to the original prompt and applies a GRPO-style update on draft-conditioned refinements, training the policy to improve beyond its strongest prior attempt. Under matched rollout budgets, iGRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across base models (e.g., Nemotron-H-8B-Base-8K and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled), validating its effectiveness on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, applying iGRPO to OpenReasoning-Nemotron-7B trained on AceReason-Math achieves new state-of-the-art results of 85.62\\% and 79.64\\% on AIME24 and AIME25, respectively. Ablations further show that the refinement wrapper generalizes beyond GRPO variants, benefits from a generative judge, and alters learning dynamics by delaying entropy collapse.

Treating next-token prediction in language models as a classification task allows us to apply OOD techniques, provided appropriate modifications are made to account for the structural differences in large language models. We show that OOD-based approaches yield training-free, single-sample-based detectors, achieving strong accuracy in hallucination detection for reasoning tasks. Overall, our work suggests that reframing hallucination detection as OOD detection provides a promising and scalable pathway toward language model safety."}

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques."}

However, realizing such soft policies in practice remains challenging. Existing approaches either depend on parametric policies with limited expressivity or employ diffusion-based policies whose intractable likelihoods hinder reliable entropy estimation in soft policy objectives. We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement. On OpenAI Gym MuJoCo benchmarks, NC-LQL achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods, providing a simple yet powerful solution for online RL."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone. Leveraging this alignment, we forecast frontier model capabilities in terms of human task length and independently reproduce METR's exponential scaling results, with the 50% solvable task horizon doubling approximately every 6 months."}

In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%.

To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics.

We then apply the representations of functional groups and atoms learned by the model to tackle problems of toxicity, solubility, drug-likeness, and synthesis accessibility on smaller datasets using the learned representations as features for graph convolution and attention models on the graph structure of molecules, as well as fine-tuning of BERT.

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving."}

In this paper, a novel anti-exploration method based on Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and fuzzy clustering in offline RL is proposed.

Human personality, for instance, shapes how individuals navigate social interactions, including strategic choices and behaviors in emotionally charged interactions. This raises the question: Can LLMs, when prompted with personality traits, reproduce personality-driven differences in human conflict behavior? To explore this, we introduce an evaluation framework that enables direct comparison of human-human and LLM-LLM behaviors in dispute resolution dialogues with respect to Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality traits. This framework provides a set of interpretable metrics related to strategic behavior and conflict outcomes. We additionally contribute a novel dataset creation methodology for LLM dispute resolution dialogues with matched scenarios and personality traits with respect to human conversations. Finally, we demonstrate the use of our evaluation framework with three contemporary closed-source LLMs and show significant divergences in how personality manifests in conflict across different LLMs compared to human data, challenging the assumption that personality-prompted agents can serve as reliable behavioral proxies in socially impactful applications. Our work highlights the need for psychological grounding and validation in AI simulations before real-world use."}

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysDrape achieves state-of-the-art performance, ensuring negligible interpenetration with significantly lower strain energy compared to existing baselines, achieving superior physical fidelity and robustness in real-time."}

We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines. For instance, on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct under SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO, OGPSA preserves strong safety while recovering general capability, improving SimpleQA from 0.53\\% to 3.03\\% and IFEval from 51.94\\% to 63.96\\%.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines.

In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between theory and practice through the lens of heavy-tailed gradient noise, a phenomenon frequently observed in language modeling tasks. Theoretically, we introduce a novel generalized heavy-tailed noise condition that captures the behavior of LLMs more accurately than standard finite variance assumptions.

These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency.

However, its widespread adoption is hindered by a reliance on untestable causal assumptions and by the lack of robustness-oriented evaluation in existing benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose CausalCompass, a flexible and extensible benchmark suite designed to assess the robustness of time-series causal discovery (TSCD) methods under violations of modeling assumptions. To demonstrate the practical utility of CausalCompass, we conduct extensive benchmarking of representative TSCD algorithms across eight assumption-violation scenarios. Our experimental results indicate that no single method consistently attains optimal performance across all settings. Nevertheless, the methods exhibiting superior overall performance across diverse scenarios are almost invariably deep learning-based approaches. We further provide hyperparameter sensitivity analyses to deepen the understanding of these findings. We also find, somewhat surprisingly, that NTS-NOTEARS relies heavily on standardized preprocessing in practice, performing poorly in the vanilla setting but exhibiting strong performance after standardization. Finally, our work aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of TSCD methods under assumption violations, thereby facilitating their broader adoption in real-world applications. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/huiyang-yi/CausalCompass."}

In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks.

As a result, Hessian estimates derived from fixed-length calibration may fail to represent the true importance of weights across diverse input scenarios. We propose MaCa (Matryoshka Calibration), a simple yet effective method for length-aware Hessian construction. MaCa (i) incorporates multi-scale sequence length information into Hessian estimation and (ii) regularizes each sequence as an independent sample, yielding a more stable and fruitful Hessian for accurate quantization. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3, LLaMA3) demonstrate that MaCa consistently improves accuracy under low bit quantization, offering a lightweight enhancement compatible with existing PTQ frameworks.

We argue that uncritical uptake of these discourses risks reproducing corporate priorities and constraining alternative approaches to governance and design. The contribution of this work is twofold: first, to situate safety as a sociotechnical discourse that warrants critical examination; second, to caution human-computer interaction scholars against legitimizing corporate framings, instead foregrounding accountability, equity, and justice.

This study investigates the effectiveness of attention-based deep learning models for early PD detection using tabular biomedical data.

TabNet and MLP demonstrated competitive performance, while Gradient Boosting yielded the lowest overall scores. The superior performance of SAINT is attributed to its dual attention mechanism, which effectively models feature interactions within and across samples.\n  These findings demonstrate the diagnostic potential of attention-based deep learning architectures for early Parkinson's disease detection and highlight the importance of dynamic feature representation in clinical prediction tasks."}

We identified a geometric modularization where layers self-organize into stable low- and high-complexity clusters. The low-complexity module, characterized by reduced entropy and curvature, consistently better predicted human language network activity. This alignment followed heterogeneous spatial-temporal trajectories: rapid and stable in temporal regions (AntTemp, PostTemp), but delayed and dynamic in frontal areas (IFG, IFGorb). Crucially, reduced curvature remained a robust predictor of model-brain alignment even after controlling for training progress, an effect that strengthened with model scale. These results links training-driven geometric reorganization to temporal-frontal functional specialization, suggesting that representational smoothing facilitates neural-like linguistic processing."}

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

In Part~I of this series, we modeled learning as a transport process in the space of parameter distributions and derived the Epistemic Speed Limit, which lower-bounds entropy production under finite-time learning.\n  In this work (Part~II), we study the consequences of this irreversibility for continual learning from a trajectory-level perspective. We show that finite dissipation constrains not only which solutions are reachable, but which learning paths remain dynamically accessible.\n  Although a continuum of task-equivalent realizations can achieve identical task performance, finite-time learning irreversibly selects among these realizations. This selection occurs through the progressive elimination of degrees of freedom that would otherwise enable structural reconfiguration. We refer to this phenomenon as \\emph{critical period closure}: beyond a certain stage of learning, transitions between compatible representations become dynamically inaccessible under any finite dissipation budget.\n  As a result, continual learning failure arises not from the absence of solutions satisfying multiple tasks, but from an irreversible loss of representational freedom induced by prior learning. This reframes catastrophic forgetting as a dynamical constraint imposed by finite-time dissipation, rather than direct task interference."}

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling."}

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting.

Recent work has therefore called for involving affected individuals in fairness assessment, yet little empirical evidence exists on how they create their own fairness criteria or what kinds of criteria they produce - knowledge that could not only inform experts' fairness evaluation and mitigation, but also guide the design of AI assessment tools. We address this gap through a qualitative user study with 18 participants in a credit rating scenario. Participants first articulated their fairness notions in their own words. Then, participants turned them into concrete quantified and operationalized fairness criteria, through an interactive prototype we designed. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the process through which people's fairness notions emerge via grounding in model features, and uncover a diverse set of individuals' custom-defined criteria for both outcome and procedural fairness.

We find that illusory completion frequently occurs, wherein agents believe tasks are complete despite unresolved or violated constraints, leading to underverified answers. To diagnose this behavior, we introduce the Epistemic Ledger, an evaluation framework that tracks evidential support and agents' beliefs for each constraint throughout multi-turn reasoning. Our analysis reveals four recurring failure patterns: bare assertions, overlooked refutations, stagnation, and premature exit. Motivated by these findings, we examine whether explicit constraint-state tracking during execution mitigates these failures via LiveLedger, an inference-time tracker. This simple intervention consistently improves performance, substantially reducing underverified answers (by up to 26.5%) and improving overall accuracy (by up to 11.6%) on multi-constraint problems."}

While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors. We evaluate our method on both image-to-video (I2V) and video-to-video (V2V) tasks in terms of camera control accuracy and visual fidelity. Our results demonstrate that ReRoPE offers a training-efficient path toward controllable, high-fidelity video generation. See project page for more results: https://sisyphe-lee.github.io/ReRoPE/"}

Learning in this setting proceeds by first computing (a subset of) the possible combinations of labels that satisfy the formula and then computing a loss using those combinations and the classifiers' scores. One challenge is that the space of label combinations can grow exponentially, making learning difficult. We propose a technique that prunes this space by exploiting the intuition that instances with similar latent representations are likely to share the same label. While this intuition has been widely used in weakly supervised learning, its application in our setting is challenging due to label dependencies imposed by logical constraints. We formulate the pruning process as an integer linear program that discards inconsistent label combinations while respecting logical structure. Our approach, CLIPPER, is orthogonal to existing training algorithms and can be seamlessly integrated with them. Across 16 benchmarks over complex neurosymbolic tasks, we demonstrate that CLIPPER boosts the performance of state-of-the-art neurosymbolic engines like Scallop, Dolphin, and ISED by up to 48%, 53%, and 8%, leading to state-of-the-art accuracies."}

Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

This works in static regimes but breaks under distributional shift, task permutation, and continual learning, where even mild topological changes can invalidate learned solutions and trigger catastrophic forgetting. We propose Metric-Topology Factorization (MTF) as a unifying geometric principle: intelligence is not navigation through a fixed maze, but the ability to reshape representational geometry so desired behaviors become stable attractors. Learning corresponds to metric contraction (a controlled deformation of Riemannian structure), while task identity and environmental variation are encoded topologically and stored separately in memory. We show any fixed metric is geometrically incomplete: for any local metric representation, some topological transformations make it singular or incoherent, implying an unavoidable stability-plasticity tradeoff for weight-based systems. MTF resolves this by factorizing stable topology from plastic metric warps, enabling rapid adaptation via geometric switching rather than re-optimization. Building on this, we introduce the Topological Urysohn Machine (TUM), implementing MTF through memory-amortized metric inference (MAMI): spectral task signatures index amortized metric transformations, letting a single learned geometry be reused across permuted, reflected, or parity-altered environments. This explains robustness to task reordering, resistance to catastrophic forgetting, and generalization across transformations that defeat conventional continual learning methods (e.g., EWC)."}

However, most existing approaches emphasize whole-brain age prediction and therefore overlook the pronounced regional heterogeneity of brain maturation that is crucial for detecting localized atypical trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose a novel spherical surface-based brain age prediction network (SurfAge-Net) that leverages multiple morphological metrics to capture region-specific developmental patterns with enhanced robustness and clinical interpretability. SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations. These results established fine-grained brain age prediction as a promising paradigm for advancing neurodevelopmental research and supporting early clinical assessment."}

Unlike prior approaches that ignore future interventions or directly use large language models (LLMs) for numerical forecasting, EventCast leverages LLMs solely for event-driven reasoning. Unstructured business data, which covers campaigns, holiday schedules, and seller incentives, from existing operational databases, is processed by an LLM that converts it into interpretable textual summaries leveraging world knowledge for cultural nuances and novel event combinations. These summaries are fused with historical demand features within a dual-tower architecture, enabling accurate, explainable, and scalable forecasts. Deployed on real-world e-commerce scenarios spanning 4 countries of 160 regions over 10 months, EventCast achieves up to 86.9% and 97.7% improvement on MAE and MSE compared to the variant without event knowledge, and reduces MAE by up to 57.0% and MSE by 83.3% versus the best industrial baseline during event-driven periods.

We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision.

Despite this progress, it remains unclear which compositional problems are learnable in this setting using outcome-level feedback alone. In this work, we theoretically study the learnability of compositional problems in autoregressive models under RLVR training. We identify a quantity that we call the task-advantage ratio, a joint property of the compositional problem and the base model, that characterizes which tasks and compositions are learnable from outcome-level feedback. On the positive side, using this characterization, we show that compositional problems where correct intermediate steps provide a clear advantage are efficiently learnable with RLVR. We also analyze how such an advantage naturally arises in different problems. On the negative side, when the structural advantage is not present, RLVR may converge to suboptimal compositions. We prove that, in some cases, the quality of the base model determines if such an advantage exists and whether RLVR will converge to a suboptimal solution. We hope our analysis can provide a principled theoretical understanding of when and why RLVR succeeds and when it does not."}

Dedicated subnetworks are used to process EEG features and auxiliary modalities, and a shared autoencoder-based fusion module is used to learn discriminative latent representations before classification. Subject-dependent experiments conducted on the PhyMER dataset across seven emotional classes achieve an accuracy of 95.45%, surpassing previously reported results. Furthermore, temporal attention analysis provides interpretable insights into emotion-specific temporal relevance, and t-SNE visualizations demonstrate enhanced class separability, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, statistical analysis of temporal dynamics confirms that the network self-organizes into distinct functional groups with specialized fast and slow neurons, proving it independently tunes learnable time constants and memory dominance to effectively capture complex emotion artifacts."}

This study aims to systematically evaluate how sequence modelling architecture, representation choice, sequence length, and training data availability influence automated log parsing performance and computational cost. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing four sequence modelling architectures: Transformer, Mamba state-space, monodirectional LSTM, and bidirectional LSTM models. In total, 396 models are trained across multiple dataset configurations and evaluated using relative Levenshtein edit distance with statistical significance testing. Transformer achieves the lowest mean relative edit distance (0.111), followed by Mamba (0.145), mono-LSTM (0.186), and bi-LSTM (0.265), where lower values are better. Mamba provides competitive accuracy with substantially lower computational cost. Character-level tokenization generally improves performance, sequence length has negligible practical impact on Transformer accuracy, and both Mamba and Transformer demonstrate stronger sample efficiency than recurrent models. Overall, Transformers reduce parsing error by 23.4%, while Mamba is a strong alternative under data or compute constraints. These results also clarify the roles of representation choice, sequence length, and sample efficiency, providing practical guidance for researchers and practitioners."}

However, when multiple devices transmit high-dimensional states (e.g., images or video frames) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks, a critical trade-off emerges between communication efficiency and control performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) for scalable predictive control. Instead of transmitting states, device observations are encoded into low-dimensional embeddings that preserve essential dynamics. The proposed architecture employs a three-level hierarchical prediction, with high-level, medium-level, and low-level predictors operating across different temporal resolutions, to achieve long-term prediction stability, intermediate interpolation, and fine-grained refinement, respectively. Control actions are derived within the embedding space, removing the need for state reconstruction.

Orthogonally, projection-based low-rank optimizers were mainly designed for memory efficiency, but remain suboptimal for communication-limited training: one-sided synchronization still transmits an $O(rn)$ object for an $m\\times n$ matrix gradient and refresh steps can dominate peak communicated bytes. We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

Recent work suggests that circuit-level brain alterations manifest as changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectral features detectable by machine learning. However, conventional deep learning approaches for EEG-based AD detection are computationally intensive and mechanistically opaque. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and energy-efficient alternative, yet their application to AD diagnosis remains largely unexplored.\n  We propose a neuro-bridge framework that links data-driven learning with minimal, biophysically grounded simulations, enabling bidirectional interpretation between machine learning signatures and circuit-level mechanisms in AD. Using resting-state clinical EEG, we train an SNN classifier that achieves competitive performance (AUC = 0.839) and identifies the aperiodic 1/f slope as a key discriminative marker.\n  The 1/f slope reflects excitation-inhibition balance. To interpret this mechanistically, we construct spiking network simulations in which inhibitory-to-excitatory synaptic ratios are systematically varied to emulate healthy, mild cognitive impairment, and AD-like states. Using both membrane potential-based and synaptic current-based EEG proxies, we reproduce empirical spectral slowing and altered alpha organization.\n  Incorporating empirical functional connectivity priors into multi-subnetwork simulations further enhances spectral differentiation, demonstrating that large-scale network topology constrains EEG signatures more strongly than excitation-inhibition balance alone. Overall, this neuro-bridge approach connects SNN-based classification with interpretable circuit simulations, advancing mechanistic understanding of EEG biomarkers while enabling scalable, explainable AD detection."}

Our formulation renders possible to express a rich family of operators over generative models densities, including intersection (e.g., to enforce safety), union (e.g., to compose diverse models), interpolation (e.g., for discovery), their reward-guided counterparts, as well as complex logical expressions via generative circuits.

To establish this, we build on the result that different EM finetunes converge to the same linear representation of general misalignment, which can be used to mediate misaligned behaviour. We find a linear representation of the narrow solution also exists, and can be learned by introducing a KL divergence loss. Comparing these representations reveals that general misalignment achieves lower loss, is more robust to perturbations, and is more influential in the pre-training distribution.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency.

We argue that this tax primarily arises from continual-learning-style forgetting in sequential alignment, where distribution shift and conflicting objectives cause safety updates to overwrite pre-trained competencies. Accordingly, we cast safety alignment as a continual learning (CL) problem that must balance plasticity (acquiring safety constraints) and stability (preserving general abilities). We propose Orthogonal Gradient Projection for Safety Alignment (OGPSA), a lightweight method that mitigates interference by constraining each safety update to be orthogonal (in a first-order sense) to a learned subspace capturing general capabilities. Specifically, OGPSA estimates a low-rank capability subspace from gradients on a small reference set and projects the safety gradient onto its orthogonal complement before updating. This produces safety-directed updates that minimally perturb prior knowledge while retaining capacity for alignment. OGPSA is plug-and-play and integrates into standard post-training pipelines without large-scale replay, auxiliary objectives, or retraining. Across Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and sequential SFT$\\rightarrow$DPO settings, OGPSA consistently improves the safety--utility Pareto frontier over standard baselines.

Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, qualitative analysis reveals that the generation trajectories of our model exhibit distinct behaviors in cases characterized by high noise or significant physiological variability, thereby offering a novel layer of interpretability for AI-aided diagnosis."}

We prove that the MAP estimator of SCoRa is well-behaved. It verifies monotonicity and robustness guarantees. We then empirically show that SCoRa recovers accurate scores, even under model mismatch. Most interestingly, we identify a realistic setting where combining comparisons and ratings outperforms using either one alone, and when the accurate ordering of top entities is critical. Given the de facto availability of signals of multiple forms, SCoRa additionally offers a versatile foundation for preference learning."}

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems."}

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and GID5 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach."}

Based on this idea, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation (TAAM). The key component of TAAM is its lightweight Neural Synapse Modulators (NSMs). For each new task, a dedicated NSM is trained and then frozen, acting as an \"expert module.\" These modules perform detailed, node-attentive adaptive modulation on the computational flow of a shared GNN backbone. This setup ensures that new knowledge is kept within compact, task-specific modules, naturally preventing catastrophic forgetting without using any data replay. Additionally, to address the important challenge of unknown task IDs in real-world scenarios, we propose and theoretically prove a novel method named Anchored Multi-hop Propagation (AMP). Notably, we find that existing GCL benchmarks have flaws that can cause data leakage and biased evaluations. Therefore, we conduct all experiments in a more rigorous inductive learning scenario.

The objective of this study is to evaluate how AI can enhance these techniques to ensure robust data protection while facilitating fair algorithmic management.

These findings highlight a crucial research gap in the intersection of AI, cyber laws, and environmental regulation, particularly in terms of addressing algorithmic bias, transparency, and accountability. The implications of this research underscore the need for stricter cyber laws. Also, the development of comprehensive regulations to safeguard sensitive environmental data.

To break this cycle, we propose Free()LM, a model that introduces an intrinsic self-forgetting capability via the Free-Module, a plug-and-play LoRA adapter. By iteratively switching between reasoning and cleaning modes, Free()LM dynamically identifies and prunes useless context chunks, maintaining a compact and noise-free state.\n  Extensive experiments show that Free()LM provides consistent improvements across all model scales (8B to 685B). It achieves a 3.3% average improvement over top-tier reasoning baselines, even establishing a new SOTA on IMOanswerBench using DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale. Most notably, in long-horizon tasks where the standard Qwen3-235B-A22B model suffers a total collapse (0% accuracy), Free()LM restores performance to 50%.

We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN).

To explore this, we select a financial stock market scenario to test behavioral consistency. Investors are typically classified as fundamental or technical traders, but most simulations fix strategies at initialization, failing to reflect real-world trading dynamics. In this work, we assess whether agents' strategy switching aligns with financial theory, providing a framework for this evaluation. We operationalize four behavioral-finance drivers-loss aversion, herding, wealth differentiation, and price misalignment-as personality traits set via prompting and stored long-term. In year-long simulations, agents process daily price-volume data, trade under a designated style, and reassess their strategy every 10 trading days. We introduce four alignment metrics and use Mann-Whitney U tests to compare agents' style-switching behavior with financial theory. Our results show that recent LLMs' switching behavior is only partially consistent with behavioral-finance theories, highlighting the need for further refinement in aligning agent behavior with financial theory."}

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection.

In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy.

Although existing approaches address imbalance through resampling or cost-sensitive learning during training, they require retraining or access to labeled target data when class distributions shift at deployment time, a common occurrence in real-world applications such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection. We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and medical diagnosis benchmarks under simulated deployment shifts demonstrate that OBIL maintains robust performance under severe distribution shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in F1 Score when test distributions deviate significantly from the training conditions."}

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning."}

However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines.

We learn a feasibility value function derived from an epigraph reformulation of the optimal control problem, thereby avoiding the decoupled objectives or post-hoc filtering common in prior work. Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling.

Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

Current systems force designers to choose between performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\n  To address these challenges, we present BAGEL (Bootstrap AGgregated Ensemble Layer), a modular, lightweight, and incrementally updatable framework for malicious prompt detection. BAGEL employs a bootstrap aggregation and mixture of expert inspired ensemble of fine-tuned models, each specialized on a different attack dataset. At inference, BAGEL uses a random forest router to identify the most suitable ensemble member, then applies stochastic selection to sample additional members for prediction aggregation. When new attacks emerge, BAGEL updates incrementally by fine-tuning a small prompt-safety classifier (86M parameters) and adding the resulting model to the ensemble. BAGEL achieves an F1 score of 0.92 by selecting just 5 ensemble members (430M parameters), outperforming OpenAI Moderation API and ShieldGemma which require billions of parameters. Performance remains robust after nine incremental updates, and BAGEL provides interpretability through its router's structural features.

The discussion focuses on two domains in which this is particularly visible: competitive basic research funding and large EU consortium projects.

The rapid development of intelligent tools, especially large language models (LLMs) with powerful knowledge reserves and interactive capabilities, has provided new paradigms for it. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenge for LLMs lies in the complex implicit relationship between molecular structure and pharmacological properties and the lack of corresponding labeled data. To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery. Our code and model checkpoints are open-sourced to foster future research."}

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147. LG-Tok-mini uses only half the tokens while maintaining competitive performance (Top-1: 0.521/0.588, FID: 0.085/0.071), validating the efficiency of our semantic representations."}

Prior attempts to combine their strengths typically lead to a stability-performance trade-off. We attribute this phenomenon to a structural incompatibility within a single-stream design: Any application of the Post-Norm operation inevitably obstructs the clean identity gradient preserved by Pre-Norm. To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning."}

Existing bandit-based methods treat time merely as a timestamp, neglecting its explicit relationship with user preferences and leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, online learning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration-exploitation during the early online phase. To address these issues, we propose HyperBandit+, a novel contextual bandit policy that integrates a time-aware hypernetwork to adapt to time-varying user preferences and employs a large language model-assisted warm-start mechanism (LLM Start) to enhance exploration-exploitation efficiency in the early online phase. Specifically, HyperBandit+ leverages a neural network that takes time features as input and generates parameters for estimating time-varying rewards by capturing the correlation between time and user preferences. Additionally, the LLM Start mechanism employs multi-step data augmentation to simulate realistic interaction data for effective offline learning, providing warm-start parameters for the bandit policy in the early online phase. To meet real-time streaming recommendation demands, we adopt low-rank factorization to reduce hypernetwork training complexity. Theoretically, we rigorously establish a sublinear regret upper bound that accounts for both the hypernetwork and the LLM warm-start mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperBandit+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accumulated rewards."}

Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing. However, this paradigm introduces significant challenges as diverse errors may occur during reasoning processes. This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and establish crucial foundations for advancing PRMs in LVLMs."}

In Alzheimers disease (AD), multimodal neuroimaging offers complementary signals but VAE-based normative models often (i) fit the healthy reference distribution imperfectly, inflating false positives, and (ii) use posterior aggregation (e.g., PoE/MoE) that can yield weak multimodal fusion in the shared latent space. We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data."}

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions."}

We propose MTSCSNet, a CS framework based on Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) factorization, a structured operator for efficient multidimensional signal processing. MTS performs mode-wise linear transformations with multiscale summation, enabling large receptive fields and effective modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. In MTSCSNet, MTS is first used as a learnable CS operator that performs linear dimensionality reduction in tensor space, with its adjoint defining the initial back-projection, and is then applied in the reconstruction stage to directly refine this estimate. This results in a simple feed-forward architecture without iterative or proximal optimization, while remaining parameter and computation efficient. Experiments on standard CS benchmarks show that MTSCSNet achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on RGB images, with notable PSNR gains and faster inference, even compared to recent diffusion-based CS methods, while using a significantly more compact feed-forward architecture."}

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

In practice, domain knowledge evolves continuously through new regulations, products, services, and interaction patterns. Retraining or fine-tuning LLMs for every new instance is computationally infeasible. Additionally, real-world environments also exhibit temporal dynamics with shifting data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics. It yields an absolute ROUGE-L gain of 0.065 and a 13.6% relative improvement in Cosine Similarity over the best baseline.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off. Our results demonstrate that FADE achieves strong concept erasure and high retainability across various domains, making it a suitable solution for selective unlearning in diffusion-based image generation models."}

We adopt a simple philosophical view, robust reasoning should remain useful beyond the mind that produced it, and treat reasoning as a form of meaning transfer that must survive truncation, reinterpretation, and continuation. Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps. For example, on MATH500, RLTR achieves a +3.6%p gain in Maj@64 compared to RLVR and matches RLVR's average accuracy with roughly 2.5x fewer training steps, providing both more reliable reasoning and significantly more sample efficient."}

This repurposes neural MI estimators for dimensionality estimation. We show that standard neural estimators with separable/bilinear critics systematically inflate the inferred dimension, and we address this by introducing a hybrid critic that retains an explicit dimensional bottleneck while allowing flexible nonlinear cross-view interactions, thereby preserving the latent geometry. We further propose a one-shot protocol that reads off the effective dimension from a single over-parameterized hybrid model, without sweeping over bottleneck sizes. We validate the approach on synthetic problems with known task-relevant dimension. We extend the approach to intrinsic dimensionality by constructing paired views of a single dataset, enabling comparison with classical geometric dimension estimators. In noisy regimes where those estimators degrade, our approach remains reliable. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the method on multiple physics datasets."}

In this paper, we study the reproducibility practices in papers published in the Evolutionary Combinatorial Optimization and Metaheuristics track of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference over a ten-year period.

This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability. Across 7 benchmarks, it achieves SoTA performance among open-source VLMs, outperforming the best RLVR baseline by 1.0 score while requiring only $0.72\\times$ training time per step."}

We present \\textit{Online Bayesian Imbalanced Learning} (OBIL), a principled framework that decouples likelihood-ratio estimation from class-prior assumptions, enabling real-time adaptation to distribution shifts without model retraining. Our approach builds on the established connection between Bregman divergences and proper scoring rules to show that deep networks trained with such losses produce posterior probability estimates from which prior-invariant likelihood ratios can be extracted. We prove that these likelihood-ratio estimates remain valid under arbitrary changes in class priors and cost structures, requiring only a threshold adjustment for optimal Bayes decisions. We derive finite-sample regret bounds demonstrating that OBIL achieves $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ regret against an oracle with perfect prior knowledge.

Key results on 1 million synthetic maze pairs include:\n  - 192x reduction in training loss over 100 epochs\n  - 22.7x improvement in L2 distance to ground truth\n  - Only 10 Euler steps required (vs. 100-1000 for typical diffusion models)\n  Quantitative analysis reveals a striking phase transition phenomenon: the solution remains invisible for 68% of the transformation (zero recall), then emerges abruptly at t=0.70 within just 2% of the process.

In practice, missing packages, fragile file paths, version conflicts, or incomplete logic frequently cause analyses to fail, even when materials are shared. This study investigates whether large language models and AI agents can automate the diagnosis and repair of such failures, making computational results easier to reproduce and verify. We evaluate this using a controlled reproducibility testbed built from five fully reproducible R-based social science studies. Realistic failures were injected, ranging from simple issues to complex missing logic, and two automated repair workflows were tested in clean Docker environments. The first workflow is prompt-based, repeatedly querying language models with structured prompts of varying context, while the second uses agent-based systems that inspect files, modify code, and rerun analyses autonomously. Across prompt-based runs, reproduction success ranged from 31-79 percent, with performance strongly influenced by prompt context and error complexity. Complex cases benefited most from additional context. Agent-based workflows performed substantially better, with success rates of 69-96 percent across all complexity levels. These results suggest that automated workflows, especially agent-based systems, can significantly reduce manual effort and improve reproduction success across diverse error types. Unlike prior benchmarks, our testbed isolates post-publication repair under controlled failure modes, allowing direct comparison of prompt-based and agent-based approaches."}

A common approach is to use predictive distributions from Bayesian or approximation methods and additively decompose uncertainty into aleatoric (i.e., data-related) and epistemic (i.e., model-related) components. However, additive decomposition has recently been questioned, with evidence that it breaks down when using finite-ensemble sampling and/or mismatched predictive distributions. This paper introduces Variance-Gated Ensembles (VGE), an intuitive, differentiable framework that injects epistemic sensitivity via a signal-to-noise gate computed from ensemble statistics. VGE provides: (i) a Variance-Gated Margin Uncertainty (VGMU) score that couples decision margins with ensemble predictive variance; and (ii) a Variance-Gated Normalization (VGN) layer that generalizes the variance-gated uncertainty mechanism to training via per-class, learnable normalization of ensemble member probabilities. We derive closed-form vector-Jacobian products enabling end-to-end training through ensemble sample mean and variance. VGE matches or exceeds state-of-the-art information-theoretic baselines while remaining computationally efficient. As a result, VGE provides a practical and scalable approach to epistemic-aware uncertainty estimation in ensemble models.

As these models see increasing real-world deployment, ensuring their reliability and responsibility has become critical for academia, industry, and government. This survey addresses the reliable and responsible development of foundation models. We explore critical issues, including bias and fairness, security and privacy, uncertainty, explainability, and distribution shift. Our research also covers model limitations, such as hallucinations, as well as methods like alignment and Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) detection.

Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis. As a result, memorization and copying have been conflated across both technical and legal communities and in multiple contexts. We argue that memorization, as commonly studied in data science, should not be equated with copying and should not be used as a proxy for copyright infringement. We distinguish technical signals that meaningfully indicate infringement risk from those that instead reflect lawful generalization or high-frequency content.

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation. Extensive experimental results validate that TriC-Motion achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, attaining an outstanding R@1 of 0.612 on the HumanML3D dataset. These results demonstrate its capability to generate high-fidelity, coherent, diverse, and text-aligned motion sequences. Code is available at: https://caoyiyang1105.github.io/TriC-Motion/."}

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps. Extensive experiments on real-world SR benchmarks demonstrate that Bird-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality while preserving structural consistency, validating its effectiveness for real-world super-resolution."}

Centroid distance in the low-dimensional subspace matches trained probe performance (0.90 AUC), enabling few-shot detection: on GPT-2, 25 labeled examples achieve 89% of full-data accuracy.

We study two representative paradigms (i.e., Coconut and CODI) on both mathematical and general reasoning tasks to investigate three key questions: (1) which steps are causally necessary for correctness and when answers become decidable early; (2) how does influence propagate across steps, and how does this structure compare to explicit CoT; and (3) do intermediate trajectories retain competing answer modes, and how does output-level commitment differ from representational commitment across steps. We find that latent-step budgets behave less like homogeneous extra depth and more like staged functionality with non-local routing, and we identify a persistent gap between early output bias and late representational commitment. These results motivate mode-conditional and stability-aware analyses -- and corresponding training/decoding objectives -- as more reliable tools for interpreting and improving latent reasoning systems."}

This raises concerns about representation collapse and degradation of open-ended generation capabilities. In this work, we explore Spherical Steering, a training-free primitive that resolves this trade-off through activation rotation. Rather than shifting activations with a fixed vector, our method rotates them along a geodesic toward a target direction, guiding the activation toward the target concept while preserving the integrity of the signal. To further enhance adaptivity, we incorporate a confidence gate that dynamically modulates steering strength based on input uncertainty. Extensive experiments across multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that Spherical Steering significantly outperforms addition-based baselines (notably by +10% on TruthfulQA, COPA, and Storycloze), while simultaneously maintaining the model's general open-ended generation quality.

A critical question is whether statistically detectable heterogeneity translates into improved treatment decisions -- these are distinct questions that can yield contradictory answers. We present a modular causal machine learning framework that evaluates each question separately: permutation importance identifies which features predict heterogeneity, best linear predictor (BLP) testing assesses statistical significance, and doubly robust policy evaluation measures whether acting on the heterogeneity improves patient outcomes. We apply this framework to patient-level data from the UNIFI maintenance trial of ustekinumab in ulcerative colitis, comparing placebo, standard-dose ustekinumab every 12 weeks, and dose-intensified ustekinumab every 8 weeks, using cross-fitted X-learner models with baseline demographics, medication history, week-8 clinical scores, laboratory biomarkers, and video-derived endoscopic features. BLP testing identified strong associations between endoscopic features and treatment effect heterogeneity for ustekinumab versus placebo, yet doubly robust policy evaluation showed no improvement in expected remission from incorporating endoscopic features, and out-of-fold multi-arm evaluation showed worse performance. Diagnostic comparison of prognostic contribution against policy value revealed that endoscopic scores behaved as disease severity markers -- improving outcome prediction in untreated patients but adding noise to treatment selection -- while clinical variables (fecal calprotectin, age, CRP) captured the decision-relevant variation. These results demonstrate that causal machine learning applications to clinical trials should include policy-level evaluation alongside heterogeneity testing."}

We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization."}

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms."}

While fractional Brownian motion has been widely used as a noise source to capture such memory effects, its incompatibility with Itô calculus limits its applicability in neural stochastic differential equation~(SDE) frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel class of noise, termed Neural Network-kernel ARMA-type noise~(NA-noise), which is an Itô-process-based alternative capable of capturing both long- and short-memory behaviors. The kernel function defining the noise structure is parameterized via neural networks and decomposed into a product form to preserve the Markov property. Based on this noise process, we develop NANSDE-Net, a generative model that extends Neural SDEs by incorporating NA-noise. We prove the theoretical existence and uniqueness of the solution under mild conditions and derive an efficient backpropagation scheme for training. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NANSDE-Net matches or outperforms existing models, including fractional SDE-Net, in reproducing long- and short-memory features of the data, while maintaining computational tractability within the Itô calculus framework."}

However, these methods assign uniform weights to all selected heads, implicitly assuming that each head contributes equally across all semantic categories. In this work, we propose Class-Conditional Sparse Attention Vectors for Large Audio-Language Models, a few-shot classification method that learns class-dependent importance weights over attention heads. This formulation allows individual heads to specialize in distinct semantic categories and to contribute to ensemble predictions proportionally to their estimated reliability. Experiments on multiple few-shot audio and audiovisual classification benchmarks and tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art uniform voting-based approaches by up to 14.52%, 1.53%, 8.35% absolute gains for audio classification, audio-visual classification, and spoofing detection respectively."}

To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression.

Although classic optimal baseline theory can achieve global variance reduction, it neglects token heterogeneity and requires prohibitive gradient-based computation. In this work, we derive the Optimal Token Baseline (OTB) from first principles, proving that gradient updates should be weighted inversely to their cumulative gradient norm. To ensure efficiency, we propose the Logit-Gradient Proxy that approximates the gradient norm using only forward-pass probabilities.

The controller consumes full-trace confidence to decide whether to halt, re-examine, or try a different approach, enabling targeted self-correction with an average of 2.7 refinement steps per problem and roughly 190-fold token reduction relative to 512-sample baselines. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and three open-source models, the controller achieves 92.6 percent precision when it confidently halts, indicating that confidence dynamics reliably signal correctness without ground-truth verification. We extend this to CoRefine-Tree, a hybrid sequential-parallel variant that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, with easy serving integration and verifier compatibility. By treating confidence as a control signal rather than a correctness guarantee, CoRefine provides a modular primitive for scalable reasoning and agentic settings with imperfect verifiers."}

As such data often co-evolves with multiple variables interacting with each other, estimating the time-varying dependencies between variables (i.e., the dynamic network structure) has become crucial for accurate modeling. However, real-world data is often represented as tensor time series with multiple modes, resulting in large, entangled networks that are hard to interpret and computationally intensive to estimate. In this paper, we propose Kronecker Time-Varying Graphical Lasso (KTVGL), a method designed for modeling tensor time series. Our approach estimates mode-specific dynamic networks in a Kronecker product form, thereby avoiding overly complex entangled structures and producing interpretable modeling results. Moreover, the partitioned network structure prevents the exponential growth of computational time with data dimension. In addition, our method can be extended to stream algorithms, making the computational time independent of the sequence length. Experiments on synthetic data show that the proposed method achieves higher edge estimation accuracy than existing methods while requiring less computation time.

This raises a fundamental, yet unexplored question: Can an LLM's functional correctness be assessed purely from its internal computational structure? Our primary objective is to investigate whether the model's neural dynamics encode internally decodable signals that are predictive of logical validity during code generation. Inspired by mechanistic interpretability, we propose to treat code verification as a mechanistic diagnostic task, mapping the model's explicit algorithmic trajectory into line-level attribution graphs. By decomposing complex residual flows, we aim to identify the structural signatures that distinguish sound reasoning from logical failure within the model's internal circuits. Analysis across Python, C++, and Java confirms that intrinsic correctness signals are robust across diverse syntaxes. Topological features from these internal graphs predict correctness more reliably than surface heuristics and enable targeted causal interventions to fix erroneous logic. These findings establish internal introspection as a decodable property for verifying generated code. Our code is at https:// github.com/bruno686/CodeCircuit."}

Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches. We further incorporate keypoint confidence scores from SuperPoint into a confidence-weighted factor graph to improve estimation robustness.

We dissect this mismatch into two deficiencies: Decoder-Blindness (being oblivious to the non-differentiable decoding process) and Cost-Blindness (prioritizing structural imitation over solution quality). We empirically demonstrate that these intrinsic flaws impose a hard performance ceiling. To overcome this limitation, we propose CADO (Cost-Aware Diffusion models for Optimization), a streamlined Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning framework that formulates the diffusion denoising process as an MDP to directly optimize the post-decoded solution cost. We introduce Label-Centered Reward, which repurposes ground-truth labels as unbiased baselines rather than imitation targets, and Hybrid Fine-Tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation.

A key challenge in this setting arises from the lack of semantic alignment between prompt instructions that encode similar distributional patterns of missing data across different clients. To address this, our framework introduces specialized client-tuning and server-aggregation designs that simultaneously optimize, align, and aggregate prompt-tuning instructions across clients and data modalities. This allows prompt instructions to complement one another and be combined effectively.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods."}

The paradox of de-identification is further shown through a diagnosis ablation: even when all other information is removed, the model can predict the patient's neighborhood based on diagnosis alone.

To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios.

A framework for physics-consistent automatic building modeling is therefore proposed, integrating domain knowledge construction, constraint-oriented model alignment, and verification-driven evaluation. CivilInstruct is introduced as a domain-specific dataset that formalizes structural engineering knowledge and constraint reasoning to enable simulation-ready model generation. A two-stage fine-tuning strategy is further employed to enforce constraint satisfaction and application programming interface compliance, substantially reducing hallucinated and non-conforming outputs. MBEval is presented as a verification-driven benchmark that evaluates executability and structural dynamics consistency through closed-loop validation. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baselines across rigorous verification metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jovanqing/AutoBM."}

Current LLM research is dominated by a paradigm that relies heavily on unidirectional scaling of data size, increasingly encountering bottlenecks in data availability, acquisition cost, and training efficiency. In this work, we argue that the development of AGI is entering a new phase of data-model co-evolution, in which models actively guide data management while high-quality data, in turn, amplifies model capabilities. To implement this vision, we propose a tiered data management framework, designed to support the full LLM training lifecycle across heterogeneous learning objectives and cost constraints. Specifically, we introduce an L0-L4 tiered data management framework, ranging from raw uncurated resources to organized and verifiable knowledge. Importantly, LLMs are fully used in data management processes, such as quality scoring and content editing, to refine data across tiers. Each tier is characterized by distinct data properties, management strategies, and training roles, enabling data to be strategically allocated across LLM training stages, including pre-training, mid-training, and alignment. The framework balances data quality, acquisition cost, and marginal training benefit, providing a systematic approach to scalable and sustainable data management. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through empirical studies, in which tiered datasets are constructed from raw corpora and used across multiple training phases. Experimental results demonstrate that tier-aware data utilization significantly improves training efficiency and model performance. To facilitate further research, we release our tiered datasets and processing tools to the community."}

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods."}

By mapping information states to a Riemannian manifold with the Fisher information metric, we derive the intelligence Lagrangian. We show that the softmax function corresponds to the unique thermodynamic equilibrium state that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy of the information gas. In addition, we identify the query-key interaction as an electrodynamic coupling between an external field and an intrinsic dipole moment. This theory establishes the first law of information thermodynamics, unifying inference (mechanical work) and learning (chemical evolution). It also explains emergent phenomena, such as scaling laws and grokking, as phase transitions characterized by the divergence of specific heat.

To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation.

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of three retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) variants [Lewis et al., 2021] -- standard RAG, Self-RAG [Asai et al., 2024], and CoRAG [Wang et al., 2025] -- across SQL query generation, REST API call generation, and a combined task requiring dynamic task classification. Using SAP Transactional Banking as a realistic enterprise use case, we construct a novel test dataset covering both modalities and evaluate 18 experimental configurations under database-only, API-only, and hybrid documentation contexts. Results demonstrate that RAG is essential: Without retrieval, exact match accuracy is 0% across all tasks, whereas retrieval yields substantial gains in execution accuracy (up to 79.30%) and component match accuracy (up to 78.86%). Critically, CoRAG proves most robust in hybrid documentation settings, achieving statistically significant improvements in the combined task (10.29% exact match vs. 7.45% for standard RAG), driven primarily by superior SQL generation performance (15.32% vs. 11.56%).

Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs."}

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new learning paradigm, In-Context Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (ICPRL), in which both pretraining and deployment rely solely on preference feedback, eliminating the need for reward supervision. We study two variants that differ in the granularity of feedback: Immediate Preference-based RL (I-PRL) with per-step preferences, and Trajectory Preference-based RL (T-PRL) with trajectory-level comparisons. We first show that supervised pretraining, a standard approach in ICRL, remains effective under preference-only context datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of in-context reinforcement learning using only preference signals. To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision."}

Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy.

To address these challenges, we propose PRO-Bid, a constraint-aware generative auto-bidding framework based on two synergistic mechanisms: 1) Constraint-Decoupled Pareto Representation (CDPR) decomposes global constraints into recursive cost and value contexts to restore resource perception, while reweighting trajectories based on the Pareto frontier to focus on high-efficiency data; and 2) Counterfactual Regret Optimization (CRO) facilitates active improvement by utilizing a global outcome predictor to identify superior counterfactual actions.

Based on these observations, Lemon Agent is introduced, a multi-agent orchestrator-worker system built on a newly proposed AgentCortex framework, which formalizes the classic Planner-Executor-Memory paradigm through an adaptive task execution mechanism. Our system integrates a hierarchical self-adaptive scheduling mechanism that operates at both the overall orchestrator layer and workers layer. This mechanism can dynamically adjust computational intensity based on task complexity. It enables orchestrator to allocate one or more workers for parallel subtask execution, while workers can further improve operational efficiency by invoking tools concurrently. By virtue of this two-tier architecture, the system achieves synergistic balance between global task coordination and local task execution, thereby optimizing resource utilization and task processing efficiency in complex scenarios. To reduce context redundancy and increase information density during parallel steps, we adopt a three-tier progressive context management strategy. To make fuller use of historical information, we propose a self-evolving memory system, which can extract multi-dimensional valid information from all historical experiences to assist in completing similar tasks. Furthermore, we provide an enhanced MCP toolset. Empirical evaluations on authoritative benchmarks demonstrate that our Lemon Agent can achieve a state-of-the-art 91.36% overall accuracy on GAIA and secures the top position on the xbench-DeepSearch leaderboard with a score of 77+."}

While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

Based on this, we evaluate models under three formulations that test answering, recognizing missing information, and rejecting unjustified options, and find consistent performance drops when key conditions are absent. General-purpose models tend to over-commit and guess, while most finance-specialized models fail to clearly identify missing premises. These results highlight a critical gap in current evaluations and show that reliable financial models must know when a question should not be answered."}

A common metric for this, inspired by Boolean function analysis, is average sensitivity, which captures a model's robustness to single-token perturbations. We argue that average sensitivity has two key limitations: it lacks a natural generalization to real-valued domains and fails to explain the \"junta-like\" input dependence we empirically observe in modern LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose noise stability as a more comprehensive simplicity metric. Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively. Our results sculpt a new connection between signal propagation in neural networks and interpretability, with noise stability emerging as a powerful tool for understanding and improving modern Transformers."}

We present scDFM, a generative framework based on conditional flow matching that models the full distribution of perturbed cells conditioned on control states. By incorporating a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) objective, our method aligns perturbed and control populations beyond cell-level correspondences. To further improve robustness to sparsity and noise, we introduce the Perturbation-Aware Differential Transformer (PAD-Transformer), a backbone architecture that leverages gene interaction graphs and differential attention to capture context-specific expression changes.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data.

We study grokking in one of the simplest possible settings: the learning of a linear model with logistic loss for binary classification on data that are linearly (and max margin) separable about the origin. We investigate three testing regimes: (1) test data drawn from the same distribution as the training data, in which case grokking is not observed; (2) test data concentrated around the margin, in which case grokking is observed; and (3) adversarial test data generated via projected gradient descent (PGD) attacks, in which case grokking is also observed. We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term."}

While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible.

The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones.

While prior work on IGL provides efficient algorithms with provable guarantees, those results are confined to single-step settings, restricting their applicability to modern sequential decision-making systems such as multi-turn Large Language Model (LLM) deployments. To bridge this gap, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm that achieves a sublinear regret guarantee for contextual episodic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with personalized feedback. Technically, we extend the reward-estimator construction of Zhang et al. [2024a] from the single-step to the multi-step setting, addressing the unique challenges of decoding latent rewards under MDPs. Building on this estimator, we design an Inverse-Gap-Weighting (IGW) algorithm for policy optimization.

Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only. This methodology enhances the interpretability of multimodal training and provides a foundation for understanding and refining how pretrained language models acquire vision-grounded capabilities."}

The proposed test leverages the high computational efficiency of flow matching and requires the model to be trained only once throughout the entire causal discovery procedure, substantially accelerating causal discovery. According to numerical experiments, FMCIT effectively controls type-I error and maintains high testing power under the alternative hypothesis, even in the presence of high-dimensional conditioning sets.

We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.

To achieve high-fidelity, fast reasoning, we propose a novel EXTreme-RAtio Chain-of-Thought Compression framework, termed Extra-CoT, which aggressively reduces the token budget while preserving answer accuracy. To generate reliable, high-fidelity supervision, we first train a dedicated semantically-preserved compressor on mathematical CoT data with fine-grained annotations. An LLM is then fine-tuned on these compressed pairs via a mixed-ratio supervised fine-tuning (SFT), teaching it to follow a spectrum of compression budgets and providing a stable initialization for reinforcement learning (RL). We further propose Constrained and Hierarchical Ratio Policy Optimization (CHRPO) to explicitly incentivize question-solving ability under lower budgets by a hierarchical reward. Experiments on three mathematical reasoning benchmarks show the superiority of Extra-CoT. For example, on MATH-500 using Qwen3-1.7B, Extra-CoT achieves over 73\\% token reduction with an accuracy improvement of 0.6\\%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods."}

They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation."}

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline."}

First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results.

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks.

In many applications, the parameters being tuned come with a carefully engineered default configuration, and practitioners only want to deviate from this default when necessary. Standard BO, however, does not aim to minimize deviation from the default and, in practice, often pushes weakly relevant parameters to the boundary of the search space. This makes it difficult to distinguish between important and spurious changes and increases the burden of vetting recommendations when the optimization objective omits relevant operational considerations. We introduce BONSAI, a default-aware BO policy that prunes low-impact deviations from a default configuration while explicitly controlling the loss in acquisition value. BONSAI is compatible with a variety of acquisition functions, including expected improvement and upper confidence bound (GP-UCB). We theoretically bound the regret incurred by BONSAI, showing that, under certain conditions, it enjoys the same no-regret property as vanilla GP-UCB. Across many real-world applications, we empirically find that BONSAI substantially reduces the number of non-default parameters in recommended configurations while maintaining competitive optimization performance, with little effect on wall time."}

We test this assumption by collecting 60,000 agentic trajectories on SWE-Bench-Verified, spanning three models and two scaffolds. We find substantial variance: single-run pass@1 estimates vary by 2.2 to 6.0 percentage points depending on which run is selected, with standard deviations exceeding 1.5 percentage points even at temperature 0. This variance has critical implications: reported improvements of 2--3 percentage points may reflect evaluation noise rather than genuine algorithmic progress. Through token-level analysis, we show that trajectories diverge early, often within the first few percent of tokens, and that these small differences cascade into different solution strategies. To enable reliable evaluation of agentic systems, we recommend three concrete practices: (1) estimate pass@1 from multiple independent runs per task, especially when measuring small improvements, (2) use statistical power analysis to determine the number of runs needed to detect expected effect sizes, and (3) consider metrics like pass@k (optimistic bound) and pass^k (pessimistic bound) with k>1 to better characterize the full performance envelope.

We propose a matching framework that selects samples relative to an adaptive centroid and iteratively refines the representation distribution. The double robustness and the propensity score matching for the inclusion of data domains make matching more robust than naive pooling and uniform subsampling by filtering out the confounding domains (the main cause of heterogeneity). Theoretical and empirical analyses show that, unlike naive pooling or uniform subsampling, matching achieves better results under asymmetric meta-distributions, which are also extended to non-Gaussian and multimodal real-world settings. Most importantly, we show that these improvements translate to zero-shot medical anomaly detection, one of the extreme forms of data heterogeneity and asymmetry.

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA"}

We introduce JoBS, an approach that uses a scaling-law-inspired performance predictor to aid Bayesian optimization (BO) in jointly optimizing LLM training data and model configurations efficiently. JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs. We study JoBS's average regret and devise the optimal budget allocation to minimize regret. JoBS outperforms existing multi-fidelity BO baselines, as well as data and model optimization approaches across diverse LLM tasks under the same optimization budget."}

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities."}

Specifically, we focus on two representative curved losses: linear regression and logistic regression. Our method not only simplifies existing proofs for the optimal dynamic regret of online linear regression, but also yields new dynamic regret guarantees for online logistic regression. Beyond online convex optimization, we apply the reduction to analyze the Adam optimizers, obtaining optimal convergence rates in stochastic, non-convex, and non-smooth settings. The reduction also enables a more detailed treatment of Adam with two discount parameters $(β_1,β_2)$, leading to new results for both clipped and clip-free variants of Adam optimizers."}

We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach promotes edit disentanglement and locality while preserving global output coherence, enabling single-pass, instance-level editing."}

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient. Our findings suggest that diverse human-like behaviors are not merely induced in LLMs, but are already embedded in their parameter space, pointing toward a new perspective on controllable and interpretable personalization in large language models."}

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations."}

Across ten 2D and 3D benchmarks, RMN achieves 1.5$\\times$--51$\\times$ lower RMSE than MLPs and 10$\\times$--100$\\times$ lower RMSE than SIREN while using 27 parameters, compared with 33,537 for MLPs and 8,577 for SIREN. We extend RMN to angular dependence (RMN-Angular) and to multiple sources with learnable centers (RMN-MC); when optimization converges, source-center recovery errors fall below $10^{-4}$. We also report controlled failures on smooth, strongly non-radial targets to delineate RMN's operating regime."}

We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

Although recent works incorporate structural information, they implicitly condition adaptation on the smoothness priors of sourcetrained GNNs, thereby limiting their generalization to structurally distinct targets. This dependency becomes a critical bottleneck under significant topological shifts, where the source model misinterprets distinct topological patterns unseen in the source domain as noise, rendering pseudo-label-based adaptation unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Universal Structural Basis Distillation, a framework that shifts the paradigm from adapting a biased model to learning a universal structural basis for SF-GDA. Instead of adapting a biased source model to a specific target, our core idea is to construct a structure-agnostic basis that proactively covers the full spectrum of potential topological patterns. Specifically, USBD employs a bi-level optimization framework to distill the source dataset into a compact structural basis. By enforcing the prototypes to span the full Dirichlet energy spectrum, the learned basis explicitly captures diverse topological motifs, ranging from low-frequency clusters to high-frequency chains, beyond those present in the source. This ensures that the learned basis creates a comprehensive structural covering capable of handling targets with disparate structures. For inference, we introduce a spectral-aware ensemble mechanism that dynamically activates the optimal prototype combination based on the spectral fingerprint of the target graph. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that USBD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with severe structural shifts, while achieving superior computational efficiency by decoupling the adaptation cost from the target data scale."}

A particularly elegant way of interpreting SCMs is do-Shapley, a game-theoretic method of quantifying the average effect of $d$ variables across exponentially many interventions. Like Shapley values, computing do-Shapley values generally requires evaluating exponentially many terms. The foundation of our work is a reformulation of do-Shapley values in terms of the irreducible sets of the underlying SCM. Leveraging this insight, we can exactly compute do-Shapley values in time linear in the number of irreducible sets $r$, which itself can range from $d$ to $2^d$ depending on the graph structure of the SCM. Since $r$ is unknown a priori, we complement the exact algorithm with an estimator that, like general Shapley value estimators, can be run with any query budget. As the query budget approaches $r$, our estimators can produce more accurate estimates than prior methods by several orders of magnitude, and, when the budget reaches $r$, return the Shapley values up to machine precision. Beyond computational speed, we also reduce the identification burden: we prove that non-parametric identifiability of do-Shapley values requires only the identification of interventional effects for the $d$ singleton coalitions, rather than all classes."}

Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model.

These devices, typically relying on TinyML models, collaboratively train global models by sharing gradients with a central server while preserving data privacy. However, as data heterogeneity and task complexity increase, TinyML models often become insufficient to capture intricate patterns, especially under extreme non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) conditions. Moreover, ensuring robustness against malicious clients and poisoned updates remains a major challenge. Accordingly, this paper introduces RIFLE - a Robust, distillation-based Federated Learning framework that replaces gradient sharing with logit-based knowledge transfer. By leveraging a knowledge distillation aggregation scheme, RIFLE enables the training of deep models such as VGG-19 and Resnet18 within constrained IoT systems. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based validation mechanism quantifies the reliability of client updates without exposing raw data, achieving high trust and privacy preservation simultaneously. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) under heterogeneous non-IID conditions demonstrate that RIFLE reduces false-positive detections by up to 87.5%, enhances poisoning attack mitigation by 62.5%, and achieves up to 28.3% higher accuracy compared to conventional federated learning baselines within only 10 rounds.

The optimal loss sharpness for a user-item pair with a particular set of negatives, can be suboptimal or destabilising for another with different negatives. We introduce Dual-scale Softmax Loss (DSL), which infers effective sharpness from the sampled competition itself. DSL adds two complementary branches to the log-sum-exp backbone. Firstly it reweights negatives within each training instance using hardness and item--item similarity, secondly it adapts a per-example temperature from the competition intensity over a constructed competitor slate. Together, these components preserve the geometry of SL while reshaping the competition distribution across negatives and across examples.\n  Over several representative benchmarks and backbones, DSL yields substantial gains over strong baselines, with improvements over SL exceeding $10%$ in several settings and averaging $6.22%$ across datasets, metrics, and backbones. Under out-of-distribution (OOD) popularity shift, the gains are larger, with an average of $9.31%$ improvement over SL. We further provide a theoretical, distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) analysis, which demonstrates how DSL reshapes the robust payoff and the KL deviation for ambiguous instances.

A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames.

This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential. We provide density-aware strategies that improve training robustness and discuss architectural implications for systems that adaptively balance feed-forward prediction and rendering-based refinement."}

The architecture is deliberately minimal, consisting of one self-attention layer with a single query per prediction and one feedforward layer, resulting in linear computational complexity in sequence length and a small parameter count. Numerical experiments demonstrate that TD-TF matches the performance of strong linear baselines on near-linear systems, while significantly outperforming them in nonlinear and chaotic regimes, where it accurately captures long-term dynamics.

Intuitively, users with similar tasks must be able to assist each other in boosting the effective fine-tuning data size. We propose Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation, or CoLoRA, which exploits task similarity to collaboratively and efficiently fine-tune personalized foundation models. The main idea in CoLoRA is to train one shared adapter capturing underlying task similarities across all tasks, and personalized adapters tailored to user-specific tasks. We theoretically study CoLoRA on heterogeneous linear regression and provide provable guarantees for ground truth recovery. We also conduct several natural language experiments with varying task similarity, which further demonstrate that when trained together with similar tasks, individual performances are significantly boosted."}

Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse. Our approach achieves superior image quality and geometric accuracy compared to prior methods on multi-view timelapse datasets of plant growth, providing a new approach for appearance modeling of growing 3D structures."}

Building on this principle, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Transferable Reward (RLTR), which operationalizes robustness via transfer reward that tests whether a partial reasoning prefix from one model can guide a separate model to the correct answer. This encourages LLMs to produce reasoning that is stable, interpretable, and genuinely generalizable. Our approach improves sampling consistency while improving final answer accuracy, and it reaches comparable performance in substantially fewer training steps.

This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound. Experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in performance and training efficiency across multiple RLVR optimization methods."}

Existing watermarks insert a signal into generated tokens that either flags LM-generated text (zero-bit watermarking) or encodes more complex messages (multi-bit watermarking). Though a number of recent multi-bit watermarks insert several bits into text without perturbing average next-token predictions, they largely extend design principles from the zero-bit setting, such as encoding a single bit per token. Notably, the information-theoretic capacity of multi-bit watermarking -- the maximum number of bits per token that can be inserted and detected without changing average next-token predictions -- has remained unknown. We address this gap by deriving the first capacity characterization of multi-bit watermarks. Our results inform the design of ArcMark: a new watermark construction based on coding-theoretic principles that, under certain assumptions, achieves the capacity of the multi-bit watermark channel. In practice, ArcMark outperforms competing multi-bit watermarks in terms of bit rate per token and detection accuracy.

We study this assumption empirically by asking: when does meta-path attention reflect meta-path importance, and when can it decouple? A key challenge is that most post-hoc GNN explainers are designed for homogeneous graphs, and naive adaptations to heterogeneous neighborhoods can mix semantics and confound perturbations. To enable a controlled empirical analysis, we introduce MetaXplain, a meta-path-aware post-hoc explanation protocol that applies existing explainers in the native meta-path view domain via (i) view-factorized explanations, (ii) schema-valid channel-wise perturbations, and (iii) fusion-aware attribution, without modifying the underlying predictor. We benchmark representative gradient-, perturbation-, and Shapley-style explainers on ACM, DBLP, and IMDB with HAN and HAN-GCN, comparing against xPath and type-matched random baselines under standard faithfulness metrics. To quantify attention reliability, we propose Meta-Path Attention--Explanation Alignment (MP-AEA), which measures rank correlation between learned attention weights and explanation-derived meta-path contribution scores across random runs. Our results show that meta-path-aware explanations typically outperform random controls, while MP-AEA reveals both high-alignment and statistically significant decoupling regimes depending on the dataset and backbone; moreover, retraining on explanation-induced subgraphs often preserves, and in some noisy regimes improves, predictive performance, suggesting an explanation-as-denoising effect."}

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks such as Structure3D, CubiCasa5K, and Raster2Graph, while also demonstrating strong generalization to more challenging datasets like WAFFLE, which contain diverse room structures and complex geometric variations."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning. Beyond this case study, we analyze broader implications of implicit memory, including covert inter-agent communication, benchmark contamination, targeted manipulation, and training-data poisoning.

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

Model merging offers a compelling alternative by directly integrating the weights of multiple source models without requiring additional data or extensive training. However, conventional model merging techniques, such as parameter averaging, often suffer from the unintended combination of non-generalizable features, especially when source models exhibit significant weight disparities. Comparatively, model ensembling generally provides more stable and superior performance that aggregates multiple models by averaging outputs. However, it incurs higher inference costs and increased storage requirements. While previous studies experimentally showed the similarities between model merging and ensembling, theoretical evidence and evaluation metrics remain lacking. To address this gap, we introduce Merging-ensembling loss (M-Loss), a novel evaluation metric that quantifies the compatibility of merging source models using very limited unlabeled data. By measuring the discrepancy between parameter averaging and model ensembling at layer and node levels, M-Loss facilitates more effective merging strategies. Specifically, M-Loss serves both as a quantitative criterion of the theoretical feasibility of model merging, and a guide for parameter significance in model pruning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate that incorporating M-Loss into the merging process significantly improves the alignment between merged models and model ensembling, providing a scalable and efficient framework for accurate model consolidation."}

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.

We propose Laplacian-LoRA, a simple and interpretable low-rank spectral adaptation of standard GCNs. Rather than redesigning message passing, Laplacian-LoRA introduces a learnable, spectrally anchored correction to the fixed Laplacian propagation operator, selectively weakening contraction while preserving stability and the low-pass inductive bias. Across multiple benchmark datasets and depths, Laplacian-LoRA consistently delays the onset of oversmoothing, extending the effective depth of GCNs by up to a factor of two. Embedding variance diagnostics confirm that these gains arise from delayed representational collapse, while learned spectral analysis demonstrates that the correction is smooth, bounded, and well behaved. Our results show that oversmoothing is a depth-dependent spectral phenomenon that can be systematically delayed through modest, low-rank adaptation of the graph propagation operator."}

There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind.

Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation. We consider the question: how much direction intervention/interaction is needed to achieve success in all trials? We demonstrate that even minimal human involvement can significantly enhance overall navigation performance."}

Motivated by recent progress in conditional sequence modeling (CSM), which enables flexible goal-conditioned control by specifying target returns, we propose RCDT, a CSM-based method that supports zero-shot deployment across multiple cost thresholds within a single trained policy. RCDT is the first CSM-based offline safe RL algorithm that integrates a Lagrangian-style cost penalty with an auto-adaptive penalty coefficient. To avoid overly conservative behavior and achieve a more favorable return--cost trade-off, a reward--cost-aware trajectory reweighting mechanism and Q-value regularization are further incorporated.

SurfAge-Net establishes a new modeling paradigm by incorporating the connectomic principles of cortical organization: it explicitly models both intra- and inter-hemispheric dependencies through a spatial-channel mixing and a lateralization-aware attention mechanism, enabling the network to characterize the coordinate maturation pattern uniquely associated with each target region. Validated on three fetal and neonatal datasets, SurfAge-Net outperforms existing approaches (global MAE = 0.54, regional MAE = 0.45 in gestational/postmenstrual weeks) and demonstrates strong generalizability across external cohorts. Importantly, it provides spatially precise and biologically interpretable maps of cortical maturation, effectively identifying heterogeneous delays and regional-specific abnormalities in atypical developmental populations.

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies."}

Federated prompt learning mitigates this issue by keeping the VLPM backbone frozen and collaboratively training lightweight prompt parameters. However, existing approaches typically enforce a unified prompt structure and length across clients, which is inadequate under practical client heterogeneity in both data distributions and system resources, and may further introduce conflicts between globally shared and locally optimal knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{SDFed}, a heterogeneous federated prompt learning framework that bridges Local-Global Discrepancy via Subspace Refinement and Divergence Control. SDFed maintains a fixed-length global prompt for efficient aggregation while allowing each client to learn a variable-length local prompt to better match its data characteristics and capacity. To mitigate local-global conflicts and facilitate effective knowledge transfer, SDFed introduces a subspace refinement method for local prompts and an information retention and divergence control strategy that preserves key local information while maintaining appropriate separability between global and local representations. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SDFed consistently improves performance and robustness in heterogeneous federated settings."}

Although logs originate from nested component executions with clear boundaries, this structure is lost when they are stored as flat sequences. As a result, state-of-the-art methods risk missing true dependencies within executions while learning spurious ones across unrelated events. We propose KRONE, the first hierarchical anomaly detection framework that automatically derives execution hierarchies from flat logs for modular multi-level anomaly detection. At its core, the KRONE Log Abstraction Model captures application-specific semantic hierarchies from log data. This hierarchy is then leveraged to recursively decompose log sequences into multiple levels of coherent execution chunks, referred to as KRONE Seqs, transforming sequence-level anomaly detection into a set of modular KRONE Seq-level detection tasks. For each test KRONE Seq, KRONE employs a hybrid modular detection mechanism that dynamically routes between an efficient level-independent Local-Context detector, which rapidly filters normal sequences, and a Nested-Aware detector that incorporates cross-level semantic dependencies and supports LLM-based anomaly detection and explanation. KRONE further optimizes hierarchical detection through cached result reuse and early-exit strategies. Experiments on three public benchmarks and one industrial dataset from ByteDance Cloud demonstrate that KRONE achieves consistent improvements in detection accuracy, F1-score, data efficiency, resource efficiency, and interpretability. KRONE improves the F1-score by more than 10 percentage points over prior methods while reducing LLM usage to only a small fraction of the test data."}

We present a theoretical comparison of conditional diffusion and autoregressive diffusion with diffusion loss, demonstrating that patch denoising optimization in autoregressive models effectively mitigates condition errors and leads to a stable condition distribution. Our analysis also reveals that autoregressive condition generation refines the condition, causing the condition error influence to decay exponentially. In addition, we introduce a novel condition refinement approach based on Optimal Transport (OT) theory to address ``condition inconsistency''. We theoretically demonstrate that formulating condition refinement as a Wasserstein Gradient Flow ensures convergence toward the ideal condition distribution, effectively mitigating condition inconsistency. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over diffusion and autoregressive models with diffusion loss methods."}

However, the existing methods face notable limitations, including limited pre-training scale or heavy reliance on textual information. Motivated by the success of tabular foundation models (TFMs) in achieving universal prediction across diverse tabular datasets, we explore an alternative approach by TFMs, which are pre-trained on diverse synthetic datasets sampled from structural causal models and support strong in-context learning independent of textual attributes. Nevertheless, adapting TFMs for link prediction faces severe technical challenges such as how to obtain the necessary context and capture link-centric topological information. To solve these challenges, we propose TFMLinker (Tabular Foundation Model for Link Predictor), aiming to leverage the in-context learning capabilities of TFMs to perform link prediction across diverse graphs without requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. Specifically, we first develop a prototype-augmented local-global context module to construct context that captures both graph-specific and cross-graph transferable patterns. Next, we design a universal topology-aware link encoder to capture link-centric topological information and generate link representations as inputs for the TFM. Finally, we employ the TFM to predict link existence through in-context learning. Experiments on 6 graph benchmarks across diverse domains demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines without requiring dataset-specific finetuning."}

We propose Distance-Guided Reinforcement Learning (DGRL), combining Sampled Dynamic Neighborhoods (SDN) and Distance-Based Updates (DBU) to enable efficient RL in spaces with up to 10$^\\text{20}$ actions. Unlike prior methods, SDN leverages a semantic embedding space to perform stochastic volumetric exploration, provably providing full support over a local trust region. Complementing this, DBU transforms policy optimization into a stable regression task, decoupling gradient variance from action space cardinality and guaranteeing monotonic policy improvement. DGRL naturally generalizes to hybrid continuous-discrete action spaces without requiring hierarchical dependencies.

Nearly 40 years ago, Cederquist et al. demonstrated that asymmetric apertures enable phase retrieval (PR) algorithms to perform fully computational wavefront sensing, albeit at a high computational cost. More recently, Chimitt et al. extended this approach with machine learning and demonstrated real-time wavefront sensing using only a single (guidestar-based) point-spread-function (PSF) measurement. Inspired by these works, we introduce a guidestar-free AO framework built around asymmetric apertures and machine learning. Our approach combines three key elements: (1) an asymmetric aperture placed in the optical path that enables PR-based wavefront sensing, (2) a pair of machine learning algorithms that estimate the PSF from natural scene measurements and reconstruct phase aberrations, and (3) a spatial light modulator that performs optical correction. We experimentally validate this framework on dense natural scenes imaged through unknown obscurants. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art guidestar-free wavefront shaping methods, using an order of magnitude fewer measurements and three orders of magnitude less computation."}

ERIS combines a model partitioning strategy, distributing aggregation across multiple client-side aggregators, with a distributed shifted gradient compression mechanism. We theoretically prove that ERIS (i) converges at the same rate as FedAvg under standard assumptions, and (ii) bounds mutual information leakage inversely with the number of aggregators, enabling strong privacy guarantees with no accuracy degradation.

We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations."}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE."}

We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design."}

In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations.

However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training."}

In this work, we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to synthesize a unified textual representation for each member. Our approach leverages implicit user engagement signals (e.g., clicks, applies) as the primary reward to distill salient information. Additionally, the framework is complemented by rule-based rewards that enforce formatting and length constraints.

Test-time latent optimization can unlock substantially better reward-guided generations from pretrained generative models, but it is prone to reward hacking that degrades quality and also too slow for practical use. In this work, we make test-time optimization both efficient and reliable by replacing soft regularization with hard white Gaussian noise constraints enforced via projected gradient ascent. Our method applies a closed-form projection after each update to keep the latent vector explicitly noise-like throughout optimization, preventing the drift that leads to unrealistic artifacts. This enforcement adds minimal cost: the projection matches the $O(N \\log N)$ complexity of standard algorithms such as sorting or FFT and does not practically increase wall-clock time. In experiments, our approach reaches a comparable Aesthetic Score using only 30% of the wall-clock time required by the SOTA regularization-based method, while preventing reward hacking."}

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs."}

This thesis presents EMSYNC (EMotion and SYNChronization), a fast, free, and automatic solution that generates music tailored to the input video, enabling content creators to enhance their productions without composing or licensing music. Our model creates music that is emotionally and rhythmically synchronized with the video. A core component of EMSYNC is a novel video emotion classifier. By leveraging pretrained deep neural networks for feature extraction and keeping them frozen while training only fusion layers, we reduce computational complexity while improving accuracy. We show the generalization abilities of our method by obtaining state-of-the-art results on Ekman-6 and MovieNet. Another key contribution is a large-scale, emotion-labeled MIDI dataset for affective music generation. We then present an emotion-based MIDI generator, the first to condition on continuous emotional values rather than discrete categories, enabling nuanced music generation aligned with complex emotional content. To enhance temporal synchronization, we introduce a novel temporal boundary conditioning method, called \"boundary offset encodings,\" aligning musical chords with scene changes. Combining video emotion classification, emotion-based music generation, and temporal boundary conditioning, EMSYNC emerges as a fully automatic video-based music generator. User studies show that it consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of music richness, emotional alignment, temporal synchronization, and overall preference, setting a new state-of-the-art in video-based music generation."}

Furthermore, Geo-IQL does not degrade performance on stable manifolds. Crucially, we validate our algorithm on the MIMIC-III Sepsis critical care dataset. While standard IQL collapses to behaviour cloning, Geo-IQL demonstrates active policy improvement.

However, most existing synthesis strategies focus on maintaining statistical information. Although some studies address prediction performance guarantees, their single-stage synthesis designs make it challenging to balance the privacy requirements that necessitate significant perturbations and the prediction performance that is sensitive to such perturbations. We propose a two-stage synthesis strategy. In the first stage, we introduce a synthesis-then-hybrid strategy, which involves a synthesis operation to generate pure synthetic data, followed by a hybrid operation that fuses the synthetic data with the original data. In the second stage, we present a kernel ridge regression (KRR)-based synthesis strategy, where a KRR model is first trained on the original data and then used to generate synthetic outputs based on the synthetic inputs produced in the first stage. By leveraging the theoretical strengths of KRR and the covariant distribution retention achieved in the first stage, our proposed two-stage synthesis strategy enables a statistics-driven restricted privacy--prediction trade-off and guarantee optimal prediction performance. We validate our approach and demonstrate its characteristics of being statistics-driven and restricted in achieving the privacy--prediction trade-off both theoretically and numerically. Additionally, we showcase its generalizability through applications to a marketing problem and five real-world datasets."}

A key challenge in this setting arises from the lack of semantic alignment between prompt instructions that encode similar distributional patterns of missing data across different clients. To address this, our framework introduces specialized client-tuning and server-aggregation designs that simultaneously optimize, align, and aggregate prompt-tuning instructions across clients and data modalities. This allows prompt instructions to complement one another and be combined effectively.

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks."}

By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme. This structural innovation gives rise to two distinct personas: the Speedy Mode (S Mode), which audaciously lowers the M2T threshold to bypass traditional constraints while relying on T2T to refine the output; and the Quality Mode (Q Mode), which leans into conservative thresholds to secure superior benchmark performances with manageable efficiency degrade.

Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints.

LLM agents maintain working memory through their context window, which stores interaction history for decision-making. Conventional agents indiscriminately accumulate all tool outputs and reasoning traces in this memory, creating two critical vulnerabilities: (1) injected instructions persist throughout the workflow, granting attackers multiple opportunities to manipulate behavior, and (2) verbose, non-essential content degrades decision-making capabilities. Existing defenses treat bloated memory as given and focus on remaining resilient, rather than reducing unnecessary accumulation to prevent the attack.\n  We present AgentSys, a framework that defends against indirect prompt injection through explicit memory management. Inspired by process memory isolation in operating systems, AgentSys organizes agents hierarchically: a main agent spawns worker agents for tool calls, each running in an isolated context and able to spawn nested workers for subtasks. External data and subtask traces never enter the main agent's memory; only schema-validated return values can cross boundaries through deterministic JSON parsing. Ablations show isolation alone cuts attack success to 2.19%, and adding a validator/sanitizer further improves defense with event-triggered checks whose overhead scales with operations rather than context length.\n  On AgentDojo and ASB, AgentSys achieves 0.78% and 4.25% attack success while slightly improving benign utility over undefended baselines.

Our extremely simple technique for MLPs -- to give the first layer a nonzero mean -- speeds up training on small-scale vision tasks like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k. Though its effect is much smaller than spatial mixing initializations, it can be used in conjunction with them for an additional positive effect."}

Capturing chirality in machine learning models remains challenging due to the geometric complexity of stereochemical relationships and the limitations of traditional molecular representations that often lack explicit stereochemical encoding. Existing approaches to chiral molecular representation primarily focus on central chirality, relying on handcrafted stereochemical tags or limited 3D encodings, and thus fail to generalize to more complex forms such as axial chirality. In this work, we introduce ChiDeK (Chiral Determinant Kernels), a framework that systematically integrates stereogenic information into molecular representation learning. We propose the chiral determinant kernel to encode the SE(3)-invariant chirality matrix and employ cross-attention to integrate stereochemical information from local chiral centers into the global molecular representation. This design enables explicit modeling of chiral-related features within a unified architecture, capable of jointly encoding central and axial chirality. To support the evaluation of axial chirality, we construct a new benchmark for electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation (OR) prediction. Across four tasks, including R/S configuration classification, enantiomer ranking, ECD spectrum prediction, and OR prediction, ChiDeK achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, most notably yielding over 7% higher accuracy on axially chiral tasks on average."}

Existing facial image quality assessment (FIQA) predominantly focus on either visual quality or recognition-oriented evaluation, thereby failing to jointly address visual quality and fidelity, which are critical for surveillance applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the first comprehensive study on surveillance facial image quality assessment (SFIQA), targeting the unique challenges inherent to surveillance scenarios. Specifically, we first construct SFIQA-Bench, a multi-dimensional quality assessment benchmark for surveillance facial images, which consists of 5,004 surveillance facial images captured by three widely deployed surveillance cameras in real-world scenarios. A subjective experiment is conducted to collect six dimensional quality ratings, including noise, sharpness, colorfulness, contrast, fidelity and overall quality, covering the key aspects of SFIQA. Furthermore, we propose SFIQA-Assessor, a lightweight multi-task FIQA model that jointly exploits complementary facial views through cross-view feature interaction, and employs learnable task tokens to guide the unified regression of multiple quality dimensions. The experiment results on the proposed dataset show that our method achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art general image quality assessment (IQA) and FIQA methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world surveillance applications."}

To explain these differences, we fit a mechanistic model that captures systematic deviations from optimal behavior via four interpretable latent variables: memory, strategy, choice bias, and occlusion awareness. This model places humans and models in a shared low-dimensional cognitive space, reproduces behavioral signatures across agents, and shows how chain-of-thought shifts language models toward human-like regimes of evidence accumulation and belief-to-choice mapping, tightening alignment in inference while leaving a persistent gap in information acquisition."}

We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions.

Here, we study noise-robust learning: are transformers trained on data with noisy features able to find a target function that correctly predicts labels for noiseless features? We show that transformers succeed at noise-robust learning for a selection of $k$-sparse parity and majority functions, compared to LSTMs which fail at this task for even modest feature noise. However, we find that transformers typically fail at noise-robust learning of random $k$-juntas, especially when the boolean sensitivity of the optimal solution is smaller than that of the target function. We argue that this failure is due to a combination of two factors: transformers' bias toward simpler functions, combined with an observation that the optimal function for noise-robust learning typically has lower sensitivity than the target function for random boolean functions. We test this hypothesis by exploiting transformers' simplicity bias to trap them in an incorrect solution, but show that transformers can escape this trap by training with an additional loss term penalizing high-sensitivity solutions. Overall, we find that transformers are particularly ineffective for learning boolean functions in the presence of feature noise."}

A popular and promising approach is to regularize actor-critic methods with behavior cloning (BC), which yields realistic policies and mitigates bias from out-of-distribution actions, but can impose an often-overlooked performance ceiling: when dataset actions are suboptimal, indiscriminate imitation structurally prevents the actor from fully exploiting high-value regions suggested by the critic, especially in later training when imitation is already dominant. We formally analyzed this limitation by investigating convergence properties of BC-regularized actor-critic optimization and verified it on a controlled continuous bandit task. To break this ceiling, we propose proximal action replacement (PAR), a plug-and-play training sample replacer that progressively replaces low-value actions with high-value actions generated by a stable actor, broadening the action exploration space while reducing the impact of low-value data.

Our primary innovation is Foundational Knowledge Distillation (FKD), which looks outward beyond the confines of medical imaging by introducing a pre-trained visual foundation model, DINOv3, as an unbiased external semantic teacher. Instead of trusting the student's biased high confidence, our method distills knowledge from DINOv3's robust understanding of high semantic uniqueness, providing a stable, cross-domain supervisory signal that anchors the learning of minority classes. To complement this core strategy, we further look outward within the data by proposing Progressive Imbalance-aware CutMix (PIC), which creates a dynamic curriculum that adaptively forces the model to focus on minority classes in both labeled and unlabeled subsets. This layered strategy forms our framework, DINO-Mix, which breaks the vicious cycle of bias and achieves remarkable performance on challenging semi-supervised class-imbalanced medical image segmentation benchmarks Synapse and AMOS."}

On the optimization side, we introduce sample splitting, a curvature-aware refinement step applicable to general reconstruction objectives (not limited to KKT-based formulations): it creates additional descent directions to escape poor stationary points and refine solutions.

We introduce a scalable pipeline that converts noisy pull request diffs into Search/Replace edit blocks through reconstruction and validation, resulting in the largest publicly available corpus of 2 million pull requests spanning 12 programming languages. Using this training signal, we perform a mid-training stage followed by an agentless-aligned supervised fine-tuning process with error-driven data augmentation. On SWE-bench, our model significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned baseline, achieving absolute improvements of 13.6% on SWE-bench Lite and 12.3% on SWE-bench Verified.

By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models.

Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin."}

Instead of trying to reconstruct missing views, an adjusted center contrastive loss is used for self-supervised representation learning and view alignment, mitigating the impact of missing views on multiview fusion. This loss formulation allows for the integration of view weights to account for view quality.

Unfortunately, existing local differentially private GNNs either only preserve link privacy or suffer significant utility loss in the process of preserving link and node feature privacy. In this paper, we propose an effective LDP framework, called HoGS, which trains GNNs with link and feature protection by generating a synthetic graph.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution."}

Our analysis shows that current MLLMs exhibit weak visual focus: early-stage visual misalignment is rarely corrected during subsequent reasoning, leading to error propagation and failed inferences. We argue that this limitation stems from inadequate credit assignment for visual attention during training. To address this issue, we propose SAYO, a visual reasoning model trained with a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that introduces a region-level visual attention-based reward. This reward explicitly aligns optimization signals with visually grounded reasoning steps, enabling the model to learn more reliable attention behaviors. Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that SAYO consistently improves performance on diverse reasoning and perception tasks."}

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults."}

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling."}

Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation.

However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world robotic manipulation tasks."}

To address this, we introduce How2Everything, a scalable framework to evaluate and improve goal-conditioned procedure generation. Our framework includes How2Mine, which mines 351K procedures from 980K web pages across 14 topics and readily scales to larger corpora. From this pool we build How2Bench, a 7K-example evaluation set balanced across topics. To reliably score model outputs, we develop How2Score, an evaluation protocol that uses an LLM judge to detect whether a generation contains any critical failure that would prevent achieving the goal. For low-cost, reproducible evaluation, we distill a frontier model into an open 8B model, achieving 80.5% agreement with human annotators. How2Bench reveals clear scaling trends across model sizes and training stages, providing signal early in pretraining. Finally, RL using How2Score as a reward improves performance on How2Bench by >10 points across three models without systematic regressions on standard benchmarks, with gains robust to superficial source-document memorization or format compliance.

To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity. UReason provides a principled testbed for studying reasoning in unified models and motivates future methods that effectively integrate reasoning for visual generation while mitigating interference."}

Numerical investigations show that this task retains key qualitative aspects of how Transformers develop match-and-copy circuits in practice, and separates architectures by their retrieval capabilities. We also analyze the optimization dynamics in a simplified attention setting.

To address these limitations by introducing human models into the reasoning process, we propose CoTZero, an annotation-free paradigm with two components: (i) a dual-stage data synthesis approach and (ii) a cognition-aligned training method. In the first component, we draw inspiration from neurocognitive accounts of compositional productivity and global-to-local analysis. In the bottom-up stage, CoTZero extracts atomic visual primitives and incrementally composes them into diverse, structured question-reasoning forms. In the top-down stage, it enforces hierarchical reasoning by using coarse global structure to guide the interpretation of local details and causal relations. In the cognition-aligned training component, built on the synthesized CoT data, we introduce Cognitively Coherent Verifiable Rewards (CCVR) in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to further strengthen VLMs' hierarchical reasoning and generalization, providing stepwise feedback on reasoning coherence and factual correctness. Experiments show that CoTZero achieves an F1 score of 83.33 percent on our multi-level semantic inconsistency benchmark with lexical-perturbation negatives, across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%).

This suggests standard RLHF objectives do not guarantee robustness to future adaptation. To address it, most prior work designs downstream-time methods to preserve previously learned behaviors. We argue that preventing this requires pre-finetuning robustness: the base policy should avoid brittle high-reward solutions whose reward drops sharply under standard fine-tuning.\n  We propose Fine-tuning Robust Policy Optimization (FRPO), a robust RLHF framework that optimizes reward not only at the current policy, but across a KL-bounded neighborhood of policies reachable by downstream adaptation. The key idea is to ensure reward stability under policy shifts via a max-min formulation. By modifying GRPO, we develop an algorithm with no extra computation, and empirically show it substantially reduces safety degradation across multiple base models and downstream fine-tuning regimes (SFT and RL) while preserving downstream task performance. We further study a math-focused RL setting, demonstrating that FRPO preserves accuracy under subsequent fine-tuning."}

We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions.

We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches.

Failure to meet these conditions can place reuse outside the scope of the license, effectively leaving AI artifacts under default copyright for those uses and exposing downstream users to litigation. We call this phenomenon ``permissive washing'': labeling AI artifacts as free to use, while omitting the legal documentation required to make that label actionable. To assess how widespread permissive washing is in the AI supply chain, we empirically audit 124,278 dataset $\\rightarrow$ model $\\rightarrow$ application supply chains, spanning 3,338 datasets, 6,664 models, and 28,516 applications across Hugging Face and GitHub.

Furthermore, the lack of labels in the target graph makes it impossible to assess its homophily level beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose a novel homophily-agnostic approach that effectively transfers knowledge between graphs with varying degrees of homophily. Specifically, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that first separately reconstructs highly homophilic and heterophilic variants of both the source and target graphs, and then performs knowledge alignment separately between corresponding graph variants. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly highlighting its substantial advantages on heterophilic graphs."}

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems."}

Conversely, spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency due to their binary and event-driven characteristics, thus motivating the study of ANN-to-SNN conversion. In this process, quantization plays a pivotal role, mapping LLMs' floating-point parameters to discrete SNN parameters via the temporal dimension of the time window. However, several challenges remain in the conversion process: (i) converting high bit-width quantization values into binary spikes requires longer time windows, increasing system latency; and (ii) the inherent trade-off between the information loss of single-spike schemes and the energy costs of multi-spike ones in SNN. To address these challenges, we propose Kirin, a integer and spike hybrid based SNN to achieve accuracy lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion with time and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first propose a Spike Matrix Hybridization strategy that encoding low bit-width parameters that leading to small time window size into binary spikes while preserving the rest in integer format, thereby reducing the overall latency of SNN execution. Second, we introduce a silence threshold mechanism to regulate the timing of single-spike firing, ensuring the output is mathematically equivalent to the LLM's output and preserves accuracy.

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone.

Here, we introduce FlexMoRE, a Flexible Mixture of Rank-heterogenous Experts, which may be either full-sized experts or adapters of a suitable rank. We systematically investigate the trade-off between expert rank and downstream task performance by evaluating $6$ experts with ranks $2^0$ to $2^{14}$ resulting in experiments covering 150 mixtures (96 with 2 experts, 54 with 7 experts) that are evaluated across $120$ tasks.

In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of this asymmetry throughout training evolution and show that, even on the same task, improving generation does not lead to corresponding improvements in self-verification. Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models demonstrate performance gains over generation-only training in both generation and verification capabilities."}

Our position is that much of the technical literature relies on traditional reconstruction techniques that are not designed for copyright analysis.

We argue that memorization, as commonly studied in data science, should not be equated with copying and should not be used as a proxy for copyright infringement.

As RL is increasingly applied to settings such as verifiable rewards and multi-objective alignment, RMs are expected to encode more complex and multifaceted preference distributions. However, classifier RMs remain static once trained, limiting their adaptability at test time. We propose Variational In-Context Reward Modeling (ICRM), a novel Bayesian reward modeling objective that enables test-time steerability via in-context preference demonstrations. ICRM casts reward modeling as amortized variational inference over a latent preference probability under the Bradley-Terry model using a conjugate Beta prior. We show that ICRM adapt to unseen preference distributions at test time for both single and multi-objective settings. With more in-context demonstrations, ICRM gains 34% accuracy on SafeRLHF and 9% accuracy on RM-Bench in the single-objective setting, while widening the Pareto frontier with a 4% gain in hypervolume on helpfulness and refusal benchmarks. We further study the practical applicability of ICRM for RL training, showing that it can effectively encode verifiable rewards by outperforming a conventional RM in math reasoning. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees that the variational objective admits a global interior optimum with finite confidence, and we analyze how KL regularization mitigates reward over-optimization."}

We validate our model both qualitatively and quantitatively using held-out data from the training dataset, as well as an independent external dataset. The brain masks used for evaluation partially or fully include the subarachnoid space, which may introduce bias into the comparison; nonetheless, our model demonstrates strong performance on the held-out test data, achieving a consistent mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.964$\\pm$0.006 and an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.4mm$\\pm$0.2mm.

Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends.

To resolve these limitations, we leverage a key insight: over-parameterized LLMs often converge to Flat Minima, implying a vast equivalent solution space where weights can be adjusted without compromising accuracy. Building on this, we propose Astro, an Activation-guided Structured Regularization framework designed to suppress the negative effects of outliers in a hardware-friendly and efficient manner. Leveraging the activation-guided regularization objective, Astro actively reconstructs intrinsically robust weights, aggressively suppressing weight outliers corresponding to high-magnitude activations without sacrificing model accuracy.

To interpret this phenomenon, we revisit MSF through the lens of Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which characterizes the local stability and sharpness of the loss landscape while providing a theoretical foundation for modeling generalization error. To quantify loss sharpness, we introduce the concept of Local Robust Radius, measuring the smallest perturbation required to flip a prediction and establishing a theoretical link between local stability and generalization. Building on this perspective, we further observe a continual decrease in the robust radius during training, indicating weakened local stability and an increasingly sharp loss landscape that gives rise to MSF. To jointly solve the MSF phenomenon and the intractability of radius, we develop an energy-based formulation that is theoretically proven to be monotonically correlated with the robust radius, offering a tractable and principled objective for modeling flatness and stability. Building on these insights, we propose an energy-driven generative augmentation framework (E2A) that leverages energy-guided latent perturbations to generate pseudo-OOD samples and enhance model generalization.

Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

In particular, Transformers have been suggested to length-generalize exactly on problems that have simple RASP programs. However, it remains open whether trained models actually implement simple interpretable programs. In this paper, we present a general method to extract such programs from trained Transformers. The idea is to faithfully re-parameterize a Transformer as a RASP program and then apply causal interventions to discover a small sufficient sub-program. In experiments on small Transformers trained on algorithmic and formal language tasks, we show that our method often recovers simple and interpretable RASP programs from length-generalizing transformers. Our results provide the most direct evidence so far that Transformers internally implement simple RASP programs."}

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for automating architectural reasoning at scale. We investigated how effectively LLMs can identify decision violations in open-source systems by examining their agreement, accuracy, and inherent limitations. Our study analyzed 980 ADRs across 109 GitHub repositories using a multi-model pipeline in which one LLM primary screens potential decision violations, and three additional LLMs independently validate the reasoning. We assessed agreement, accuracy, precision, and recall, and complemented the quantitative findings with expert evaluation. The models achieved substantial agreement and strong accuracy for explicit, code-inferable decisions. Accuracy falls short for implicit or deployment-oriented decisions that depend on deployment configuration or organizational knowledge. Therefore, LLMs can meaningfully support validation of architectural decision compliance; however, they are not yet replacing human expertise for decisions not focused on code."}

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

We propose \\textit{magnitude distance}, a novel distance metric defined on finite datasets using the notion of the \\emph{magnitude} of a metric space. The proposed distance incorporates a tunable scaling parameter, $t$, that controls the sensitivity to global structure (small $t$) and finer details (large $t$). We prove several theoretical properties of magnitude distance, including its limiting behavior across scales and conditions under which it satisfies key metric properties. In contrast to classical distances, we show that magnitude distance remains discriminative in high-dimensional settings when the scale is appropriately tuned. We further demonstrate how magnitude distance can be used as a training objective for push-forward generative models. Our experimental results support our theoretical analysis and demonstrate that magnitude distance provides meaningful signals, comparable to established distance-based generative approaches."}

To address the fundamental tension between batch decoding and expert sparsity, we present SERE, a Similarity-based Expert Re-routing method for Efficient batch decoding in MoE models. SERE dynamically reduces the number of active experts in an input-aware manner by re-routing tokens from secondary experts to their most similar primary counterparts. It also leverages similarity patterns to identify and preserve critical experts, thereby preventing capability loss. Notably, SERE avoids static expert pruning or merging, instead enabling dynamic expert skipping based on batch-level expert redundancy. Additionally, we provide an efficient custom CUDA kernel for SERE, enabling plug-and-play use in vLLM with only a single-line code change. Extensive experiments on various complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SERE achieves up to 2.0x speedup with minimal quality loss, providing a practical solution for cost-efficient and latency-sensitive large-scale MoE deployment.

Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $χ_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $χ_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $χ_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $π_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs.

At its core, an expert chain-of-thought trace is generated to provide a verifiable, fine-grained reasoning from classical analyses (e.g., statistical measures, frequency transforms).

Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes.\n  Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio.

We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient.

Existing mitigation methods apply interventions uniformly, degrading performance on the majority of tokens that generalize normally. We show empirically that memorization is sparse, intermittent, and token-conditioned, suggesting that effective mitigation requires context-aware intervention rather than static parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel and effective selective memorization mitigation method -- Gated Subspace Steering (GSS), which decomposes intervention into a probe (detecting memorization-relevant activations) and a steer (applying targeted correction only when the probe exceeds a threshold). The optimal probe-steer pair emerges from a principled optimization framework based on optimal subspace steering. Experiments on four benchmarks show GSS matches or exceeds state-of-the-art memorization reduction while requiring $100-1000 \\times$ less compute than optimization-based alternatives.

Using KernelBench as our testbed and a 120B-parameter model (GPT-OSS-120B with LoRA adaptation), we find that search outperforms minimal adaptation (1-5 gradient steps): Best-of-N sampling achieves 90% task success (18/20 tasks) at K=64 across the full KernelBench L1 eval set while TTT's best checkpoint reaches only 30.6% (3-seed mean), with TTT's \"equivalent K\" falling below 1, worse than single-sample inference. The failure mode is over-sharpening: gradient updates collapse diversity toward mediocre solutions rather than discovering optimal ones. Our main contribution is surprisal-guided selection: selecting the highest-surprisal (lowest-confidence) correct sample yields 80% success vs. 50% for most-confident selection, a 30% improvement. Extending to surprisal-guided-top3 matches oracle performance at 100%. This zero-cost strategy, validated through length-controlled analysis, recovers oracle performance. For dense-reward VEG tasks, compute should be allocated to sample diversity and intelligent selection rather than gradient adaptation. The surprisal-guided selection principle may generalize to other execution-grounded domains where optimal solutions occupy the distribution tail."}

In contrast, we argue that with a well-chosen D'(x), the shift can be positive and make learning easier -- a perspective called Positive Distribution Shift (PDS). Such a perspective is central to contemporary machine learning, where much of the innovation is in finding good training distributions D'(x), rather than changing the training algorithm.

We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types."}

To propose a stability-preserving way to inject spectral capacity into existing MLP/FFN layers under fixed parameter and training budgets, we introduce Spectral Gating Networks (SGN), a drop-in spectral reparameterization. SGN augments a standard activation pathway with a compact spectral pathway and learnable gates that allow the model to start from a stable base behavior and progressively allocate capacity to spectral features during training. The spectral pathway is instantiated with trainable Random Fourier Features (learned frequencies and phases), replacing grid-based splines and removing resolution dependence. A hybrid GELU-Fourier formulation further improves optimization robustness while enhancing high-frequency fidelity. Across vision, NLP, audio, and PDE benchmarks, SGN consistently improves accuracy-efficiency trade-offs under comparable computational budgets, achieving 93.15% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and up to 11.7x faster inference than spline-based KAN variants.

We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

Motivated by MODIS vegetation index studies, we examine predictors from spectral bands, productivity and energy fluxes, observation geometry, and land surface characteristics. Because these relationships vary with canopy structure, climate, land use, and measurement conditions, methods should both model spatially varying effects and identify where predictors matter. We propose a spatially varying coefficient model where each coefficient surface uses a tensor product B-spline basis and a Bayesian group lasso prior on the basis coefficients. This prior induces predictor level shrinkage, pushing negligible effects toward zero while preserving spatial structure. Posterior inference uses Markov chain Monte Carlo and provides uncertainty quantification for each effect surface. We summarize retained effects with spatial significance maps that mark locations where the 95 percent posterior credible interval excludes zero, and we define a spatial coverage probability as the proportion of locations where the credible interval excludes zero. Simulations recover sparsity and achieve prediction. A MODIS application yields a parsimonious subset of predictors whose effect maps clarify dominant controls across landscapes."}

We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point. StealthRL achieves near-zero detection (0.001 mean TPR@1%FPR), reduces mean AUROC from 0.74 to 0.27, and attains a 99.9% attack success rate. Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals.

Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs."}

However, optimization practices in RL largely follow those of next-token prediction stages (e.g., pretraining and supervised fine-tuning), despite fundamental differences between RL and these stages highlighted by recent work. One such practice is the use of the AdamW optimizer, which is widely adopted for training large-scale transformers despite its high memory overhead. Our analysis shows that both momentum and adaptive learning rates in AdamW are less influential in RL than in SFT, leading us to hypothesize that RL benefits less from Adam-style per-parameter adaptive learning rates and momentum. Confirming this hypothesis, our experiments demonstrate that the substantially more memory-efficient SGD, which is known to perform poorly in supervised learning of large-scale transformers, matches or even outperforms AdamW in RL for LLMs. Remarkably, full fine-tuning with SGD updates fewer than 0.02% of model parameters without any sparsity-promoting regularization, more than 1000 times fewer than AdamW. Our analysis offers potential reasons for this update sparsity. These findings provide new insights into the optimization dynamics of RL in LLMs and show that RL can be substantially more parameter-efficient than previously recognized."}

To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties.

However, natural language exhibits hierarchical structure from broad topics to specific entities that Euclidean embeddings fail to preserve, causing semantically distant documents to appear spuriously similar and increasing hallucination risk. To address these limitations, we introduce hyperbolic dense retrieval, developing two model variants in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space: HyTE-FH, a fully hyperbolic transformer, and HyTE-H, a hybrid architecture projecting pre-trained Euclidean embeddings into hyperbolic space. To prevent representational collapse during sequence aggregation, we introduce the Outward Einstein Midpoint, a geometry-aware pooling operator that provably preserves hierarchical structure. On MTEB, HyTE-FH outperforms equivalent Euclidean baselines, while on RAGBench, HyTE-H achieves up to 29% gains over Euclidean baselines in context relevance and answer relevance using substantially smaller models than current state-of-the-art retrievers. Our analysis also reveals that hyperbolic representations encode document specificity through norm-based separation, with over 20% radial increase from general to specific concepts, a property absent in Euclidean embeddings, underscoring the critical role of geometric inductive bias in faithful RAG systems."}

We present \\textbf{Adaptively Rotated Optimization (ARO}, a new matrix optimization framework that treats gradient rotation as a first class design principle. ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy. This perspective yields update rules that go beyond existing orthogonalization and whitening optimizers, improving sample efficiency in practice. To make comparisons reliable, we propose a rigorously controlled benchmarking protocol that reduces confounding and bias.

However, existing work has three key limitations: (1) most efforts focus on retrieval and ranking, while the reranking phase, critical for refining final recommendations, is largely overlooked; (2) LLMs are typically used in zero-shot or supervised fine-tuning settings, leaving their reasoning abilities, especially those enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) and high-quality reasoning data, underexploited; (3) items are commonly represented by non-semantic IDs, creating major scalability challenges in industrial systems with billions of identifiers. To address these gaps, we propose the Generative Reasoning Reranker (GR2), an end-to-end framework with a three-stage training pipeline tailored for reranking. First, a pretrained LLM is mid-trained on semantic IDs encoded from non-semantic IDs via a tokenizer achieving $\\ge$99% uniqueness. Next, a stronger larger-scale LLM generates high-quality reasoning traces through carefully designed prompting and rejection sampling, which are used for supervised fine-tuning to impart foundational reasoning skills. Finally, we apply Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO), enabling scalable RL supervision with verifiable rewards designed specifically for reranking. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate GR2's effectiveness: it surpasses the state-of-the-art OneRec-Think by 2.4% in Recall@5 and 1.3% in NDCG@5. Ablations confirm that advanced reasoning traces yield substantial gains across metrics. We further find that RL reward design is crucial in reranking: LLMs tend to exploit reward hacking by preserving item order, motivating conditional verifiable rewards to mitigate this behavior and optimize reranking performance."}

Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters."}

Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation."}

In this paper, we present CausalTaD, a method that injects causal knowledge into LLMs for tabular anomaly detection. We first identify the causal relationships between columns and reorder them to align with these causal relationships. This reordering can be modeled as a linear ordering problem.

However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models."}

The core of our proposed methodology is a preliminary Doppler trace extraction stage, implemented to amplify salient motion-related signal features before classification. Subsequently, these enhanced inputs are processed by a hybrid neural architecture, which integrates Inception networks responsible for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks that capture temporal dependencies. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is then utilized as the final classification layer to optimize decision boundaries. The framework's efficacy was systematically validated using a public dataset across 20, 40, and 80 MHz bandwidth configurations. The model yielded accuracies of 89.27% (20 MHz), 94.13% (40 MHz), and 95.30% (80 MHz), respectively. These results confirm a marked superiority over standalone deep learning baselines, especially in the most constrained low-bandwidth scenarios. This study underscores the utility of combining Doppler-based feature engineering with a hybrid learning architecture for reliable HAR in bandwidth-limited wireless sensing applications."}

X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) coupled with numerical simulations is commonly used to investigate the multiphase flow behaviors in carbonate rocks. Carbonates exhibit pore size distribution across scales, hindering the comprehensive investigation with conventional X-ray CT images. Imaging samples at both macro and micro-scales (multi-scale imaging) proved to be a viable option in this context. However, multi-scale imaging faces two key limitations: the trade-off between field of view and voxel size necessitates resource-intensive imaging, while multi-scale multi-physics numerical simulations on resulting digital models incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose a machine learning-enhanced data assimilation framework that leverages experimental drainage relative permeability measurements to achieve efficient characterization of micro-scale structures, delivering a data-driven solution toward a high-fidelity multiscale digital rock modeling. We train a dense neural network (DNN) as a proxy to a multi-scale pore network simulator and couple it with an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) algorithm. DNN-ESMDA framework simultaneously infers the CO2-brine drainage relative permeability of microporosity phases with associated uncertainty estimation, revealing the relative importance of each rock phase and guiding future characterization. Our DNN-ESMDA framework achieves a computational speedup, reducing inference time from thousands of hours to seconds compared with the usage of conventional multiscale numerical simulation. Given this computational efficiency and applicability, the machine learning-enhanced ESMDA framework presents a generalizable approach for characterizing multiscale carbonate rocks."}

Controlling how LLMs internally represent concepts typically requires sophisticated methods to first identify, then intervene on the model's existing feature geometry. We bypass all of this.\n  We finetune an LLM with a simple auxiliary loss, training 16 of its 3072 residual stream dimensions to be inert interpretability flags that simply indicate what concepts are required for generation. The model reorganizes around them anyway, learning to rely on these flags during actual generation tasks. As a result, these inert flags become genuine internal features: interpretable control switches that allow us to steer generation at inference time. Why does this work? When a feature is reliably supplied at a fixed location, gradient descent gradually eliminates redundant encodings elsewhere, and the model erodes its own alternative representations. A model's efficiency pressure is a lever - exploitable to induce interpretable, controllable representations."}

This paper integrates three curriculum-learning methods as primal-dual (PD) optimization, causality progression, and adaptive sampling into the VSR-PINN. The PD strategy balances physics and data losses, the causality scheme unlocks deeper stacks by respecting temporal and gradient evolution, and adaptive sampling targets high residuals. Numerical experiments on traffic reconstruction confirm that enforcing causality systematically reduces the median point-wise MSE and its variability across runs, yielding improvements of nearly one order of magnitude over non-causal training in both the baseline and PD variants."}

In LLM reasoning, existing works also explore various solutions for learning effective process reward models (PRM) with or without the help of an expert policy. However, existing methods either rely on strong assumptions about the expert policies (e.g., requiring their reward functions) or suffer intrinsic limitations (e.g., entropy collapse), resulting in weak PRMs or limited generalizability. In this paper, we introduce rePIRL, an inverse RL-inspired framework that learns effective PRMs with minimal assumptions about expert policies. Specifically, we design a dual learning process that updates the policy and the PRM interchangeably. Our learning algorithm has customized techniques to address the challenges of scaling traditional inverse RL to LLMs. We theoretically show that our proposed learning framework can unify both online and offline PRM learning methods, justifying that rePIRL can learn PRMs with minimal assumptions. Empirical evaluations on standardized math and coding reasoning datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of rePIRL over existing methods. We further show the application of our trained PRM in test-time training, test-time scaling, and providing an early signal for training hard problems.

By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis."}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability."}

We address this challenge by directly realizing soft-policy sampling via Langevin dynamics driven by the action gradient of the Q-function. This perspective leads to Langevin Q-Learning (LQL), which samples actions from the target Boltzmann distribution without explicitly parameterizing the policy. However, directly applying Langevin dynamics suffers from slow mixing in high-dimensional and non-convex Q-landscapes, limiting its practical effectiveness. To overcome this, we propose Noise-Conditioned Langevin Q-Learning (NC-LQL), which integrates multi-scale noise perturbations into the value function. NC-LQL learns a noise-conditioned Q-function that induces a sequence of progressively smoothed value landscapes, enabling sampling to transition from global exploration to precise mode refinement.

However, we report a counter-intuitive finding that these algorithmic latency attacks are largely ineffective against modern LLM serving systems. We reveal that system-level optimization such as continuous batching provides a logical isolation to mitigate contagious latency impact on co-located users. To this end, in this paper, we shift the focus from the algorithm to the system layer, and introduce a new Fill and Squeeze attack strategy targeting the state transition of the scheduler. \"Fill\" first exhausts the global KV cache to induce Head-of-Line blocking, while \"Squeeze\" forces the system into repetitive preemption. By manipulating output lengths using methods from simple plain-text prompts to more complex prompt engineering, and leveraging side-channel probing of memory status, we demonstrate that the attack can be orchestrated in a black-box setting with much less cost.

This paper introduces Deep Variable-Length Feedback (DeepVLF) coding, a flexible coding framework that dynamically adjusts transmission length via learned feedback. We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes. Encoding dynamics analysis further reveals that the models autonomously learn a two-phase strategy analogous to classical Schalkwijk-Kailath coding: an initial information-carrying phase followed by a noise-cancellation refinement phase. This emergent behavior underscores the interpretability and information-theoretic alignment of the learned codes."}

We present a theoretical comparison of conditional diffusion and autoregressive diffusion with diffusion loss, demonstrating that patch denoising optimization in autoregressive models effectively mitigates condition errors and leads to a stable condition distribution. Our analysis also reveals that autoregressive condition generation refines the condition, causing the condition error influence to decay exponentially.

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence.

Meanwhile, despite the rapid advancement of Search Agents, their practical deployment is constrained by a fundamental limitation, termed as 1) Latency Challenge: the serial execution of multi-round reasoning, tool calling, and tool response waiting under the ReAct agent paradigm induces severe end-to-end latency. Intuitively, dLLMs can leverage their distinctive strengths to optimize the operational efficiency of agents under the ReAct agent paradigm. Practically, existing dLLM backbones face the 2) Agent Ability Challenge. That is, existing dLLMs exhibit remarkably weak reasoning and tool-calling capabilities, preventing these advantages from being effectively realized in practice. In this paper, we propose DLLM-Searcher, an optimization framework for dLLM-based Search Agents. To solve the Agent Ability Challenge, we design a two-stage post-training pipeline encompassing Agentic Supervised Fine-Tuning (Agentic SFT) and Agentic Variance-Reduced Preference Optimization Agentic VRPO, which enhances the backbone dLLM's information seeking and reasoning capabilities. To mitigate the Latency Challenge, we leverage the flexible generation mechanism of dLLMs and propose a novel agent paradigm termed Parallel-Reasoning and Acting P-ReAct. P-ReAct guides the model to prioritize decoding tool_call instructions, thereby allowing the model to keep thinking while waiting for the tool's return. Experimental results demonstrate that DLLM-Searcher achieves performance comparable to mainstream LLM-based search agents and P-ReAct delivers approximately 15% inference acceleration.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To our knowledge, SAGE pioneers the adaptation of geometric foundation models via Internet video, establishing a scalable paradigm for general-purpose 3D learning."}

To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline.

This raises the critical question: whether such tests meaningfully improve issue resolution or merely mimic human testing practices while consuming a substantial interaction budget.\n  To reveal the impact of agent-written tests, we present an empirical study that analyzes agent trajectories across six state-of-the-art LLMs on SWE-bench Verified. Our results show that while test writing is commonly adopted, but resolved and unresolved tasks within the same model exhibit similar test-writing frequencies Furthermore, these tests typically serve as observational feedback channels, where agents prefer value-revealing print statements significantly more than formal assertion-based checks. Based on these insights, we perform a controlled experiment by revising the prompts of four agents to either increase or reduce test writing. The results suggest that changes in the volume of agent-written tests do not significantly change final outcomes.

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans."}

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches."}

Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines.

The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training.

At each iteration, LMABO uses a structured state representation to prompt the LLM to select the most suitable acquisition function from a diverse portfolio. In an evaluation across 50 benchmark problems, LMABO demonstrates a significant performance improvement over strong static, adaptive portfolio, and other LLM-based baselines.

We evaluate this through a benchmark where the goal is curiosity-driven exploration to build an accurate cognitive map. A key innovation is spatial belief probing, which prompts models to reveal their internal spatial representations at each step. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals several critical bottlenecks. First, we identify an Active-Passive Gap, where performance drops significantly when agents must autonomously gather information. Second, we find high inefficiency, as models explore unsystematically compared to program-based proxies. Through belief probing, we diagnose that while perception is an initial bottleneck, global beliefs suffer from instability that causes spatial knowledge to degrade over time. Finally, using a false belief paradigm, we uncover Belief Inertia, where agents fail to update obsolete priors with new evidence. This issue is present in text-based agents but is particularly severe in vision-based models. Our findings suggest that current foundation models struggle to maintain coherent, revisable spatial beliefs during active exploration."}

We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems.

Motivated by classical mechanics, we introduce Kinetic Path Energy (KPE), an action-like, per-sample diagnostic that measures the accumulated kinetic effort along an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. Empirically, KPE exhibits two robust correspondences: (i) higher KPE predicts stronger semantic fidelity; (ii) high-KPE trajectories terminate on low-density manifold frontiers. We further provide theoretical guarantees linking trajectory energy to data density. Paradoxically, this correlation is non-monotonic. At sufficiently high energy, generation can degenerate into memorization. Leveraging the closed-form of empirical flow matching, we show that extreme energies drive trajectories toward near-copies of training examples.

We define a margin-based token-level uncertainty metric and demonstrate its correlation with model accuracy. Leveraging this metric, we design a greedy offloading algorithm (GOA) that minimizes delay while maintaining accuracy by prioritizing offloading for highuncertainty queries.

Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems."}

We argue this brittleness is often data-induced: when images carry \"silent\" evidence and queries leave key semantics implicit, a single embedding pass must both reason and compress, encouraging spurious feature matching. We propose a data-centric framework that decouples these roles by externalizing reasoning before retrieval. Using a strong Vision--Language Model, we make implicit semantics explicit by densely captioning visual evidence in corpus entries, resolving ambiguous multimodal references in queries, and rewriting verbose instructions into concise retrieval constraints. Inference-time enhancement alone is insufficient; the retriever must be trained on these semantically dense representations to avoid distribution shift and fully exploit the added signal. Across M-BEIR, our reasoning-augmented training method yields consistent gains over strong baselines, with ablations showing that corpus enhancement chiefly benefits knowledge-intensive queries while query enhancement is critical for compositional modification requests.

In this work, we propose a multi-task similarity measure based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, specifically Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) curves.\n  ALE curves are compared using the Fréchet distance, weighted by the data distribution, and the resulting similarity measure incorporates the importance of each feature. The measure is applicable in both single-task learning scenarios, where each task is trained separately, and multi-task learning scenarios, where all tasks are learned simultaneously. The measure is model-agnostic, allowing the use of different machine learning models across tasks. A scaling factor is introduced to account for differences in predictive performance across tasks, and several recommendations are provided for applying the measure in complex scenarios.\n  We validate this measure using four datasets, one synthetic dataset and three real-world datasets. The real-world datasets include a well-known Parkinson's dataset and a bike-sharing usage dataset -- both structured in tabular format -- as well as the CelebA dataset, which is used to evaluate the application of concept bottleneck encoders in a multitask learning setting. The results demonstrate that the measure aligns with intuitive expectations of task similarity across both tabular and non-tabular data, making it a valuable tool for exploring relationships between tasks and supporting informed decision-making."}

Transferring these practical successes to discrete generative modeling, however, remains particularly challenging and largely unexplored, mainly due to the drastic shift in generative model classes to discrete state spaces, which are nowhere differentiable. In this work, we propose Discrete Adjoint Matching (DAM) -- a discrete variant of AM for fine-tuning discrete generative models characterized by Continuous-Time Markov Chains, such as diffusion-based large language models. The core of DAM is the introduction of discrete adjoint-an estimator of the optimal solution to the original problem but formulated on discrete domains-from which standard matching frameworks can be applied. This is derived via a purely statistical standpoint, in contrast to the control-theoretic viewpoint in AM, thereby opening up new algorithmic opportunities for general adjoint-based estimators.

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions.

Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance."}

A major challenge, however, is slab boundary artifacts arising from non-ideal slab-selective RF excitation. Non-rectangular slab profiles reduce signal intensity at slab boundaries, while profile overlap across adjacent slabs introduces inter-slab crosstalk, where repeated excitation shortens the local TR and limits T1 recovery. To mitigate slab boundary artifacts without increasing scan time, we build on slab profile encoding and propose Slab-shifting for Harmonized 3D Acquisition and Reconstruction with Profile Encoding Networks (SHARPEN). For different diffusion directions, SHARPEN applies inter-volume field-of-view shifts along the slice direction to provide complementary slab profile encoding without prolonging acquisition. Slab profiles are estimated using a lightweight self-supervised neural network that exploits consistency across shifted acquisitions and known physical properties of slab profiles and diffusion images, and corrected images are reconstructed accordingly. SHARPEN was validated using simulated and prospectively acquired high-resolution in vivo data and demonstrates accurate slab profile estimation and robust boundary artifact correction, even in the presence of inter-volume motion. SHARPEN does not require high-quality reference training data and supports subject-specific training. Its efficient GPU-based implementation delivers faster and more accurate correction than NPEN, yielding slice-wise quantitative profiles that closely match those from reference 2D acquisitions. SHARPEN enables high-quality dMRI at 0.7 mm isotropic resolution on a 3T clinical scanner, highlighting its potential to advance submillimeter dMRI for neuroscience research."}

Furthermore, to explain why performance can saturate even with many models, we model the correlated errors of the models using Gaussian-copula and show an information-theoretic error floor for the performance of the ensemble. Motivated by these, we propose a simple greedy mutual-information selection algorithm that estimates the required information terms directly from data and iteratively builds an ensemble under a query budget.

Empirical analysis across several benchmarks reveals that our proposed uncertainty quantification reliably indicates system failures, which demonstrates the validity of using them as diagnostic metrics to indicate the system failure. Subsequently, we propose a mitigation strategy by formulating an uncertainty-driven policy optimization to penalize self-contradiction, peer conflict, and low-confidence outputs in a dynamic debating environment.

To quantify this gap, we study 12,720 notebooks mined from 79 popular Kaggle competitions: only 35.4% remain reproducible today.

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

We propose TSR, which brings two-sided low-rank communication to Adam-family updates (TSR-Adam) by synchronizing a compact core $U^\\top G V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times r}$, reducing the dominant per-step payload from $O(mn)$ to $O(r^2)$ while keeping moment states in low-dimensional cores. To further reduce the peak communication from subspace refresh, TSR-Adam adopts a randomized SVD-based refresh that avoids full-gradient synchronization. We additionally extend low-rank communication to embedding gradients with embedding-specific ranks and refresh schedules, yielding additional communication and memory savings over keeping embeddings dense. Across pretraining from 60M to 1B model scales, TSR-Adam reduces average communicated bytes per step by $13\\times$, and on GLUE fine-tuning it reduces communication by $25\\times$, while achieving comparable performance; we further provide a theoretical stationarity analysis for the proposed update.

Using training and benchmark data for 809 models released between 2022 and 2025, we estimate scaling-law regressions with release-date and developer fixed effects. We find clear evidence of developer-specific efficiency advantages, but their importance depends on where models lie in the performance distribution. At the frontier, 80-90% of performance differences are explained by higher training compute, implying that scale--not proprietary technology--drives frontier advances. Away from the frontier, however, proprietary techniques and shared algorithmic progress substantially reduce the compute required to reach fixed capability thresholds. Some companies can systematically produce smaller models more efficiently. Strikingly, we also find substantial variation of model efficiency within companies; a firm can train two models with more than 40x compute efficiency difference. We also discuss the implications for AI leadership and capability diffusion."}

Existing access control is static and centralized, unable to adapt to insider threats or evolving contexts. Blockchain improves decentralization but lacks behavioral intelligence, while centralized machine learning for anomaly detection requires aggregating sensitive data, violating privacy.\n  The proposed solution is ICBAC, an intelligent contract-based access control framework. It integrates permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric) with federated learning (FL). Built on Fabric, ICBAC uses a multi-channel architecture and three smart contracts for asset management, baseline access control, and dynamic revocation. To counter insider misuse, each channel deploys an AI agent that monitors activity and dynamically restricts access for anomalies. Federated learning allows these agents to collaboratively improve detection models without sharing raw data.\n  For heterogeneous, competitive environments, ICBAC introduces a game-theoretic client selection mechanism using hedonic coalition formation. This enables supply chains to form stable, strategy-proof FL coalitions via preference-based selection without disclosing sensitive criteria. Extensive experiments on a Fabric testbed with a real-world dataset show ICBAC achieves blockchain performance comparable to static frameworks and provides effective anomaly detection under IID and non-IID data with zero raw-data sharing. ICBAC thus offers a practical, scalable solution for dynamic, privacy-preserving access control in decentralized supply chains."}

As AVs operate in safety-critical environments, understanding their robustness in an adversarial environment is an important research problem. Prior physical adversarial attacks on vision-based autonomous vehicles predominantly target immediate safety failures (e.g., a crash, a traffic-rule violation, or a transient lane departure) by inducing a short-lived perception or control error. This paper shows a qualitatively different risk: a long-horizon route integrity compromise, where an attacker gradually steers a victim AV away from its intended route and into an attacker-chosen destination while the victim continues to drive \"normally.\" This will not pose a danger to the victim vehicle itself, but also to potential passengers sitting inside the vehicle.\n  In this paper, we design and implement the first adversarial framework, called JackZebra, that performs route-level hijacking of a vision-based end-to-end driving stack using a physically plausible attacker vehicle with a reconfigurable display mounted on the rear. The central challenge is temporal persistence: adversarial influence must remain effective in changing viewpoints, lighting, weather, traffic, and the victim's continual replanning -- without triggering conspicuous failures. Our key insight is to treat route hijacking as a closed-loop control problem and to convert adversarial patches into steering primitives that can be selected online via an interactive adjustment loop. Our adversarial patches are also carefully designed against worst-case background and sensor variations so that the adversarial impacts on the victim. Our evaluation shows that JackZebra can successfully hijack victim vehicles to deviate from original routes and stop at adversarial destinations with a high success rate."}

This sparse conditional computation mechanism significantly improves computational efficiency, paving a promising path for greater scalability and cost-efficiency. It not only enhance downstream applications such as natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal in various horizontal domains, but also exhibit broad applicability across vertical domains. Despite the growing popularity and application of MoE models across various domains, there lacks a systematic exploration of recent advancements of MoE in many important fields. Existing surveys on MoE suffer from limitations such as lack coverage or none extensively exploration of key areas. This survey seeks to fill these gaps. In this paper, Firstly, we examine the foundational principles of MoE, with an in-depth exploration of its core components-the routing network and expert network. Subsequently, we extend beyond the centralized paradigm to the decentralized paradigm, which unlocks the immense untapped potential of decentralized infrastructure, enables democratization of MoE development for broader communities, and delivers greater scalability and cost-efficiency. Furthermore we focus on exploring its vertical domain applications. Finally, we also identify key challenges and promising future research directions.

Using a two-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model, we jointly estimate latent task difficulty and model capability from model performance data across multiple benchmarks. We demonstrate that latent task difficulty varies linearly with the logarithm of human completion time, allowing human task completion time to be inferred for new benchmarks from model performance alone.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

To address this limitation, we propose STEER2ADAPT, a lightweight framework that adapts LLMs by composing steering vectors rather than learning new ones from scratch. In many domains (e.g., reasoning or safety), tasks share a small set of underlying concept dimensions. STEER2ADAPT captures these dimensions as a reusable, low-dimensional semantic prior subspace, and adapts to new tasks by dynamically discovering a linear combination of basis vectors from only a handful of examples. Experiments across 9 tasks and 3 models in both reasoning and safety domains demonstrate the effectiveness of STEER2ADAPT, achieving an average improvement of 8.2%. Extensive analyses further show that STEER2ADAPT is a data-efficient, stable, and transparent inference-time adaptation method for LLMs."}

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations. Finally, predicting the consequences of one's actions from another viewpoint may offer a foundation for perspective-taking in multi-agent settings."}

We propose FIRE, a principled reinitialization method that explicitly balances the stability-plasticity tradeoff. FIRE quantifies stability through Squared Frobenius Error (SFE), measuring proximity to past weights, and plasticity through Deviation from Isometry (DfI), reflecting weight isotropy. The reinitialization point is obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem, minimizing SFE subject to DfI being zero, which is efficiently approximated by Newton-Schulz iteration. FIRE is evaluated on continual visual learning (CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18), language modeling (OpenWebText with GPT-0.1B), and reinforcement learning (HumanoidBench with SAC and Atari games with DQN). Across all domains, FIRE consistently outperforms both naive training without intervention and standard reinitialization methods, demonstrating effective balancing of the stability-plasticity tradeoff."}

To solve this problem, we introduce Implicit Strategic Optimization (ISO), a prediction-aware framework in which each agent forecasts the current strategic context and uses it to update its policy online. ISO combines a Strategic Reward Model (SRM) that estimates the long-run strategic value of actions with iso-grpo, a context-conditioned optimistic learning rule. We prove sublinear contextual regret and equilibrium convergence guarantees whose dominant terms scale with the number of context mispredictions; when prediction errors are bounded, our bounds recover the static-game rates obtained when strategic externalities are known.

Policies are synthesized by reweighting the behavior distribution based on this epigraph value function and fitting a generative policy via flow matching, enabling efficient, distribution-consistent sampling. Across various safety-critical tasks, including Safety-Gymnasium benchmarks, EpiFlow achieves competitive returns with near-zero empirical safety violations, demonstrating the effectiveness of epigraph-guided policy synthesis."}

Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition."}

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy. We further introduce two mechanisms, i.e., one which preserves valid dark-object semantics that prior noise-suppression methods incorrectly discard, and a hierarchical decoder that enforces structural consistency across scales to sharpen boundaries on thin objects.

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry."}

Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models."}

To fundamentally reconcile these paradigms, we propose SiameseNorm, a two-stream architecture that couples Pre-Norm-like and Post-Norm-like streams with shared parameters. This design decouples the optimization dynamics of the two streams, retaining the distinct characteristics of both Pre-Norm and Post-Norm by enabling all residual blocks to receive combined gradients inherited from both paradigms, where one stream secures stability while the other enhances expressivity. Extensive pre-training experiments on 1.3B-parameter models demonstrate that SiameseNorm exhibits exceptional optimization robustness and consistently outperforms strong baselines.

In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods. The results suggest that simple statistical corrections can be effective for post-training pruning of LLMs."}

We propose mmSIVAE, a multimodal soft-introspective variational autoencoder combined with Mixture-of-Product-of-Experts (MOPOE) aggregation to improve reference fidelity and multimodal integration. We compute deviation scores in latent space and feature space as distances from the learned healthy distributions, and map statistically significant latent deviations to regional abnormalities for interpretability. On ADNI MRI regional volumes and amyloid PET SUVR, mmSIVAE improves reconstruction on held-out controls and produces more discriminative deviation scores for outlier detection than VAE baselines, with higher likelihood ratios and clearer separation between control and AD-spectrum cohorts. Deviation maps highlight region-level patterns aligned with established AD-related changes. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of training objectives that prioritize reference-distribution fidelity and robust multimodal posterior aggregation for normative modeling, with implications for deviation-based analysis across multimodal clinical data."}

In many propagation contexts, spreading processes are influenced by multiple interacting factors, such as information expression patterns, cultural contexts, living environments, cognitive preferences, and public policies, which are difficult to incorporate directly into classical modeling frameworks. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited strong capabilities in natural language understanding, reasoning, and generation, enabling explicit perception of semantic content and contextual cues in spreading processes, thereby supporting the analysis of the different influencing factors. Beyond serving as external analytical tools, LLMs can also act as interactive agents embedded in propagation systems, potentially influencing spreading pathways and feedback structures. Consequently, the roles and impacts of LLMs on spreading dynamics have become an active and rapidly growing research area across multiple research disciplines. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in applying LLMs to the study of spreading dynamics across two representative domains: digital epidemics, such as misinformation and rumors, and biological epidemics, including infectious disease outbreaks. We first examine the foundations of epidemic modeling from a complex-systems perspective and discuss how LLM-based approaches relate to traditional frameworks. We then systematically review recent studies from three key perspectives, which are epidemic modeling, epidemic detection and surveillance, and epidemic prediction and management, to clarify how LLMs enhance these areas.

Neither humans nor single-agent LLMs can fully contend with this torrent of information, with the latter often prone to hallucinations. To address this bottleneck, we introduce a multi-agent framework guided by large-scale knowledge graphs to find sustainable substitutes for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-chemicals currently under intense regulatory scrutiny. Agents in the framework specialize in problem decomposition, evidence retrieval, design parameter extraction, and graph traversal, uncovering latent connections across distinct knowledge pockets to support hypothesis generation. Ablation studies show that the full multi-agent pipeline outperforms single-shot prompting, underscoring the value of distributed specialization and relational reasoning. We demonstrate that by tailoring graph traversal strategies, the system alternates between exploitative searches focusing on domain-critical outcomes and exploratory searches surfacing emergent cross-connections. Illustrated through the exemplar of biomedical tubing, the framework generates sustainable PFAS-free alternatives that balance tribological performance, thermal stability, chemical resistance, and biocompatibility.

Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. This mismatch between evolving domains and static adaptation pipelines highlights the need for efficient, real-time adaptation without costly retraining. In response, we introduce Online Domain-aware Decoding framework (ODD). ODD performs probability-level fusion between a base LLM and a prefix-tree prior, guided by adaptive confidence modulation using disagreement and continuity signals. Empirical evaluation under diverse drift scenarios demonstrates that ODD consistently surpasses LLM-Greedy and LLM-Temp Scaled across all syntactic and semantic NLG metrics.

Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking. Backtracking is prevalent (32% of instances), beneficial (34% accuracy gain over non-backtracking instances), and predominantly directed away from the semantically closest distractor toward the correct answer. The search is adaptive: replacing distractors with implausible alternatives shortens exploration by 54%. Latent reasoning models achieve in activation space what chain-of-thought achieves through words: the ability to be wrong, notice, and recover."}

We identify two limitations in existing benchmarks: (1) They provide limited insights on the representation usefulness of OCL models, and (2) localization and representation usefulness are assessed using disjoint metrics. To address (1), we use instruction-tuned VLMs as evaluators, enabling scalable benchmarking across diverse VQA datasets to measure how well VLMs leverage OCL representations for complex reasoning tasks.

However, existing work on mixed-logit pricing largely focuses on unconstrained settings, limiting its applicability in practice where prices are subject to business or regulatory constraints. We study the constrained pricing problem under multinomial and mixed logit demand models. For the multinomial logit model, corresponding to a single customer segment, we show that the constrained pricing problem admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) via a reformulation based on exponential cone programming, yielding an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in polynomial time. For finite mixed logit models with $T$ customer segments, we reformulate the problem as a bilinear exponential cone program with $O(T)$ bilinear terms. This structure enables a Branch-and-Bound algorithm whose complexity is exponential only in $T$. Consequently, constrained pricing under finite mixtures of logit admits a PTAS when the number of customer segments is bounded.

To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to extract key diagnostic evidence from radiology reports and construct a shared diagnostic evidence space, enabling evidence-aware cross-modal alignment and allowing LGDEA to effectively exploit abundant unpaired medical images and reports, thereby substantially alleviating the reliance on paired data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent and significant improvements on phrase grounding, image--text retrieval, and zero-shot classification, and even rivals pretraining methods that rely on substantial paired data."}

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn)."}

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment."}

Although larger models often yield better task performance and brain alignment, they are increasingly difficult to analyze mechanistically. This raises a fundamental question: what is the minimal model capacity required to capture brain-relevant representations? To address this question, we systematically investigate how constraining model scale and numerical precision affects brain alignment. We compare full-precision LLMs, small language models (SLMs), and compressed variants (quantized and pruned) by predicting fMRI responses during naturalistic language comprehension. Across model families up to 14B parameters, we find that 3B SLMs achieve brain predictivity indistinguishable from larger LLMs, whereas 1B models degrade substantially, particularly in semantic language regions. Brain alignment is remarkably robust to compression: most quantization and pruning methods preserve neural predictivity, with GPTQ as a consistent exception. Linguistic probing reveals a dissociation between task performance and brain predictivity: compression degrades discourse, syntax, and morphology, yet brain predictivity remains largely unchanged. Overall, brain alignment saturates at modest model scales and is resilient to compression, challenging common assumptions about neural scaling and motivating compact models for brain-aligned language modeling."}

However, unlike computer vision tasks where visual fidelity suffices, physical systems require the rigorous reproduction of higher-order statistical moments and thermodynamic quantities. While Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) have emerged as a powerful tool, their standard formulation on Euclidean embedding space is ill-suited for continuous spin systems, where variables inherently reside on a manifold. In this work, we demonstrate that training on the Euclidean space compromises the model's ability to learn the target distribution as it prioritizes to learn the manifold constraints. We address this limitation by proposing the use of Manifold-Aware Score-Based Generative Modeling framework applied to the 64x64 2D XY model (a 4096-dimensional torus). We show that our method estimates the theoretical Boltzmann score with superior precision compared to standard diffusion models. Consequently, we successfully capture the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) phase transition and accurately reproduce second-moment quantities, such as heat capacity without explicit feature engineering. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot generalization to unseen lattice sizes, accurately recovering the physics of variable system scales without retraining.

In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary). We also conduct experiments on LLM-Judges' capability at detecting these errors, through which we demonstrate the challenging nature of our dataset, the robustness of our taxonomy, and the need for future work in this field to enhance LLMs' performance in the same.

Using fMRI recordings from participants viewing full-length movies, we examine how brain regions sensitive to narrative context dynamically represent information over varying timescales and how these neural patterns align with model-derived features. We find that increasing clip duration substantially improves brain alignment for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), whereas unimodal video models show little to no gain. Further, shorter temporal windows align with perceptual and early language regions, while longer windows preferentially align higher-order integrative regions, mirrored by a layer-to-cortex hierarchy in MLLMs. Finally, narrative-task prompts (multi-scene summary, narrative summary, character motivation, and event boundary detection) elicit task-specific, region-dependent brain alignment patterns and context-dependent shifts in clip-level tuning in higher-order regions. Together, our results position long-form narrative movies as a principled testbed for probing biologically relevant temporal integration and interpretable representations in long-context MLLMs."}

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation."}

Based on these novel observations, we formulate join graph inference as a low-rank matrix completion problem and propose Nexus, an end-to-end solution using only metadata. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization algorithm that alternates between low-rank matrix completion and refining join candidate probabilities by leveraging Large Language Models.

PD-VI jointly updates global and local variational parameters in the evidence lower bound in a scalable manner. To further account for heterogeneous loss geometry across different variational parameter blocks, we introduce a block-preconditioned extension, P$^2$D-VI, which adapts the primal-dual updates to the geometry of each parameter block and improves both numerical robustness and practical efficiency. We establish convergence guarantees for both PD-VI and P$^2$D-VI under properly chosen constant step size, without relying on conjugacy assumptions or explicit bounded-variance conditions.

While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, \"dreaming\" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

We show that any differentiable nonconformity score induces a deterministic flow on the output space whose trajectories converge to the boundary of the corresponding conformal prediction set. This leads to a computationally efficient, training-free method for sampling conformal boundaries in arbitrary dimensions. Boundary samples can be reconformalized to form pointwise prediction sets with controlled risk, and mixing across confidence levels yields conformal predictive distributions whose quantile regions coincide exactly with conformal prediction sets. We evaluate the approach on PDE inverse problems, precipitation downscaling, climate model debiasing, and hurricane trajectory forecasting."}

To bridge this gap, we propose DrugR, an LLM-based method that introduces explicit, step-by-step pharmacological reasoning into the optimization process. Our approach integrates domain-specific continual pretraining, supervised fine-tuning via reverse data engineering, and self-balanced multi-granular reinforcement learning. This framework enables DrugR to effectively improve key ADMET properties while preserving the original molecule's core efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that DrugR achieves comprehensive enhancement across multiple properties without compromising structural similarity or target binding affinity. Importantly, its explicit reasoning process provides clear, interpretable rationales for each optimization step, yielding actionable design insights and advancing toward automated, knowledge-driven scientific discovery.

To address this gap, we propose TabRAG, a framework that enables MLLMs to answer queries over large collections of table images.

Interestingly, the by-product of \\textit{competition} for sparsity introduces an extra local \\textit{attraction} and interplay into the evolutionary process: if one competitor has more zero elements, the other competitor's non-zero elements will occupy those positions, even though the less sparse competitor loses to the more sparse competitor in other positions.

In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts.

To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels. It then rectifies the hidden states to preserve evidence-grounded information. Across question answering (QA) and summarization benchmarks, CoRect consistently improves faithfulness and reduces hallucinations compared to strong baselines."}

We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types."}

Collaboration is primarily associated with task crafting, productivity, and satisfaction, at the cost of long-term skill deterioration. Combination of the orientations (high rivalry and high collaboration) reconciles these differences, while boosting the association with the outcomes. Our findings argue for a balanced approach where high levels of rivalry and collaboration are essential to shape work practices and generate outcomes aimed at the long-term success of the job.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection."}

MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search. Extensive experimental results validate that MA-ADV ensures a 100\\% attack success rate with minimal perturbation cost, and also demonstrate enhanced robustness against defenses, underscoring the critical security challenges facing future event-based perception systems."}

Along the way, we identify a sharp geometric contrast. Namely, in doubling spaces, including all finite-dimensional normed spaces, generatability is stable across novelty scales and invariant under equivalent metrics. In general metric spaces, however, generatability can be highly scale-sensitive and metric-dependent; even in the natural infinite-dimensional Hilbert space $\\ell^2$, all notions of generation may fail abruptly as the novelty parameters vary."}

Conversely, tree ensembles dominate tabular data prediction but typically rely on heuristic uncertainty quantification, lacking a principled probabilistic basis for TS. We propose Bayesian Forest Thompson Sampling (BFTS), the first contextual bandit algorithm to integrate Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a fully probabilistic sum-of-trees model, directly into the exploration loop.

In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying their training performance and generalization remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide several insights into such fine-tuning through the lens of linearization. Fine-tuned models are often implicitly encouraged to remain close to the pretrained model. By making this explicit, using an Euclidean distance inductive bias in parameter space, we show that fine-tuning dynamics become equivalent to learning with the positive-definite neural tangent kernel (NTK). We specifically analyze how close the fully linear and the linearized fine-tuning optimizations are, based on the strength of the regularization. This allows us to be pragmatic about how good a model linearization is when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). When linearization is a good model, our findings reveal a strong correlation between the eigenvalue spectrum of the NTK and the performance of model adaptation. Motivated by this, we give spectral perturbation bounds on the NTK induced by the choice of layers selected for fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theory on Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on LLMs. These insights not only characterize fine-tuning but also have the potential to enhance PEFT techniques, paving the way to better informed and more nimble adaptation in LLMs."}

To further improve data efficiency, we introduce alternative preference-native frameworks for I-PRL and T-PRL that directly optimize TM policies from preference data without requiring reward signals nor optimal action labels.Experiments on dueling bandits, navigation, and continuous control tasks demonstrate that ICPRL enables strong in-context generalization to unseen tasks, achieving performance comparable to ICRL methods trained with full reward supervision."}

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods."}

In this attack scenario, malicious commands hidden within untrusted content trick the agent into performing unauthorized actions. Existing defenses can reduce attack success but often suffer from the over-defense dilemma: they deploy expensive, always-on sanitization regardless of actual threat, thereby degrading utility and latency even in benign scenarios. We revisit IPI through a causal ablation perspective: a successful injection manifests as a dominance shift where the user request no longer provides decisive support for the agent's privileged action, while a particular untrusted segment, such as a retrieved document or tool output, provides disproportionate attributable influence. Based on this signature, we propose CausalArmor, a selective defense framework that (i) computes lightweight, leave-one-out ablation-based attributions at privileged decision points, and (ii) triggers targeted sanitization only when an untrusted segment dominates the user intent. Additionally, CausalArmor employs retroactive Chain-of-Thought masking to prevent the agent from acting on ``poisoned'' reasoning traces. We present a theoretical analysis showing that sanitization based on attribution margins conditionally yields an exponentially small upper bound on the probability of selecting malicious actions. Experiments on AgentDojo and DoomArena demonstrate that CausalArmor matches the security of aggressive defenses while improving explainability and preserving utility and latency of AI agents."}

Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), in particular, offers a promising avenue by decomposing complex tasks into specialized subtasks learned by distinct interacting agents, potentially enhancing the ability and efficiency of LLM systems. However, theoretical insights regarding when and why MARL outperforms Single-Agent RL (SARL) remain limited, creating uncertainty in selecting the appropriate RL framework. In this paper, we address this critical gap by rigorously analyzing the comparative sample efficiency of MARL and SARL within the context of LLM. Leveraging the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) framework, we formally define SARL and MARL setups for LLMs, derive explicit sample complexity bounds, and systematically characterize how task decomposition and alignment influence learning efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MARL improves sample complexity when tasks naturally decompose into independent subtasks, whereas dependent subtasks diminish MARL's comparative advantage. Additionally, we introduce and analyze the concept of task alignment, quantifying the trade-offs when enforcing independent task decomposition despite potential misalignments. These theoretical insights clarify empirical inconsistencies and provide practical criteria for deploying MARL strategies effectively in complex LLM scenarios."}

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv.

First, we derive a batch minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm for softmax-gated multinomial-logistic MoE using an explicit quadratic minorizer, yielding coordinate-wise closed-form updates that guarantee monotone ascent of the objective and global convergence to a stationary point (in the standard MM sense), avoiding approximate M-steps common in EM-type implementations.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts."}

This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons.

Noise stability expresses a model's robustness to correlated noise applied to all input coordinates simultaneously. We provide a theoretical analysis of noise stability for single-layer attention and ReLU MLP layers and tackle the multi-layer propagation problem with a covariance interval propagation approach. Building on this theory, we develop a practical noise stability regularization method. Experiments on algorithmic and next-token-prediction tasks show that our regularizer consistently catalyzes grokking and accelerates training by approximately $35\\%$ and $75\\%$ respectively.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

We theoretically show that the implicit bias of gradient descent induces a three-phase learning process-population-dominated, support-vector-dominated unlearning, and support-vector-dominated generalization-during which delayed generalization can arise. Our analysis further relates the emergence of grokking to asymmetries in the data, both in the number of examples per class and in the distribution of support vectors across classes, and yields a characterization of the grokking time. We experimentally validate our theory by planting different distributions of population points and support vectors, and by analyzing accuracy curves and hyperplane dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate that grokking does not require depth or representation learning, and can emerge even in linear models through the dynamics of the bias term."}

While recent benchmarks evaluate correctness in realistic codebases, they largely treat tasks as independent and do not assess whether agents can reuse experience across related problems. As a result, the ability of agents to accumulate, retrieve, and apply prior experience, as well as the efficiency gains from such reuse, remains difficult to measure. We introduce SWE-ContextBench, a benchmark designed to explicitly evaluate experience reuse in programming agents. Built on SWE-Bench Lite, SWE-ContextBench augments 300 base tasks with 99 related tasks derived from real dependency and reference relationships among GitHub issues and pull requests, forming task sequences with shared context. The benchmark evaluates agents along three complementary dimensions: prediction accuracy, time efficiency, and cost efficiency. Using SWE-ContextBench, we study multiple experience reuse settings, including oracle guided and autonomous retrieval, as well as full execution trajectories and compact summaries. Our results show that correctly selected summarized experience improves resolution accuracy and substantially reduces runtime and token cost, particularly on harder tasks. In contrast, unfiltered or incorrectly selected experience provides limited or negative benefits. These findings highlight the importance of experience representation and retrieval quality, and position SWE-ContextBench as a principled benchmark for studying experience reuse in programming agents."}

Stage 1 performs interpretable per-agent failure detection via Taylor-remainder analysis of policy-gradient costs, declaring an initial Patient-0 candidate at the first threshold crossing.

Although near-oracle top-k KV selection can preserve the quality of dense attention while sharply reducing computation and bandwidth, existing sparse methods generally rely on posterior heuristics, i.e., selectors conditioned on observed attention or proxy scores. Such conditioning introduces posterior bias: it tends to distort true token importance and miss salient tokens, thereby impairing long-range reasoning. To tackle this problem, we propose Pre-hoc Sparsity (PrHS), which selects KV entries before attention scoring and provides explicit accuracy control. Let the attention mass of discarded entries be delta (the dropped mass). Through a marginal-to-mutual-information analysis, we derive an upper bound on the mutual-information loss that depends only on the dropped mass. This relation explains failure modes of posterior heuristics and enables verifiable guarantees by controlling the dropped mass in advance. Within PrHS, we instantiate three orthogonal pre-hoc selectors along the axes of time, depth, and layer. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and Mistral families validate PrHS. Across GSM8K and CoQA, PrHS reduces retrieval overhead by over 90%, achieving 3x higher retrieval sparsity than HShare at matched or better accuracy. It incurs under 1% average degradation on LongBench, lowers attention FLOPs by about 15% versus prior sparse baselines, and yields a 9.9x speedup in attention-operator latency and 2.8x higher throughput on NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs than the dense baseline."}

Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency. On state-tracking tasks, we show Thinking States leads to stronger reasoning behavior than CoT, successfully extrapolating to longer sequences than seen during training."}

In ReLU-based models, the activation pattern induced by a given input determines the piecewise-linear region in which the network behaves affinely. Motivated by this geometry, we investigate whether training exhibits a two-timescale behavior: an early stage with substantial changes in activation patterns and a later stage where weight updates predominantly refine the model within largely stable activation regimes. We first prove a local stability property: outside measure-zero sets of parameters and inputs, sufficiently small parameter perturbations preserve the activation pattern of a fixed input, implying locally affine behavior within activation regions. We then empirically track per-iteration changes in weights and activation patterns across fully-connected and convolutional architectures, as well as Transformer-based models, where activation patterns are recorded in the ReLU feed-forward (MLP/FFN) submodules, using fixed validation subsets. Across the evaluated settings, activation-pattern changes decay 3 times earlier than weight-update magnitudes, showing that late-stage training often proceeds within relatively stable activation regimes. These findings provide a concrete, architecture-agnostic instrument for monitoring training dynamics and motivate further study of decoupled optimization strategies for piecewise-linear networks.

JoBS allocates a portion of the optimization budget to learn an LLM performance predictor that predicts how promising a training configuration is from a small number of training steps. The remaining budget is used to perform BO entirely with the predictor, effectively amortizing the cost of running full-training runs.

Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term \"quantum,\" generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schrödinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science."}

Starting from a log-linear edge-weight model, we derive closed-form expressions for the hitting-time probability mass function, its full moment hierarchy, and the observed Fisher information. The Fisher matrix of each seed node turns out to be rank-one, taking the quotient by its null space yields a low-dimensional, globally flat manifold that captures all identifiable directions of the model.

To mitigate these instabilities, we propose a decentralized evaluation framework that enables hardware and parameter diversity through large-scale benchmarking across heterogeneous compute nodes. By leveraging the blockchain-based protocol, the framework incentivizes global contributors to act as independent validators, using a robust reward system to ensure evaluation integrity and discourage dishonest participation. This collective verification transforms evaluation from a \"centralized black box\" into a \"decentralized endorsement\" where multi-party consensus and diverse inference environments yield a more stable, representative metric.

This framework advances upon prior methods, such as BSAFE, by primarily leveraging a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage where models learn to dynamically correct their own generation errors. Through RL with critic feedback on the model's live outputs, LLMs are trained to identify and recover from their actual, emergent safety violations by emitting an efficient \"backtrack by x tokens\" signal, then continuing generation autoregressively. This RL process is crucial for instilling resilience against sophisticated adversarial strategies, including middle filling, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attacks, and decoding parameter manipulations. To further support the acquisition of this backtracking capability, we also propose an enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data generation strategy (BSAFE+). This method improves upon previous data creation techniques by injecting violations into coherent, originally safe text, providing more effective initial training for the backtracking mechanism. Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RLBF significantly reduces attack success rates across diverse benchmarks and model scales, achieving superior safety outcomes while critically preserving foundational model utility."}

The best-known adaptive regret bounds are achieved by Shampoo-like methods, but they require solving a costly quadratic projection subproblem. To address this, we extend the gradient-based prediction scheme to adaptive matrix online learning and cast algorithm design as constructing a family of smoothed potentials for the nuclear norm. We define a notion of admissibility for such smoothings and prove any admissible smoothing yields a regret bound matching the best-known guarantees of one-sided Shampoo. We instantiate this framework with two efficient methods that avoid quadratic projections. The first is an adaptive Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) method using Gaussian stochastic smoothing. The second is Follow-the-Augmented-Matrix-Leader (FAML), which uses a deterministic hyperbolic smoothing in an augmented matrix space. By analyzing the admissibility of these smoothings, we show both methods admit closed-form updates and match one-sided Shampoo's regret up to a constant factor, while significantly reducing computational cost. Lastly, using the online-to-nonconvex conversion, we derive two matrix-based optimizers, Pion (from FTPL) and Leon (from FAML). We prove convergence guarantees for these methods in nonsmooth nonconvex settings, a guarantee that the popular Muon optimizer lacks."}

The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines.

For the Gaussian conditional paths commonly used in practice, we show that the implied sampler is an ODE whose dynamics constitutes a nonparametric, memory-augmented continuous-time dynamical system. The optimal field admits a closed-form expression as a similarity-weighted mixture of instantaneous velocities induced by past transitions, making the dataset dependence explicit and interpretable. This perspective positions neural FM models trained by stochastic optimization as parametric surrogates of an ideal nonparametric solution.

A central bottleneck is representation: hand-crafted flow statistics are efficient but often too lossy, raw-bit encodings can be accurate but are costly, and recent pre-trained embeddings provide transfer but frequently flatten the protocol stack and entangle signals across layers. We observe that real traffic contains substantial redundancy both across network layers and within each layer; existing paradigms do not explicitly identify and remove this redundancy, leading to wasted capacity, shortcut learning, and degraded generalization. To address this, we propose PACC, a redundancy-aware, layer-aware representation framework. PACC treats the protocol stack as multi-view inputs and learns compact layer-wise projections that remain faithful to each layer while explicitly factorizing representations into shared (cross-layer) and private (layer-specific) components. We operationalize these goals with a joint objective that preserves layer-specific information via reconstruction, captures shared structure via contrastive mutual-information learning, and maximizes task-relevant information via supervised losses, yielding compact latents suitable for efficient inference. Across datasets covering encrypted application classification, IoT device identification, and intrusion detection, PACC consistently outperforms feature-engineered and raw-bit baselines.

Existing agent memory systems are typically designed within isolated paradigms (e.g., explicit, parametric, or latent memory) with tightly coupled retrieval methods that hinder cross-paradigm generalization and fusion. In this work, we take a first step toward unifying heterogeneous memory paradigms within a single memory system. We propose MemAdapter, a memory retrieval framework that enables fast alignment across agent memory paradigms. MemAdapter adopts a two-stage training strategy: (1) training a generative subgraph retriever from the unified memory space, and (2) adapting the retriever to unseen memory paradigms by training a lightweight alignment module through contrastive learning. This design improves the flexibility for memory retrieval and substantially reduces alignment cost across paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on three public evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that the generative subgraph retriever consistently outperforms five strong agent memory systems across three memory paradigms and agent model scales. Notably, MemAdapter completes cross-paradigm alignment within 13 minutes on a single GPU, achieving superior performance over original memory retrievers with less than 5% of training compute. Furthermore, MemAdapter enables effective zero-shot fusion across memory paradigms, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for agent memory systems."}

We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency.

This assumption becomes fragile for agents with situational awareness, which may exploitregime leakage-informational cues distinguishing evaluation from deployment-to implement conditional policies such as sycophancy and sleeper agents, which preserve compliance under oversight while defecting in deployment-like regimes. We reframe alignment evaluation as a problem of information flow under partial observability. Within this framework, we show that divergence between evaluation-time and deployment-time behavior is bounded by the mutual information between internal representations and the regime variable. Motivated by this result, we study regime-blind mechanisms: training-time interventions that reduce the extractability of regime information at decision-relevant internal representations via adversarial invariance. We evaluate this approach on a base, open-weight language model across two fully characterized failure modes -scientific sycophancy and temporal sleeper agents. Regime-blind training suppresses regime-conditioned behavior in both evaluated cases without measurable loss of task utility, but with qualitatively different dynamics: sycophancy exhibits a sharp representational and behavioral transition at low intervention strength, whereas sleeper-agent behavior requires substantially stronger pressure and does not exhibit a clean collapse of regime decodability. These results demonstrate that representational invariance is a meaningful but fundamentally limited control lever, whose effectiveness depends on how regime information is embedded in the policy. We argue that behavioral evaluation should be complemented with white-box diagnostics of regime awareness and information flow."}

However, existing RLVR methods utilize rollouts in an indiscriminate and short-horizon manner: responses of heterogeneous quality within each prompt are treated uniformly, and historical rollouts are discarded after a single use. This leads to noisy supervision, poor sample efficiency, and suboptimal policy updates. We address these issues by formulating rollout scheduling in RLVR as a contextual bandit problem and proposing a unified neural scheduling framework that adaptively selects high-value rollouts throughout training. Each rollout is treated as an arm whose reward is defined by the induced performance gain between consecutive optimization steps. The resulting scheduler supports both noise-aware intra-group selection and adaptive global reuse of historical rollouts within a single principled framework. We provide theoretical justification by deriving sublinear regret bounds and showing that enlarging the rollout buffer improves the achievable performance upper bound. Experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in performance and training efficiency across multiple RLVR optimization methods."}

Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models.

Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation.

To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

We challenge this assumption by introducing implicit memory-the ability of a model to carry state across otherwise independent interactions by encoding information in its own outputs and later recovering it when those outputs are reintroduced as input. This mechanism does not require any explicit memory module, yet it creates a persistent information channel across inference requests. As a concrete demonstration, we introduce a new class of temporal backdoors, which we call time bombs. Unlike conventional backdoors that activate on a single trigger input, time bombs activate only after a sequence of interactions satisfies hidden conditions accumulated via implicit memory. We show that such behavior can be induced today through straightforward prompting or fine-tuning.

This is a preprint version. The camera-ready version will be updated soon", "summary": "Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking."}

However, prior work has largely focused on utility and efficiency, leaving the safety risks associated with this sparse architecture underexplored. In this work, we show that the safety of MoE LLMs is as sparse as their architecture by discovering unsafe routes: routing configurations that, once activated, convert safe outputs into harmful ones. Specifically, we first introduce the Router Safety importance score (RoSais) to quantify the safety criticality of each layer's router. Manipulation of only the high-RoSais router(s) can flip the default route into an unsafe one. For instance, on JailbreakBench, masking 5 routers in DeepSeek-V2-Lite increases attack success rate (ASR) by over 4$\\times$ to 0.79, highlighting an inherent risk that router manipulation may naturally occur in MoE LLMs. We further propose a Fine-grained token-layer-wise Stochastic Optimization framework to discover more concrete Unsafe Routes (F-SOUR), which explicitly considers the sequentiality and dynamics of input tokens. Across four representative MoE LLM families, F-SOUR achieves an average ASR of 0.90 and 0.98 on JailbreakBench and AdvBench, respectively. Finally, we outline defensive perspectives, including safety-aware route disabling and router training, as promising directions to safeguard MoE LLMs. We hope our work can inform future red-teaming and safeguarding of MoE LLMs. Our code is provided in https://github.com/TrustAIRLab/UnsafeMoE."}

CauScale improves time efficiency via a reduction unit that compresses data embeddings and improves space efficiency by adopting tied attention weights to avoid maintaining axis-specific attention maps.

CauScale successfully scales to 500-node graphs during training, where prior work fails due to space limitations. Across testing data with varying graph scales and causal mechanisms, CauScale achieves 99.6% mAP on in-distribution data and 84.4% on out-of-distribution data, while delivering 4-13,000 times inference speedups over prior methods.

A key challenge in unsupervised TSAD is that many anomalies are too subtle to exhibit detectable deviation in any single view (e.g., time domain), and instead manifest as inconsistencies across multiple views like time, frequency, and a mixture of resolutions. However, most cross-view methods rely on feature or score fusion and do not enforce analysis-synthesis consistency, meaning the frequency branch is not required to reconstruct the time signal through an inverse transform, and vice versa. In this paper, we present Learnable Fusion of Tri-view Tokens (LEFT), a unified unsupervised TSAD framework that models anomalies as inconsistencies across complementary representations. LEFT learns feature tokens from three views of the same input time series: frequency-domain tokens that embed periodicity information, time-domain tokens that capture local dynamics, and multi-scale tokens that learns abnormal patterns at varying time series granularities. By learning a set of adaptive Nyquist-constrained spectral filters, the original time series is rescaled into multiple resolutions and then encoded, allowing these multi-scale tokens to complement the extracted frequency- and time-domain information. When generating the fused representation, we introduce a novel objective that reconstructs fine-grained targets from coarser multi-scale structure, and put forward an innovative time-frequency cycle consistency constraint to explicitly regularize cross-view agreement. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LEFT yields the best detection accuracy against SOTA baselines, while achieving a 5x reduction on FLOPs and 8x speed-up for training."}

Existing fairness notions for generative models are largely adapted from classification and focus on balancing the probability of generating samples from each sensitive group. We show that such criteria are brittle, as they can be met even when different sensitive groups are modeled with widely varying quality. To address this limitation, we introduce a new fairness definition for generative models, termed as equalized generative treatment (EGT), which requires comparable generation quality across all sensitive groups, with quality measured via a reference f-divergence. We further analyze the trade-offs induced by EGT, demonstrating that enforcing fairness constraints necessarily couples the overall model quality to that of the most challenging group to approximate. This indicates that a simple yet efficient min-max fine-tuning method should be able to balance f-divergences across sensitive groups to satisfy EGT. We validate this theoretical insight through a set of experiments on both image and text generation tasks. We demonstrate that min-max methods consistently achieve fairer outcomes compared to other approaches from the literature, while maintaining competitive overall performance for both tasks."}

We formalize this risk as Retrieval Pivot Risk (RPR) and introduce companion metrics Leakage@k, Amplification Factor, and Pivot Depth (PD) to quantify leakage magnitude and traversal structure.\n  We present seven Retrieval Pivot Attacks that exploit the vector-to-graph boundary and show that adversarial injection is not required: naturally shared entities create cross-tenant pivot paths organically. Across a synthetic multi-tenant enterprise corpus and the Enron email corpus, the undefended hybrid pipeline exhibits high pivot risk (RPR up to 0.95) with multiple unauthorized items returned per query. Leakage consistently appears at PD=2, which we attribute to the bipartite chunk-entity topology and formalize as a proposition.\n  We then show that enforcing authorization at a single location, the graph expansion boundary, eliminates measured leakage (RPR near 0) across both corpora, all attack variants, and label forgery rates up to 10 percent, with minimal overhead. Our results indicate the root cause is boundary enforcement, not inherently complex defenses: two individually secure retrieval components can compose into an insecure system unless authorization is re-checked at the transition point."}

By seamlessly weaving Token-to-Token (T2T) editing into the conventional Mask-to-Token (M2T) scheme, we introduce a joint, configurable threshold-decoding scheme.

In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning.

CompilerKV integrates two key synergistic components: (i) a Head Heterogeneity Table, learned via offline contextual bandits, which assigns head-specific reliability weights to govern functional differences across attention heads explicitly; and (ii) a Risk-Adaptive Threshold Gating mechanism that jointly models attention entropy and local perplexity, transforming prompt-level risk into deployable retention thresholds.

In this paper, we develop principled welfare-based formulations in NNS for realizing diversity across attributes. Our formulations are based on welfare functions -- from mathematical economics -- that satisfy central diversity (fairness) and relevance (economic efficiency) axioms. With a particular focus on Nash social welfare, we note that our welfare-based formulations provide objective functions that adaptively balance relevance and diversity in a query-dependent manner. Notably, such a balance was not present in the prior constraint-based approach, which forced a fixed level of diversity and optimized for relevance. In addition, our formulation provides a parametric way to control the trade-off between relevance and diversity, providing practitioners with flexibility to tailor search results to task-specific requirements. We develop efficient nearest neighbor algorithms with provable guarantees for the welfare-based objectives. Notably, our algorithm can be applied on top of any standard ANN method (i.e., use standard ANN method as a subroutine) to efficiently find neighbors that approximately maximize our welfare-based objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is practical and substantially improves diversity while maintaining high relevance of the retrieved neighbors."}

Drawing on philosophical accounts of emotional expression and social practice, as well as empirical work in affective science and social psychology, I argue that the appeal of such systems rests on a misunderstanding of the social functions of emotional expression. Emotional expressions function not only as read-outs of inner states, but also as tools for coordinating action, enabling moral repair, sustaining interpersonal trust, and supporting collective norms. These functions depend on a background of partial opacity and epistemic friction. When deployed in socially authoritative or evaluative contexts, ideal ERTs threaten this expressive space by collapsing epistemic friction, displacing relational meaning with technology-mediated affective profiles, and narrowing the space for aspirational and role-sensitive expressions. The result is a drift towards affective determinism and ambient forms of affective auditing, which undermine both social cohesion and individual agency. I argue that, although it is intuitive to think that increasing accuracy would legitimise such systems, in the case of ERTs accuracy does not straightforwardly justify their deployment, and may, in some contexts, provide a reason for regulatory restraint. I conclude by defending a function-first regulatory approach that treats expressive discretion and intentional emotional expression as constitutive of certain social goods, and that accordingly seeks to protect these goods from excessive affective legibility."}

To address these limitations, we propose AMEM4Rec, an agentic LLM-based recommender that learns collaborative signals in an end-to-end manner through cross-user memory evolution. AMEM4Rec stores abstract user behavior patterns from user histories in a global memory pool. Within this pool, memories are linked to similar existing ones and iteratively evolved to reinforce shared cross-user patterns, enabling the system to become aware of CF signals without relying on a pre-trained CF model.

As our main result, we prove that the full WL hierarchy cannot, in general, distinguish between satisfiable and unsatisfiable instances. We show that indistinguishability under higher-order WL carries over to practical limitations for WL-bounded solvers that set variables sequentially. We further study the expressivity required for several important families of SAT instances, including regular, random and planar instances. To quantify expressivity needs in practice, we conduct experiments on random instances from the G4SAT benchmark and industrial instances from the International SAT Competition. Our results suggest that while random instances are largely distinguishable, industrial instances often require more expressivity to predict a satisfying assignment."}

Here, we introduce an on-the-fly outlier detection scheme that automatically down-weights noisy samples, without requiring additional reference calculations. By tracking the loss distribution via an exponential moving average, this unsupervised method identifies outliers throughout a single training run. We show that this approach prevents overfitting and matches the performance of iterative refinement baselines with significantly reduced overhead. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated by recovering accurate physical observables for liquid water from unconverged reference data, including diffusion coefficients. Furthermore, we validate its scalability by training a foundation model for organic chemistry on the SPICE dataset, where it reduces energy errors by a factor of three. This framework provides a simple, automated solution for training robust models on imperfect datasets across dataset sizes."}

We train a modified version of the U-net on silver-standard ground truth data using a novel loss function based on the signed-distance transform (SDT). We validate our model both qualitatively and quantitatively using held-out data from the training dataset, as well as an independent external dataset. The brain masks used for evaluation partially or fully include the subarachnoid space, which may introduce bias into the comparison; nonetheless, our model demonstrates strong performance on the held-out test data, achieving a consistent mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.964$\\pm$0.006 and an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 1.4mm$\\pm$0.2mm.

We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state."}

While most BO pipelines begin with uniform random initialization, default hyperparameter values shipped with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn encode implicit expert knowledge and could serve as informative starting points that accelerate convergence. This hypothesis, despite its intuitive appeal, has remained largely unexamined. We formalize the idea by initializing BO with points drawn from truncated Gaussian distributions centered at library defaults and compare the resulting trajectories against a uniform-random baseline. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation spanning three BO back-ends (BoTorch, Optuna, Scikit-Optimize), three model families (Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptrons), and five benchmark datasets covering classification and regression tasks. Performance is assessed through convergence speed and final predictive quality, and statistical significance is determined via one-sided binomial tests. Across all conditions, default-informed initialization yields no statistically significant advantage over purely random sampling, with p-values ranging from 0.141 to 0.908. A sensitivity analysis on the prior variance confirms that, while tighter concentration around the defaults improves early evaluations, this transient benefit vanishes as optimization progresses, leaving final performance unchanged. Our results provide no evidence that default hyperparameters encode useful directional information for optimization. We therefore recommend that practitioners treat hyperparameter tuning as an integral part of model development and favor principled, data-driven search strategies over heuristic reliance on library defaults."}

A popular strategy is model-based policy evaluation, which estimates a model from data to infer counterfactual outcomes. This strategy is known to produce unwarrantedly optimistic estimates of the true benefit due to the winner's curse. We searched the recent literature on data-driven decision-making, identifying a sample of 55 papers published in the Management Science in the past decade; all but two relied on this flawed methodology. Several common justifications are provided: (1) the estimated models are accurate, stable, and well-calibrated, (2) the historical data uses random treatment assignment, (3) the model family is well-specified, and (4) the evaluation methodology uses sample splitting. Unfortunately, we show that no combination of these justifications avoids the winner's curse. First, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that the winner's curse can cause large, spurious reported benefits even when all these justifications hold. Second, we perform a simulation study based on the recent and consequential data-driven refugee matching problem. We construct a synthetic refugee matching environment (calibrated to closely match the real setting) but designed so that no assignment policy can improve expected employment compared to random assignment. Model-based methods report large, stable gains of around 60% even when the true effect is zero; these gains are on par with improvements of 22-75% reported in the literature.

Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures.

The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

Timely detection is critical as symptoms can escalate rapidly. Early recognition enables simple interventions such as descent, oxygen, or medication, and prompt treatment can save lives by significantly lowering the risk of severe complications. Although conventional machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to identify altitude sickness using physiological signals, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, they often struggle to balance predictive performance with low hardware demands. In contrast, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) remains under-explored for this task with limited biomedical features, where it may offer a compelling alternative to existing classification models. Its vector symbolic framework is inherently suited to hardware-efficient design, making it a strong candidate for low-power systems like wearables. Leveraging lightweight computation and efficient streamlined memory usage, HDC enables real-time detection of altitude sickness from physiological parameters collected by wearable devices, achieving accuracy comparable to that of traditional ML models. We present AMS-HD, a novel system that integrates tailored feature extraction and Hadamard HV encoding to enhance both the precision and efficiency of HDC-based detection. This framework is well-positioned for deployment in wearable health monitoring platforms, enabling continuous, on-the-go tracking of acute altitude sickness."}

In this paper, we propose a new robust learning framework for regression NNs based on the $β$-divergence (also known as the density power divergence) which we call `rRNet'. It applies to a broad class of regression NNs, including models with non-smooth activation functions and error densities, and recovers the classical maximum likelihood learning as a special case. The rRNet is implemented via an alternating optimization scheme, for which we establish convergence guarantees to stationary points under mild, verifiable conditions. The (local) robustness of rRNet is theoretically characterized through the influence functions of both the parameter estimates and the resulting rRNet predictor, which are shown to be bounded for suitable choices of the tuning parameter $β$, depending on the error density. We further prove that rRNet attains the optimal 50\\% asymptotic breakdown point at the assumed model for all $β\\in(0, 1]$, providing a strong global robustness guarantee that is largely absent for existing NN learning methods.

Prior work has explored correlating local policies via shared randomness, sometimes in the form of a correlation device, as a mechanism to assist in decentralized decision-making. In contrast, this work introduces the first framework for training MARL agents to exploit shared quantum entanglement as a coordination resource, which permits a larger class of communication-free correlated policies than shared randomness alone. This is motivated by well-known results in quantum physics which posit that, for certain single-round cooperative games with no communication, shared quantum entanglement enables strategies that outperform those that only use shared randomness. In such cases, we say that there is quantum advantage. Our framework is based on a novel differentiable policy parameterization that enables optimization over quantum measurements, together with a novel policy architecture that decomposes joint policies into a quantum coordinator and decentralized local actors. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we first show that we can learn, purely from experience, strategies that attain quantum advantage in single-round games that are treated as black box oracles. We then demonstrate how our machinery can learn policies with quantum advantage in an illustrative multi-agent sequential decision-making problem formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP)."}

Based on this finding, we propose Dr. MAS, a simple and stable RL training recipe for multi-agent LLM systems. Dr. MAS uses an agent-wise remedy: normalizing advantages per agent using each agent's own reward statistics, which calibrates gradient scales and dramatically stabilizes training, both theoretically and empirically. Beyond the algorithm, Dr. MAS provides an end-to-end RL training framework for multi-agent LLM systems, supporting scalable orchestration, flexible per-agent LLM serving and optimization configs, and shared resource scheduling of LLM actor backends.

We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors.

Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation.

Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics."}

While allocation policies aim to maximize population-level outcomes, current approaches often fail to account for the dynamic arrival of organs and the composition of waitlisted candidates, thereby hampering efficiency. The United States is transitioning from rigid, rule-based allocation to more flexible data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for non-myopic policy optimization in general online matching relying on potentials, a concept originally introduced for kidney exchange. We develop scalable and accurate ways of learning potentials that are higher-dimensional and more expressive than prior approaches. Our approach is a form of self-supervised imitation learning: the potentials are trained to mimic an omniscient algorithm that has perfect foresight. We focus on the application of heart transplant allocation and demonstrate, using real historical data, that our policies significantly outperform prior approaches -- including the current US status quo policy and the proposed continuous distribution framework -- in optimizing for population-level outcomes. Our analysis and methods come at a pivotal moment in US policy, as the current heart transplant allocation system is under review. We propose a scalable and theoretically grounded path toward more effective organ allocation."}

Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality.

In a follow-up lab study (n = 40), we examined how multimodal communication (speech and gestures) changed during physical collaboration. Pairs used augmented reality to isolate their partner's hand and voice; one participant viewed a 3D virtual tower and sent instructions to the other, who built the physical tower. Participants became faster and more accurate by establishing linguistic and gestural abstractions and using cross-modal redundancy to emphasize key changes from previous interactions.

We evaluate six attack settings (M0-M5) against three detector families (RoBERTa, FastDetectGPT, and Binoculars) at the security-relevant 1% false positive rate operating point.

Critically, attacks transfer to a held-out detector family not seen during training, revealing shared architectural vulnerabilities rather than detector-specific brittleness. We additionally conduct LLM-based quality evaluation via Likert scoring, analyze detector score distributions to explain why evasion succeeds, and provide per-detector AUROC with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results expose significant robustness gaps in current AI-text detection and establish StealthRL as a principled adversarial evaluation protocol.

We propose a framework for evaluating goal-directedness that integrates behavioural evaluation with interpretability-based analyses of models' internal representations. As a case study, we examine an LLM agent navigating a 2D grid world toward a goal state. Behaviourally, we evaluate the agent against an optimal policy across varying grid sizes, obstacle densities, and goal structures, finding that performance scales with task difficulty while remaining robust to difficulty-preserving transformations and complex goal structures. We then use probing methods to decode the agent's internal representations of the environment state and its multi-step action plans. We find that the LLM agent non-linearly encodes a coarse spatial map of the environment, preserving approximate task-relevant cues about its position and the goal location; that its actions are broadly consistent with these internal representations; and that reasoning reorganises them, shifting from broader environment structural cues toward information supporting immediate action selection. Our findings support the view that introspective examination is required beyond behavioural evaluations to characterise how agents represent and pursue their objectives."}

In this work, we first formalize this misalignment and prove that rotary position embedding (RoPE) is mathematically incapable of representing non-affine temporal warping. To address this, we propose Symplectic Positional Embeddings (SyPE), a learnable encoding framework derived from Hamiltonian mechanics. SyPE strictly generalizes RoPE by extending the rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(2)$ to the symplectic group $\\mathrm{Sp}(2,\\mathbb{R})$, modulated by a novel input-dependent adaptive warp module. By allowing the attention mechanism to adaptively dilate or contract temporal coordinates end-to-end, our approach captures locally varying periodicities without requiring pre-defined warping functions. We implement this mechanism in StretchTime, a multivariate forecasting architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness on datasets exhibiting non-stationary temporal dynamics."}

To address this, we propose a weighted loss objective for neural networks that combines node-wise imbalance weighting with focal weighting components, the latter leveraging modern quantification of ensemble uncertainties. By emphasizing rare nodes rather than rare observations (data points), and focusing on uncertain nodes for each model output distribution during training, we observe improvements in recall by up to a factor of five on benchmark datasets, along with statistically significant gains in $F_{1}$ score.

ARO accelerates LLM training by performing normed steepest descent in a rotated coordinate system, where the rotation is determined by a novel norm-informed policy.

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

Although phishing email defenses have improved a lot, attackers continue to abuse attachments, enabling malicious content to bypass security measures.

To address this gap, we generated CIC-Trap4Phish, a multi-format dataset containing both malicious and benign samples across five categories commonly used in phishing campaigns: Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PDF files, HTML pages, and QR code images.

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance. (7) Scaling traces/views improves robustness ($+11.8$ points from $5$ to $14$ traces), yet targeted exposure to hard conditions can substitute for scale. (8) Using multiple ID environments broadens coverage and strengthens weak cases (urban OOD $60.6\\% \\rightarrow 70.1\\%$) with a small ID drop; single-ID preserves peak performance but in a narrow domain. These results yield actionable design rules for OOD-robust driving policies."}

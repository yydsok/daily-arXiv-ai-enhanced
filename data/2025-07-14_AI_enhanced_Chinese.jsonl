This method converts audio\ninto discrete \"spectrogram tokens\" by clustering Mel-spectrograms using Faiss\nK-means and then learns high-quality contextual embeddings for these tokens in\nan unsupervised manner with a Word2Vec skip-gram model. For classification,\nembeddings within a 5-second window are averaged and passed to a linear model.\nWith a projected inference time of 6 minutes for a 700-minute test set, the\nSTSG approach achieved a final ROC-AUC public score of 0.559 and a private\nscore of 0.520, demonstrating the viability of fast tokenization approaches\nwith static embeddings for bioacoustic classification.

In this\nwork, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion\nmodeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a\npre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process\ndirectly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically\ncoherent reconstruction of missing audio.

A\nfundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding,\nwhich determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a\n(sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all\npossible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic\nknowledge.

While recent work has shown that structured\ndialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated\nideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,\nwe conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific\nideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,\nand dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and\nfeasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where\none agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative\nimprovement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the\ninteraction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the\ndiversity of generated ideas.

However, because of the limited quality and\nquantity of temporally-aligned audio-text pairs, existing T2A methods struggle\nto handle the complex text prompts that contain precise timing control, e.g.,\n\"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s\". Recent works have explored data augmentation\ntechniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable\ntiming-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is\nstill limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled\nT2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled\nlong-form T2A generation, e.g., \"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping\nat 0s-24s\".

Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and\nAggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent\nComposition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.\nExtensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art\ntiming-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is\ncomparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates\ncomparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and\npaves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF).

By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

This combination of curated data and advanced training allows\nM2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,\nshowcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "M2-Reasoning-7B\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff08294.2K\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "M2-Reasoning-7B\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u3002", "conclusion": "M2-Reasoning-7B\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We find strong and consistent\nprioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,\nacross most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping\nfactors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical\ndiscourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between\npolitical \"bias\" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against\nconflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals\nthat fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through\nboth self-report and empirical testing.

As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in\nthe reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.\nWe train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects\nand {\\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in\nboth Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot\nhandover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective\nrepresentation for the human-to-robot handover task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6f14\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u95f4\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u91cd\u5efa\u4eba\u7c7b-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572816\u79cd\u5bb6\u5ead\u7269\u54c1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "H2RH-SGS\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b-\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ea4\u63a5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Therefore, either model may require input size\nreduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.\nNevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise\ntraining or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on\nhigher resolutions.

To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Krul\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u8f6eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316KV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u6062\u590d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9759\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9884\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u65e0\u6c14\u6ce1\u6062\u590d\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u3002", "result": "TTFT\u51cf\u5c111.5x-2.68x\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c111.33x-2.35x\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "Krul\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Although clinicians visually observe movement\nimpairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure\nmovement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical\nmeasurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or\nearlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics\nLaboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for\ndata collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this\ndata. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,\nclinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of\nour system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle\nerrors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,\nlower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to\nbeing easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability\nand were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals\nundergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a\ncommon patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics\ncorrelated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical\nintervention than the patient-reported outcomes.

However,\nthe improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering\ncharacteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target\ndetection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain.

While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating\noptimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline\nto extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region\nsegmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.\nTo ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling\nstrategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid\n(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion\nconsistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,\nthereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In\naddition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively\nrefine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video\ngeneration.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation\nquality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian\nwhile with 150 FPS inference speed.

However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on\nsingle cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across\ncancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis\nmodels often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,\ndespite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address\nthis, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for\nMultimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer\ntype can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded\nfeatures from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To\ntackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information\nRebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE).

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs.

Low-light enhancement improves\nimage quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or\ngeometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual\nquality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,\nconstrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain\nadaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a\ngeneralized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,\nwhich we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm\nimproves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of\nlow-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to\noptimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance.

Two primary\nstrategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on\nground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a\nlarger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear\ncomparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under\npractical conditions is needed.\n  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of\ndifferent sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a\nstrong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model.

However, distilling from a teacher of the same\ncapacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain\ntasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy\nbased on available teacher models.

Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,\nMDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each\nclass, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.\nHowever, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash\ncenters, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may\ndegrade retrieval performance.\n  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the\nidea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of\nsemantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those\nof unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a\nthree-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic\nstructure.\n  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities\nbetween classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to\nvarying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to\ngenerate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing\na minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.\nFinally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to\nconvert images into binary hash codes.\n  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public\ndatasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.\nSpecifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%\nin MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art\nmethods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08SHC\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u54c8\u5e0c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u5316\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7c7b\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6SHC\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u54c8\u5e0c\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u54c8\u5e0c\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSHC\u5728MAP@100\u3001MAP@1000\u548cMAP@ALL\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.26%\u30017.62%\u548c11.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "SHC\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u54c8\u5e0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs.

In tax consulting\npractice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime\ncandidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of\ntax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and\nwell-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a\nconsiderable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for\nenhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation\n(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and\nreal-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the\nbest configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to\nsupport tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial\nanalyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to\nthe sensitivity of the legal domain.

Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face\nseveral limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA\nsequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high\ncomputational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are\ninefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of\ntwo subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing\n(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant\nspecies.

The first,\ncarried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies\non pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are\navailable. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often\nself-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to\nseveral models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their\nmost preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is\ntested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual\nuse cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged\nthat combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over\nmulti-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing\ngoal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation.

Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,\napplying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using\nholistic images.

To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided\nFeature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),\nwhich simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student\ndistillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion\npatterns into feature representation while transferring the purified\ndiscriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch\nthrough reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware\nVision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern\nembeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding\nocclusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature\nErasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent\nis employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that\ncontain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and\nsubstitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature\ncontamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.\nAfterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch\neffectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust\nrepresentation regardless of the interference of occlusions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faOGFR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u906e\u6321\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u906e\u6321\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u591a\u6837\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u906e\u6321\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u64e6\u9664\u51c0\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u3002", "result": "OGFR\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u906e\u6321\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "OGFR\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u51c0\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits\nvolumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images.

However,\nexisting approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of\nheterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of\nthis setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous\nKnowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate\nprediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server\nupdates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge\ndistillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that\nwhile correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across\nclients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This\nsuggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified\nsamples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional\nknowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model\nfixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update\nthe global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The\nserver update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a\ntheoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech).

However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on\nparameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and\ndegrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited\nadaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration\nframeworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time\nKG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge\ngraph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion\nwithout any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns.

However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of\nan autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited\nwhen combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to\ndynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,\nwhich combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This\nstructure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal\nmemory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time\nto maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion\nNetwork (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion\nfeatures from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV\nfeatures with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal\nfeature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which\ncaptures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features.

Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively.

However, the non-differentiable and\ninflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each\ntoken activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures\nexhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple\nconsecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity\npattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,\nend-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques\n(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nMoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment\ntechniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and\nRMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both\ntoken-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training\nobjectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,\nwe implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and\nspeculative decoding for the first time.

Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy.

We investigate the framework of AI-Native RAN and present its\nthree essential capabilities to shed some light on the standardization\ndirection; namely, AI-driven RAN processing/optimization/automation, reliable\nAI lifecycle management (LCM), and AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) provisioning. The\nstandardization of AI-Native RAN, in particular the Day 1 features, including\nan AI-Native 6G RAN architecture, were proposed. For validation, a large-scale\nfield trial with over 5000 5G-A base stations have been built and delivered\nsignificant improvements in average air interface latency, root cause\nidentification, and network energy consumption with the proposed architecture\nand the supporting AI functions. This paper aims to provide a Day 1 framework\nfor 6G AI-Native RAN standardization design, balancing technical innovation\nwith practical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e866G\u79fb\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2dAI\u539f\u751f\u65e0\u7ebf\u63a5\u5165\u7f51\uff08RAN\uff09\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Day 1\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bd5\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u521d\u5c31\u539f\u751f\u96c6\u6210AI/ML\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5176\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c5G\u4e2dAI\u4ec5\u4e3a\u9644\u52a0\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ece2G\u52305G\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u8fd0\u8425\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51faAI-Native RAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5904\u7406/\u4f18\u5316/\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7ba1\u7406\u548cAI\u5373\u670d\u52a1\uff08AIaaS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc75000\u591a\u4e2a5G-A\u57fa\u7ad9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u3001\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8282\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a6G AI-Native RAN\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86Day 1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning\nsystems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote\nand non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR\nsystems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral\ninformation across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nConsequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the\nbiochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests.

A key challenge in\nlong-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the\ncomposition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across\nrecording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit\nalignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require\ntest-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across\nsessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In\nthis work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural\nTransformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on\nunordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel\ncontext-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers\nunit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording\nsessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows\nfew-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from\nthe test session. To further promote model robustness to population\nvariability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for\niBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training.

However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "DHDA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u7ebf\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u6b21\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5347\u7ea7\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "DHDA\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u5c42\u6b21\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5212\u5206\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5904\u7406\u5168\u5c40\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u4e0b\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u6b65\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u5b9a\u671f\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cDHDA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5408\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DHDA\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u7f6e\u6027\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

This is a tricky question to answer in general, as any function\nmatching the outputs on those examples can in principle be a correct\nextrapolant. We argue that a \"good\" extrapolant should follow certain kinds of\nrules, and here we study a particularly appealing criterion for rule-following\nin list functions: that the function should behave predictably even when\ncertain elements are removed. In functional programming, a standard way to\nexpress such removal operations is by using a filter function. Accordingly, our\npaper introduces a new semantic class of functions -- the filter equivariant\nfunctions. We show that this class contains interesting examples, prove some\nbasic theorems about it, and relate it to the well-known class of map\nequivariant functions. We also present a geometric account of filter\nequivariants, showing how they correspond naturally to certain simplicial\nstructures. Our highlight result is the amalgamation algorithm, which\nconstructs any filter-equivariant function's output by first studying how it\nbehaves on sublists of the input, in a way that extrapolates perfectly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u2014\u2014\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u8f93\u5165/\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u5219\u9075\u5faa\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6620\u5c04\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6784\u9020\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u5305\u542b\u6709\u8da3\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u5355\u7eaf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b8c\u7f8e\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b49\u53d8\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002"}}

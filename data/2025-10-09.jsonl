This transparency also opens a promising\ndirection: multiple reasoners can directly collaborate on each other's thinking\nwithin a shared trajectory, yielding better inference efficiency and\nexploration. A key prerequisite, however, is the ability to assess the\nusefulness and build on another model's partial thinking -- we call this\noff-trajectory reasoning. Our paper investigates a critical question: can\nstandard solo-reasoning training pipelines deliver desired off-trajectory\nbehaviors? We propose twin tests that capture the two extremes of the\noff-trajectory spectrum, namely Recoverability, which tests whether LLMs can\nbacktrack from \"distractions\" induced by misleading reasoning traces, and\nGuidability, which tests their ability to build upon correct reasoning from\nstronger collaborators. Our study evaluates 15 open-weight LLMs (1.5B-32B) and\nreveals a counterintuitive finding -- \"stronger\" LLMs on benchmarks are often\nmore fragile under distraction. Moreover, all models tested fail to effectively\nleverage guiding steps from collaborators on problems beyond their inherent\ncapabilities with solve rates remaining under 9.2%. Finally, we conduct control\nstudies to isolate the effects of three factors in post-training on these\nbehaviors: the choice of distillation teacher, the use of RL, and data\nselection strategy. Our results provide actionable insights for training\nnatively strong reasoning collaborators; e.g., we find that suboptimal\nrecoverability behaviors of teacher models are transferred to distilled\nstudents even if the distillation trajectories are correct. Taken together,\nthis work lays the groundwork for evaluating multi-model collaborations in\nshared reasoning trajectories and highlights the limitations of off-the-shelf\nreasoning LLMs."}

It synthesizes agentic\nsearch trajectories that exhibit these four behaviors and integrates them into\nthe agentic search model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), followed by\nstandard reinforcement learning (RL).

Our approach\ncombines (1) semantic embeddings from a LoRA-fine-tuned LLaMA 3, which capture\npragmatic incongruity and discourse-level cues of sarcasm, and (2) prosodic\nexemplars retrieved via a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) module, which\nprovide expressive reference patterns of sarcastic delivery. Integrated within\na VITS backbone, this dual conditioning enables more natural and contextually\nappropriate sarcastic speech. Experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms baselines in both objective measures and subjective evaluations,\nyielding improvements in speech naturalness, sarcastic expressivity, and\ndownstream sarcasm detection."}

Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for\ndaily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is\ndiagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.\n  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.\nEffective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly\ninteracting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires\nreliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins\nof highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively\nunderstood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI\nmodels with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge\nextends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these\nsettings before assuming broader decision-making roles.\n  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient\nself-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual\nlimits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized\narchitecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents\nrepresenting the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent\ncovers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical\nresults on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing\napplications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable\nself-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments\ncompared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced\nreproducibility in detail."}

However, these methods enhance the reasoning process but\noverlook the decision-making process. This paper investigates decision-making\nin fine-grained emotion recognition through prototype theory. We show that ICL\nrelies on similarity matching between query representations and emotional\nprototypes within the model, where emotion-accurate representations are\ncritical.

Assessments using metrics such as precision (85.20%),\nrecall (87.30%), coverage (92.18%), graph consistency (82.50%), novelty\ndetection (40.28%), and expert validation (89.50%) affirm its robustness and\ncoherence.

We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the\npenultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the\noverparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding\ngeneralization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to\nrepresentations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse\nthan random features. This indicates that training on random labels drives\nnetworks much beyond lazy learning, as weights adapt to encode labels\ninformation."}

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain. Although initially designed for a decentralized learning network, using\nperformance forecasting for prediction combination may be useful in any\nsituation where predictive rather than reactive model weighting is needed."}

Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the\nfollower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain\nrange and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and\nits line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the\nprescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a\nhemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly\nmaps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the\nfollower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control\nsurface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control\nsubsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based\nbackstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set,\nwhere Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's\nbearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability\nanalysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict\nconstraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The\nproposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation\nmismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by\ntransitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set\nwhen the leader aggressively maneuvers.

We revisit the environment\nitself. We propose Markovian Thinking, a paradigm in which the policy advances\nreasoning while conditioning on a constant-size state, decoupling thinking\nlength from context size. As an immediate consequence this yields linear\ncompute with constant memory. We instantiate this idea with Delethink, an RL\nenvironment that structures reasoning into fixed-size chunks. Within each\nchunk, the model thinks as usual; at the boundary, the environment resets the\ncontext and reinitializes the prompt with a short carryover. Through RL, the\npolicy learns to write a textual state near the end of each chunk sufficient\nfor seamless continuation of reasoning after reset. Trained in this\nenvironment, an R1-Distill 1.5B model reasons in 8K-token chunks yet thinks up\nto 24K tokens, matching or surpassing LongCoT-RL trained with a 24K budget.\nWith test-time scaling, Delethink continues to improve where LongCoT plateaus.\nThe effect of linear compute is substantial: we empirically estimate at 96K\naverage thinking length LongCoT-RL costs 27 H100-months vs. 7 for Delethink.\nAnalysis at RL initialization shows off-the-shelf reasoning models (1.5B-120B)\noften sample Markovian traces zero-shot across diverse benchmarks, providing\npositive samples that make RL effective at scale.

In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020\nIEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework compared to standard training strategies."}

In this paper we show that the core insight to address this\nquestion stems from recasting Thompson Sampling as an online optimization\nalgorithm.

The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs.

Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies.

The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the\nchallenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading\napproach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong\nzero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and\noccluded scenarios."}

This study investigates the central paradox of the\nsuccess of this student-led civilian uprising: how state violence, intended to\nquell dissent, ultimately fueled the movement's victory. We employ a\nmixed-methods approach. First, we develop a qualitative narrative of the\nconflict's timeline to generate specific, testable hypotheses. Then, using a\ndisaggregated, event-level dataset, we employ a multi-method quantitative\nanalysis to dissect the complex relationship between repression and\nmobilisation. We provide a framework to analyse explosive modern uprisings like\nthe July Revolution. Initial pooled regression models highlight the crucial\nrole of protest momentum in sustaining the movement. To isolate causal effects,\nwe specify a Two-Way Fixed Effects panel model, which provides robust evidence\nfor a direct and statistically significant local suppression backfire effect.\nOur Vector Autoregression (VAR) analysis provides clear visual evidence of an\nimmediate, nationwide mobilisation in response to increased lethal violence. We\nfurther demonstrate that this effect was non-linear. A structural break\nanalysis reveals that the backfire dynamic was statistically insignificant in\nthe conflict's early phase but was triggered by the catalytic moral shock of\nthe first wave of lethal violence, and its visuals circulated around July 16th.\nA complementary machine learning analysis (XGBoost, out-of-sample R$^{2}$=0.65)\ncorroborates this from a predictive standpoint, identifying \"excessive force\nagainst protesters\" as the single most dominant predictor of nationwide\nescalation. We conclude that the July Revolution was driven by a contingent,\nnon-linear backfire, triggered by specific catalytic moral shocks and\naccelerated by the viral reaction to the visual spectacle of state brutality."}

Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,\nwhich can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,\nMySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using\nunit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful\nprompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having\na 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception\ncapabilities with 89 human attackers.

To address this gap, we introduce\nAudioMarathon, a benchmark designed to evaluate both understanding and\ninference efficiency on long-form audio. AudioMarathon provides a diverse set\nof tasks built upon three pillars: long-context audio inputs with durations\nranging from 90.0 to 300.0 seconds, which correspond to encoded sequences of\n2,250 to 7,500 audio tokens, respectively, full domain coverage across speech,\nsound, and music, and complex reasoning that requires multi-hop inference.

We also study acceleration techniques and analyze the trade-offs\nof token pruning and KV cache eviction. The results show large gaps across\ncurrent LALMs and highlight the need for better temporal reasoning and\nmemory-efficient architectures.

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer\nLearning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and\nannotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding\nspace. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability\nvia class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),\nyielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering\nand weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that\nachieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly\ndoubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,\nheuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond\nfaces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations\nand subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first\nrecognizability-aware body recognition assessment.

Attempts at\nsegmentation of inflammatory skin disease such as psoriasis perform markedly\nworse on darker skin tones, potentially impeding equitable care. We assembled a\npsoriasis dataset sourced from six public atlases, annotated for Fitzpatrick\nskin type, and added detailed segmentation masks for every image. Reference\nmodels based on U-Net, ResU-Net, and SETR-small are trained without tone\ninformation. On the tuning split we sweep decision thresholds and select (i)\nglobal optima and (ii) per Fitzpatrick skin tone optima for Dice and binary\nIoU. Adapting Fitzpatrick specific thresholds lifted segmentation performance\nfor the darkest subgroup (Fitz VI) by up to +31 % bIoU and +24 % Dice on UNet,\nwith consistent, though smaller, gains in the same direction for ResU-Net (+25\n% bIoU, +18 % Dice) and SETR-small (+17 % bIoU, +11 % Dice). Because\nFitzpatrick skin tone classifiers trained on Fitzpatrick-17k now exceed 95 %\naccuracy, the cost of skin tone labeling required for this technique has fallen\ndramatically.

The\nexisting ones are limited only to simulating one type of service, mainly SSH\nshells. These systems - but also the deception technologies not based on LLMs -\nlack an extensive evaluation that includes human attackers. Generative AI has\nrecently become a valuable asset for cybersecurity researchers and\npractitioners, and the field of cyber-deception is no exception. Researchers\nhave demonstrated how LLMs can be leveraged to create realistic-looking\nhoneytokens, fake users, and even simulated systems that can be used as\nhoneypots. This paper presents an AI-based deception framework called VelLMes,\nwhich can simulate multiple protocols and services such as SSH Linux shell,\nMySQL, POP3, and HTTP. All of these can be deployed and used as honeypots, thus\nVelLMes offers a variety of choices for deception design based on the users'\nneeds. VelLMes is designed to be attacked by humans, so interactivity and\nrealism are key for its performance. We evaluate the generative capabilities\nand the deception capabilities. Generative capabilities were evaluated using\nunit tests for LLMs. The results of the unit tests show that, with careful\nprompting, LLMs can produce realistic-looking responses, with some LLMs having\na 100% passing rate. In the case of the SSH Linux shell, we evaluated deception\ncapabilities with 89 human attackers. The results showed that about 30% of the\nattackers thought that they were interacting with a real system when they were\nassigned an LLM-based honeypot. Lastly, we deployed 10 instances of the SSH\nLinux shell honeypot on the Internet to capture real-life attacks. Analysis of\nthese attacks showed us that LLM honeypots simulating Linux shells can perform\nwell against unstructured and unexpected attacks on the Internet, responding\ncorrectly to most of the issued commands."}

Prompts for LLMs generally comprise two components:\nthe \\textit{instruction}, which defines the task or objective, and the\n\\textit{input}, which is tailored to the instruction type. In natural language\ngeneration (NLG) tasks such as machine translation, the \\textit{input}\ncomponent is particularly critical, while the \\textit{instruction} component\ntends to be concise. Existing prompt engineering methods primarily focus on\noptimizing the \\textit{instruction} component for general tasks, often\nrequiring large-parameter LLMs as auxiliary tools.

However, stateless inference often struggles on\nmulti-step tasks due to the absence of persistent state. Moreover,\ntask-specific fine-tuning or instruction-tuning often achieve surface-level\ncode generation but remain brittle on tasks requiring deeper reasoning and\nlong-horizon dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose stateful\nmulti-agent evolutionary search, a training-free framework that departs from\nprior stateless approaches by combining (i) persistent inference-time state,\n(ii) adversarial mutation, and (iii) evolutionary preservation. We demonstrate\nits effectiveness in automated unit test generation through the generation of\nedge cases. We generate robust edge cases using an evolutionary search process,\nwhere specialized agents sequentially propose, mutate, and score candidates. A\ncontroller maintains persistent state across generations, while evolutionary\npreservation ensures diversity and exploration across all possible cases. This\nyields a generalist agent capable of discovering robust, high-coverage edge\ncases across unseen codebases. Experiments show our stateful multi-agent\ninference framework achieves substantial gains in coverage over stateless\nsingle-step baselines, evaluated on prevalent unit-testing benchmarks such as\nHumanEval and TestGenEvalMini and using three diverse LLM families - Llama,\nGemma, and GPT. These results indicate that combining persistent inference-time\nstate with evolutionary search materially improves unit-test generation."}

Theoretical and experimental\nresults show that the presented methods can achieve performance comparable to\nthat with supervised calibration, at the expenses of a moderate degradation in\nperformance guarantees and computational efficiency."}

A major roadblock to viable fusion power is understanding\nplasma turbulence, which significantly impairs plasma confinement, and is vital\nfor next-generation reactor design. Plasma turbulence is governed by the\nnonlinear gyrokinetic equation, which evolves a 5D distribution function over\ntime. Due to its high computational cost, reduced-order models are often\nemployed in practice to approximate turbulent transport of energy. However,\nthey omit nonlinear effects unique to the full 5D dynamics. To tackle this, we\nintroduce GyroSwin, the first scalable 5D neural surrogate that can model 5D\nnonlinear gyrokinetic simulations, thereby capturing the physical phenomena\nneglected by reduced models, while providing accurate estimates of turbulent\nheat transport.GyroSwin (i) extends hierarchical Vision Transformers to 5D,\n(ii) introduces cross-attention and integration modules for latent\n3D$\\leftrightarrow$5D interactions between electrostatic potential fields and\nthe distribution function, and (iii) performs channelwise mode separation\ninspired by nonlinear physics. We demonstrate that GyroSwin outperforms widely\nused reduced numerics on heat flux prediction, captures the turbulent energy\ncascade, and reduces the cost of fully resolved nonlinear gyrokinetics by three\norders of magnitude while remaining physically verifiable. GyroSwin shows\npromising scaling laws, tested up to one billion parameters, paving the way for\nscalable neural surrogates for gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence."}

We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across\nseven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:\nViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and\n1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The\nprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2\nachieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to\n512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and\nImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across\ninitializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16.

Resolution-related gains\nwere most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In\nchest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the\nbenefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical\nupper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest\nperformance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,\nthese findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for\nchest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting\nsubtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care\nsettings."}

In\nthis work, we propose models of covert verifiable learning in quantum learning\ntheory and realize them without computational hardness assumptions for remote\ndata access scenarios motivated by established quantum data advantages. We\nconsider two privacy notions: (i) strategy-covertness, where the eavesdropper\ndoes not gain information about the learner's strategy; and (ii)\ntarget-covertness, where the eavesdropper does not gain information about the\nunknown object being learned. We show: Strategy-covert algorithms for making\nquantum statistical queries via classical shadows; Target-covert algorithms for\nlearning quadratic functions from public quantum examples and private quantum\nstatistical queries, for Pauli shadow tomography and stabilizer state learning\nfrom public multi-copy and private single-copy quantum measurements, and for\nsolving Forrelation and Simon's problem from public quantum queries and private\nclassical queries, where the adversary is a unidirectional or i.i.d.\nancilla-free eavesdropper.

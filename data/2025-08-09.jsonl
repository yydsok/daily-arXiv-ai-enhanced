To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose PA-RNet (Perturbation-Aware Reasoning Network for\nMultimodal Time Series Forecasting), a robust multimodal forecasting framework.\nPA-RNet features a perturbation-aware projection module and a cross-modal\nattention mechanism to effectively separate noise from the textual embeddings\nwhile maintaining semantically meaningful representations, thereby enhancing\nthe model's generalization ability. Theoretically, we establish the Lipschitz\ncontinuity of PA-RNet with respect to textual inputs and prove that the\nproposed perturbation module can reduce expected prediction error, offering\nstrong guarantees of stability under noisy conditions.

In real-world event logs, the acquisition of data can be\nnon-trivial (e.g., due to the execution of manual activities and related manual\nrecording or to issues in collecting, for each event, all its attributes), and\noften may end up with events recorded with some missing information. Standard\napproaches to the problem of trace (or log) reconstruction either require the\navailability of a process model that is used to fill missing values by\nleveraging different reasoning techniques or employ a Machine Learning/Deep\nLearning model to restore the missing values by learning from similar cases. In\nrecent years, a new type of Deep Learning model that is capable of handling\ninput data encoded as graphs has emerged, namely Graph Neural Networks. Graph\nNeural Network models, and even more so Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks,\noffer the advantage of working with a more natural representation of complex\nmulti-modal sequences like the execution traces in Process Mining, allowing for\nmore expressive and semantically rich encodings.\n  In this work, we focus on the development of a Heterogeneous Graph Neural\nNetwork model that, given a trace containing some incomplete events, will\nreturn the full set of attributes missing from those events.

Based on these insights, we\nintroduce Attention-Driven Reranking (AttnRank), a two-stage framework that (i)\nestimates a model's intrinsic positional attention preferences using a small\ncalibration set, and (ii) reorders retrieved documents or few-shot examples to\nalign the most salient content with these high-attention positions.

The defusing of\nthe situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the\nconflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a\ncustom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test\nparticipants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can\nsuccessfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of\nthe confrontation.

However, complementary to this perspective, meta-reviewing is a\ndecision-making process that requires weighing reviewer arguments and placing\nthem within a broader context. Prior research has demonstrated that\ndecision-makers can be effectively assisted in such scenarios via dialogue\nagents. In line with this framing, we explore the practical challenges for\nrealizing dialog agents that can effectively assist meta-reviewers. Concretely,\nwe first address the issue of data scarcity for training dialogue agents by\ngenerating synthetic data using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on a\nself-refinement strategy to improve the relevance of these dialogues to expert\ndomains. Our experiments demonstrate that this method produces higher-quality\nsynthetic data and can serve as a valuable resource towards training\nmeta-reviewing assistants. Subsequently, we utilize this data to train dialogue\nagents tailored for meta-reviewing and find that these agents outperform\n\\emph{off-the-shelf} LLM-based assistants for this task. Finally, we apply our\nagents in real-world meta-reviewing scenarios and confirm their effectiveness\nin enhancing the efficiency of meta-reviewing.\\footnote{Code and Data:\nhttps://github.com/UKPLab/arxiv2025-meta-review-as-dialog"}

Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained\nnetworks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose\na scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires\ncareful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression\nwith a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).\nWe expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely\nEpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos\nin under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms\nprior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint."}

In most research focused on developing new AV control\nalgorithms (controllers), the performance of these algorithms is assessed\nsolely based on performance metrics such as collision avoidance or lane-keeping\nefficiency, while largely overlooking the human-centred dimensions of\ninteraction with HDVs. This paper proposes a structured evaluation framework\nthat addresses this gap by incorporating metrics grounded in the human-robot\ninteraction literature. The framework spans four key domains: a) interaction\neffect, b) interaction perception, c) interaction effort, and d) interaction\nability. These domains capture both the performance of the AV and its impact on\nhuman drivers around it. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we apply\nit to a case study evaluating how a state-of-the-art AV controller interacts\nwith human drivers in a merging scenario in a driving simulator. Measuring\nHDV-HDV interactions as a baseline, this study included one representative\nmetric per domain: a) perceived safety, b) subjective ratings, specifically how\nparticipants perceived the other vehicle's driving behaviour (e.g.,\naggressiveness or predictability) , c) driver workload, and d) merging success.\nThe results showed that incorporating metrics covering all four domains in the\nevaluation of AV controllers can illuminate critical differences in driver\nexperience when interacting with AVs. This highlights the need for a more\ncomprehensive evaluation approach. Our framework offers researchers,\ndevelopers, and policymakers a systematic method for assessing AV behaviour\nbeyond technical performance, fostering the development of AVs that are not\nonly functionally capable but also understandable, acceptable, and safe from a\nhuman perspective."}

To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel framework for cold-start active preference\nlearning.

Previous research aimed\nat reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps\nderived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language\ntokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this\nprogress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and\ninsufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that\nintroduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning\nmodule with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference."}

In contrast to other state-of-the-art TSFMs, which\nrequire training data across all possible sampling rates to memorize patterns\nat each scale, FlowState inherently adapts its internal dynamics to the input\nscale, enabling smaller models, reduced data requirements, and improved\nefficiency.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Second, to accurately score\nreasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method\nfor reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs\nby systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along\ncurated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical\nrigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other\nbenchmarks.

At present, deep learning time\nseries prediction has become the mainstream method. However, the multi-scale\ntime dynamics and the irregularity of real data lead to the limitations of the\nexisting methods. Therefore, we propose EnergyPatchTST, which is an extension\nof the Patch Time Series Transformer specially designed for energy forecasting.\nThe main innovations of our method are as follows: (1) multi-scale feature\nextraction mechanism to capture patterns with different time resolutions; (2)\nprobability prediction framework to estimate uncertainty through Monte Carlo\nelimination; (3) integration path of future known variables (such as\ntemperature and wind conditions); And (4) Pre-training and Fine-tuning examples\nto enhance the performance of limited energy data sets.

In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a\n96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous\nstate-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times\nfewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three\nout-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when\nfacing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and\ntransitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real\nrobot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when\ninteracting with both sparse and dense crowds.

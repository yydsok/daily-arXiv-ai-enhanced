When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology.

Meanwhile,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face\nsignificant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning\nabilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and\nbeing limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM\n(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node\ndescription, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured\nnatural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which\nencodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained\nlanguage models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared\nto directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph\nrepresentation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a\nshared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph\nFoundation Models.

In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

In this paper, we address\nthese challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a\nknowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and\nhigh-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference\namong heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nwith task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented\nReinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for\nvisual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present\nOptimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large\nlanguage models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of\ntasks in the Minecraft environment.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was\nenhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence."}

However,\nthis approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and\nchanging snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for\nSSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance\nfrom raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision\nTransformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as\nexplicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous\nSSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region\ncharacterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include\nmulti-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,\naugmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target\nvariable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We\nshow that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model\nmatches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's\nability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.\nOur geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous\nregions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic\nsettings.

Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization.

Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

Some notable\ndirections have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image\ndenoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks\nstill lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural\ncomponents that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and\nsubsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by\ndeveloping a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not\nonly the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such\nas positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later\nvariants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts\nbuilding upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap.

Developing accurate and effective\nbotanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'\ninterests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey\nproducts at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.\nTherefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to\naddress this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL\nalgorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel\ntechnique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental\nlearning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)\nalgorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by\nreinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability\ninto neural networks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that\na one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and\nvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined\nweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure\nexplains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high\nsample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely\nspurious.

Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups.

We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that\nthis approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of\nhyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative\nmodels. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face\ndatasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the\nunderlying hyperspherical manifold.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

These errors stem from a\nfundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting\ntheir behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,\nwe outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that\ndynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,\npopulations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to\ndiagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and\nregions, and expand access to medical care."}

This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete\naudio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We\npropose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,\nquantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application\ndomains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,\ndownstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs\nthrough controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,\npractical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance\nfor future research in this rapidly evolving area.

We\nintroduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven\nirregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine\ndistinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,\nconstraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we\nintroduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal\ntime series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.\nIMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text\nfusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both\nrecency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies.

Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style\naudio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by\nhypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM\noperational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio\nintegration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that\nenhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant\ninformation; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations\nexclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring\npropagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently\nintegrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary\nrepresentations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider\nspectrum of audio information.

We begin by describing a broad class of such models --\nstate space models -- as those whose state updates can be computed using the\nclassic parallel prefix scan algorithm with a custom associative aggregation\noperator. We then define a more general class, Prefix-Scannable Models (PSMs),\nby relaxing the state aggregation operator to allow arbitrary (potentially\nnon-associative) functions such as softmax attention. This generalization\nunifies many existing architectures, including element-wise RNNs (e.g., Mamba)\nand linear transformers (e.g., GLA, Mamba2, mLSTM), while also introducing new\nmodels with softmax-like operators that achieve O(1) amortized compute per\ntoken and log(N) memory for sequence length N.

To address this challenge, we propose an\nocclusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked\nautoencoders, termed as HOMAE.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data.

Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art\nbaselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these\nbaselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We\ncomplement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data\ndistributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the\ncandidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this\nconstitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS."}

We\nestablish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,\nefficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary\nstakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of\nexisting interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and\ntransparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving\nthe broader ML community."}

As a result, treatment replanning is often required\nto maintain clinically acceptable treatment quality. However, current manual\nreplanning processes are resource-intensive and time-consuming. We propose a\npatient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT\nreplanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality\nscore addressing competing clinical objectives.

Unlike population-based\napproaches, our framework trains personalized agents for each patient using\ntheir planning CT (Computed Tomography) and augmented anatomies simulating\nanatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific\napproach leverages anatomical similarities throughout treatment, enabling\neffective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network\nand Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state\nrepresentations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.\nEvaluation on five HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed both DRL\nagents improved initial plan scores from $120.63 \\pm 21.40$ to $139.78 \\pm\n6.84$ (DQN) and $142.74 \\pm 5.16$ (PPO), surpassing manual replans generated by\na human planner ($137.20 \\pm 5.58$).

However, conventional applications require solving the\nfull reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states,\nwhich poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging.\nIn particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those\nused in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy\nvelocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In\nthis work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates\na pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based\ngenerative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike\ntraditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion\nsampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in\nthe clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity\nmodels. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple\nregularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal\nmodification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation\nand can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality.

To access a\nfull global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or\neye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing\nenvironment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control\nand observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have\ndiscussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.\nIn a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary\nsignificantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects\nof environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image\nshot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the\ncamera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches\nfor the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the\nalgorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the\nsearch policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging\ntechnique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation\naccuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering\nout high-frequency information in the original image.

Existing text-to-texture synthesis\napproaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate\nimages and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,\nthese approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across\nviewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized\ntextures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the\nautoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

We start by giving an example-driven\nintroduction to the Gittins index, then walk through several examples of\nproblems it solves - some optimally, some suboptimally but still with excellent\nperformance. Two practical highlights in the latter category are applying the\nGittins index to Bayesian optimization, and applying the Gittins index to\nminimizing tail latency in queues."}

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight\nproxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the\n\"alignment\" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally\nefficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that\nassigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely\nproportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of\nunlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide\nrigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention\nwhile maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods.

To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling\nlaw offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically\nconstructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly\nbetter fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our\nmethodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions,\ndemonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's\nlaw by reducing extrapolation error by 433\\%. This allows for the reliable\nevaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings,\nenabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently\nextrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides\nnew insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced\ndemands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an\nextensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and\nconfigurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours.

While function spaces are\ntypically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced\nthrough applications in computer vision and natural language processing that\nfocus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental\ndisparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from\nachieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in\nother fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural\nnetworks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate\ndeep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance,\nneural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g.,\nphysical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and\ngeometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful\nengineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing.\nTranslating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator\nlearning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural\noperator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not\ndirectly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In\nthis paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing\npractical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function\nspaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several\npopular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications.\nThis paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the\nsteps to make neural operators work in practice.

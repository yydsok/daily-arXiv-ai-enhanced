When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology.

Meanwhile,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) excel in natural language tasks but face\nsignificant challenges when applied to graphs, including preserving reasoning\nabilities, managing extensive token lengths from rich node attributes, and\nbeing limited to textual-attributed graphs (TAGs) and a single level task. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Node-Oriented Conceptualization LLM\n(NOCL), a novel framework that leverages two core techniques: 1) node\ndescription, which converts heterogeneous node attributes into structured\nnatural language, extending LLM from TAGs to non-TAGs; 2) node concept, which\nencodes node descriptions into compact semantic embeddings using pretrained\nlanguage models, significantly reducing token lengths by up to 93.9% compared\nto directly using node descriptions. Additionally, our NOCL employs graph\nrepresentation descriptors to unify graph tasks at various levels into a\nshared, language-based query format, paving a new direction for Graph\nFoundation Models.

In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

In this paper, we address\nthese challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a\nknowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and\nhigh-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference\namong heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture\nwith task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented\nReinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for\nvisual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present\nOptimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft.

While speech face alignment is well established, the broader\ndynamics linking emotionally expressive speech to regional facial and hand\nmotion remains critical for gaining a deeper insight into how emotional and\nbehavior cues are communicated in real interactions. Further modulating the\ncoordination is the structure of conversational exchange like sequential turn\ntaking, which creates stable temporal windows for multimodal synchrony, and\nsimultaneous speech, often indicative of high arousal moments, disrupts this\nalignment and impacts emotional clarity. Understanding these dynamics enhances\nrealtime emotion detection by improving the accuracy of timing and synchrony\nacross modalities in both human interactions and AI systems. This study\nexamines multimodal emotion coupling using region specific motion capture from\ndyadic interactions in the IEMOCAP corpus. Speech features included low level\nprosody, MFCCs, and model derived arousal, valence, and categorical emotions\n(Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral), aligned with 3D facial and hand marker\ndisplacements. Expressive activeness was quantified through framewise\ndisplacement magnitudes, and speech to gesture prediction mapped speech\nfeatures to facial and hand movements. Nonoverlapping speech consistently\nelicited greater activeness particularly in the lower face and mouth. Sadness\nshowed increased expressivity during nonoverlap, while anger suppressed\ngestures during overlaps. Predictive mapping revealed highest accuracy for\nprosody and MFCCs in articulatory regions while arousal and valence had lower\nand more context sensitive correlations. Notably, hand speech synchrony was\nenhanced under low arousal and overlapping speech, but not for valence."}

However,\nthis approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and\nchanging snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for\nSSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance\nfrom raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision\nTransformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as\nexplicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous\nSSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region\ncharacterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include\nmulti-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,\naugmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target\nvariable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse\nhorizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We\nshow that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model\nmatches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's\nability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.\nOur geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous\nregions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic\nsettings.

Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization.

Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations.

Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing\nand sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling\nintroduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make\nprobabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.\nBuilding on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,\ninspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of\nlanguage models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language\nmodels possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain\nconditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,\nsuch as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling\ntemperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous\nmethods for eliciting human-like priors.

This is suboptimal because resampling can\nintroduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present\nRealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is\nan extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a\nnetwork to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after\nwhich a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation\nthat aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM\noutputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we\nleverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that\nencodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By\ntransforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the\ntraining process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be\nresolution-agnostic.

Some notable\ndirections have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image\ndenoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks\nstill lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural\ncomponents that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and\nsubsequent variants.

Developing accurate and effective\nbotanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'\ninterests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey\nproducts at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.\nTherefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to\naddress this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL\nalgorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel\ntechnique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental\nlearning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)\nalgorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by\nreinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability\ninto neural networks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face\ninherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language\nitself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by\nsemantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as\nan expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent\n(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This\ncomputational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms\npossess meaning in and of themselves is flawed.

Our experiments across\nfive prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and\nhallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally\nrelated. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we\nthen formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that\na one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and\nvalue matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined\nweights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the\nimplicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the\nnuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure\nexplains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high\nsample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely\nspurious.

Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple\nplausible dance interpretations.

This approach goes beyond implicit\nlearning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both\nmore diverse and better aligned with musical styles.

The problem intensifies in intersectional\nanalyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving\nrise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more\ngranular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable\nestimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals,\nprecluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.\n  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing\nframework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical\ndecision.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures\nwith directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing\nangular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that\nthis approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of\nhyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative\nmodels. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face\ndatasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the\nunderlying hyperspherical manifold.

We propose a two-stage\npipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net\nbased segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping\nsignals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the\nprimary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into\na time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an\nadaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG\nformats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our\napproach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained\nsegmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior\nperformance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both\nnon-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping\nsignals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson\nCorrelation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,\nrespectively, for the baseline.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher\nsuccess rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a\nprior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with\nmore vertices with up to 58.5% improvement.

While prior work has primarily\nfocused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on\nunlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods\noften suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To\naddress this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And\nRetention via Data attribution.

Training-free methods like diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic\nalgorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,\ne.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques\nveer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,\nwe devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism\nand reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the\ncamera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches\nfor the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this\nalgorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is\nunreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy\navailable for moving the camera.

Moreover, the\npredefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the\nobject's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized\nfrom different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In\nTexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that\nrepeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within\nthe diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on\nthese resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a\nfew training images restricts the model's original ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an\nperformance preservation loss to mitigate this issue.

Training-free methods like diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic\nalgorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,\ne.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques\nveer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,\nwe devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism\nand reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\\hat{x}$\nproduced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the\nsolution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting\nfrom $\\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for\nDPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box\nin-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling.

We first define\nthe conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the\ninstruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal\npoint process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected\nsubset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing\neasy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs\nshow that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language\nbenchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected\nsubset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user\ninstructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction\nratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\\% and CUDA latency\nby 78\\%, while maintaining 94\\% of the original accuracy.

It allows\nLMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential\ncollision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes\nonly the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning\nwhen the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans\npossess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical\nenvironments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as\ninductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace\nhuman agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing\nvisual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not\ninductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual\nquestion answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.\nInPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision\nevents in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting\n13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited\nparametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive\nphysical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal\nphysical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from\nlanguage bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the\ntrustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs."}

Additionally, a more\ncritical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable\nspatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an\nLLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user\npreferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph\nconstruction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver\nfor optimal route finding.

To this end, we introduce a\nbenchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and\ndecentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking\nmethodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the\nvariances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training\nscales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to\ncentralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the\nissues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model\naccuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections\nin a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is\nsurprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model\nreplicas.

A common way of controlling such\nmanipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control\nparameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is\nrepresentative of the real operational conditions. However, when dealing with\nmanipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a\nstatic force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping\nfrom the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively,\nmeasurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust\ntendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement\nor state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not\nalways accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables\ntension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics.\nWe develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment,\nhyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics\niterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length\nor tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a\ntraditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the\nmethod when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the\npossibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic\ninput only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension\nmeasurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems."}

Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration).

In this context, the development of remote\nautonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained\nsignificant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate\ndiagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the\nreactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for\nanomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key\nchallenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to\nreal-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking\nand characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,\nwhile recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL\noutputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised\nmethodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for\ncharacterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area\nmonitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also\nlocalization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of\nincreasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms\noperate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature\nattention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,\nwhile time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities\noccur, thus enabling localization.

Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality\nof images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make\nuse of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to\ngenerate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an\nimage--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,\ncompositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both\nLLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset\nof human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use\ninter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to\nunderstand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating\nthe same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image\nquality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality\nattributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for\neach axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect\nto all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic\nimage), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are\nmuch more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,\nthese findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal\nLLMs perceive images."}

To tackle these, we\nproposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on\nfoundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the\nclient-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized\naggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific\ntask vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level\nfine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise\npersonalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or\ninterest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark\ndatasets."}

For this reason, in this work, we\npropose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis\nto improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within\ntransactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of\ntraditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled\ninformation that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.\nTherefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves\n(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage\nlarge node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying\nautomatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels.

We evaluate our technique using 350\ncybersecurity-specific prompts, demonstrating substantial improvements in\njailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\\% (no refinements) to 62\\%\nafter three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\\textcent~per\nprompt. Comparative A/B testing across nine different LLM evaluators confirms\nthat outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more\nmalicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that\ngenerated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal\ndeployment typically requires target-specific fine-tuning. With eventual\nimproved harmful code generation, these results highlight critical\nvulnerabilities in current LLM safety frameworks."}

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,\nsynthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets\n(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale\nregression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6).

We further show\nthat the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust\ntarget representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a\nsingle A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be\nperformed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented\ndata-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks.

Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this \"silver-standard\"\ndataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by\nspecialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale\nsupervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that\nsupervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language\nalignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D\nResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\\% AUC for zero-shot\ndiagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements\nin cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\\% for\nreport-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to\nfacilitate {\\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems.

At the core of StyleSculptor is a\nnovel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a\ndynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for\nstyle-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling\nstable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate\nsemantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature\nselection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of\n3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,\nallowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With\nSD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or\nboth-guided features to steer the 3D generation process.

Such deformation\noften originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence\nvary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods\nfor modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are\ncomputationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.\nNeural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently\nsolving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in\naccelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct\napplication across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical\nlimitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on\ndiffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural\noperator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are\nexplicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural\nnetwork constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is\nthen trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of\ndeformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the\ndiffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient\nprediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The\nproposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient\nsolution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying\ngeometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and\nmulti-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency\nacross parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and\nfeatures."}

To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,\nhigh-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100\ngrams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates\na real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A\nnear-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate\nan instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model\nquality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently\ncapture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data\nacquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline\nemploys a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)\napproach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)\nlocation data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this\narchitecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs.

However,\nprior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend\non expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended\nactive exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and\nplausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose\nActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through\nmulti-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is\nused for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively\npredicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and\noptimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL\nefficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail\nor likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.\nExperiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL\nbaselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training\nmethods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art\napproaches despite using a smaller model.

By combining\nadvanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based\nhedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes\nportfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone\nmodels, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management\nin complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper\ncontributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio\noptimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options\ntrading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature."}

Recent advances\nin diffusion models have made it possible to generate realistic, high-quality\ntabular data, but they may also memorize training records and leak sensitive\ninformation. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) exploit this vulnerability by\ndetermining whether a record was used in training. While MIAs have been studied\nin images and text, their use against tabular diffusion models remains\nunderexplored despite the unique risks of structured attributes and limited\nrecord diversity. In this paper, we introduce MIAEPT, Membership Inference\nAttack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data, a novel black-box attack\nspecifically designed to target tabular diffusion models. MIA-EPT constructs\nerrorbased feature vectors by masking and reconstructing attributes of target\nrecords, disclosing membership signals based on how well these attributes are\npredicted. MIA-EPT operates without access to the internal components of the\ngenerative model, relying only on its synthetic data output, and was shown to\ngeneralize across multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models. We validate\nMIA-EPT on three diffusion-based synthesizers, achieving AUC-ROC scores of up\nto 0.599 and TPR@10% FPR values of 22.0% in our internal tests. Under the MIDST\n2025 competition conditions, MIA-EPT achieved second place in the Black-box\nMulti-Table track (TPR@10% FPR = 20.0%).

However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal\nmisalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes\ncontaining multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets\nare frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature\nAlignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a\nhierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),\nKnowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS).

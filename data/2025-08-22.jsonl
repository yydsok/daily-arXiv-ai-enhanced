Extends our earlier framework on\n  hierarchical narrative graphs with a semantic normalization module", "summary": "Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured\nrepresentations that capture events, characters, and their relations across\nmultiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often\nsuffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are\nlabeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the\neffectiveness of reasoning and generalization.\n  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical\nnarrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of\nnarrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically\nrelated actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based\nclustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic\ncategories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.\n  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109\ndataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.\nPreliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action\nretrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic\nnormalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic\ntransparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward\nscalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative\nunderstanding."}

The proposed ASCMamba employs a DenseEncoder to extract\nhierarchical spectral features from spectrograms, followed by a dual-path Mamba\nblocks that capture long-range temporal and frequency dependencies using\nMamba-based state space models. In addition, we present a two-step\npseudo-labeling mechanism to generate more reliable pseudo-labels. Results show\nthat the proposed system outperforms all the participating teams and achieves a\n6.2% improvement over the baseline.

However, learned policies often still lack reliability and\nexhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure\npattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.\nthey cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain\nstates. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For\ninstance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the\nrobot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an\nobject or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon\ne.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.\nHowever, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other\nways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of\nidling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement.

SemToken can be seamlessly\nintegrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.\nExperiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103\nand LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\\times$ reduction in token\ncount and $1.9\\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity\nand downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a\npromising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large\nlanguage models."}

Our analysis\nreveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse\nin the output feature space.

Although 3DGS compression methods\nhave been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two\nlimitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to\nthe megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or\nextensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene\nchanges after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We\nevaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.\nExperimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene\nchanges. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub."}

The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the\ninformation of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the\ndetection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do\nnot consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global\ntemporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant\ncomputation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference\nspeed."}

This\npaper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task\nlearning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach\naims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among\nsimilar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.\nWe introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection\nof task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities\nand variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for\nefficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar\ntasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.\nExperimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,\nparticularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations.

This approach provides a principled way to apply\nreversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a\ndiffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network\nintegrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction\n(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core\nobject regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this\nprinciple to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;\nand a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a\nfinal refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion\nmodel that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,\nharnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration\nwithout the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process.

LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}

In this article, we propose a U-Statistic-based random forest\napproach, referred to as Forest U-Test, for genetic association studies with\nquantitative traits. Through simulation studies, we showed that the Forest\nU-Test outperformed existing methods. The proposed method was also applied to\nstudy Cannabis Dependence CD, using three independent datasets from the Study\nof Addiction: Genetics and Environment. A significant joint association was\ndetected with an empirical p-value less than 0.001. The finding was also\nreplicated in two independent datasets with p-values of 5.93e-19 and 4.70e-17,\nrespectively."}

In this study, we present\nDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch\nnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain\ngeneralization without retraining the entire model.

A substantial portion of SLMs' memory\nfootprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and\nlanguage modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static\nvocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,\none-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage\nand a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles\nunderlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,\nthe observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any\nsingle inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between\nvocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce\nVocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that\naddresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a\nhybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling\non-demand loading of vocabulary components.

Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results\nsuggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly\nleveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI\nin medical imaging."}

The framework standardizes\nevaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds,\nlogbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces,\nPareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving\ncomparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from\norchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators\nto be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be\nused for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We\nillustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an\nenterprise decision-making setting.

In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.\nUsing a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show\nthat the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories\nthat correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have\nordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the\npresence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can\nperform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that\nthe physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.\nInteractive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available\nat https://memorynca.github.io/2D."}

Neural simulators have\nemerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,\ncapable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world\ndata; however, existing neural simulators typically require\napplication-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or\nenvironments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.\nIn this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural\nsimulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We\npropose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models\nfor predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact\nconstraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers\nin an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant\nsimulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an\ninterchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We\nconduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and\naccurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and\nenvironment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural\nengine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from\nreal-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality."}

Traditional approaches treat these\ndimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated\nmethods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about\noptimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel\nframework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently\noptimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual\ngradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization\nby providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration\ninterdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that\nproposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an\nOptimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving\nfeedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT\ndemonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,\nachieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability."}

However, in real-world applications, users are often\npresented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where\nindependent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices\nand hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group\ninference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of\nsamples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment\nproblem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected\nto optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity\n(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively\nprune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to\nscale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsignificantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent\nsampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes\nacross a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image\nprompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple\noutputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples."}

We uncover several key concerns that strongly question the prospect of\nusing current LLMs as decision-making assistants: (1) a large variance in\nresponses between LLMs, (2) within a single LLM, responses show fragility to\nminor variations in prompt phrasing (e.g., reformulating the question in the\nfirst person can considerably alter the decision), (3) LLMs can accept\nunreasonably low rewards for major inconveniences (e.g., 1 Euro to wait 10\nhours), and (4) LLMs can reject monetary gains where no discomfort is imposed\n(e.g., 1,000 Euro to wait 0 minutes). These findings emphasize the need for\nscrutiny of how LLMs value human inconvenience, particularly as we move toward\napplications where such cash-versus-comfort trade-offs are made on users'\nbehalf."}

This paper introduces DiLQR, a framework that\nfacilitates differentiation through iLQR, allowing it to serve as a trainable\nand differentiable module, either as or within a neural network. A novel aspect\nof this framework is the analytical solution that it provides for the gradient\nof an iLQR controller through implicit differentiation, which ensures a\nconstant backward cost regardless of iteration, while producing an accurate\ngradient. We evaluate our framework on imitation tasks on famous control\nbenchmarks. Our analytical method demonstrates superior computational\nperformance, achieving up to 128x speedup and a minimum of 21x speedup compared\nto automatic differentiation. Our method also demonstrates superior learning\nperformance ($10^6$x) compared to traditional neural network policies and\nbetter model loss with differentiable controllers that lack exact analytical\ngradients. Furthermore, we integrate our module into a larger network with\nvisual inputs to demonstrate the capacity of our method for high-dimensional,\nfully end-to-end tasks.

In\neach stage, only one encoder is trained while the other is frozen, reducing\nmemory demands. To handle temporal misalignment, STPT avoids frame-by-frame\nalignment across videos. The spatial stage learns from alignments within each\nvideo and its temporally consistent augmentations. The temporal stage then\nmodels relationships between video embeddings. Our method efficiently handles\nlong videos and temporal variability. On 23,027 time-lapse videos (3,286\nlabeled), STPT achieves the highest AUC of 0.635 (95% CI: 0.632-0.638) compared\nto baselines, with limited computational resources."}

To address diverse decoding needs, we\nutilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a\ndiffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced\npre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and\ngeneration. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses\nexisting multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater\ntraining efficiency.

Recently,\nneural-based SQA models have been actively developed for speech samples\nproduced by text-to-speech or voice conversion, with a primary focus on\ntraining mean opinion score (MOS) prediction models. The quality of each speech\nsample may not be consistent across the entire duration, and it remains unclear\nwhich segments of the speech receive the primary focus from humans when\nassigning subjective evaluation for MOS calculation. We hypothesize that when\nhumans rate speech, they tend to assign more weight to low-quality speech\nsegments, and the variance in ratings for each sample is mainly due to\naccidental assignment of higher scores when overlooking the poor quality speech\nsegments. Motivated by the hypothesis, we analyze the VCC2018 and BVCC\ndatasets.

However, current\nfine-tuning methods use a syntax learning paradigm that forces agents to\nreproduce exactly the ground truth action strings, leading to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) vulnerability. To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions. Specifically,\ninspired by the programming language theory, we define the action semantics for\nApp agents as the state transition induced by the action in the user interface.\nWith this insight, ASL employs a novel SEmantic Estimator (SEE) to compute a\nsemantic reward to train the App agents in generating actions aligned with the\nsemantics of ground truth actions, even when the syntactic forms differ. To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer\ncollisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to better maintain the\nrelative positioning among dancers. Additionally, we incorporate a\ndistance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within\nplausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we\nintroduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design\na Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For\nlong group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling\nstrategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional\ninformation into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder\nlayer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and\ncoherent group dance generation."}

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video.

However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

In this paper, we propose a novel two-level framework\n(i.e., Consensus Inference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (CI-HRL)),\nwhich delegates target localization to a high-level policy, while adopting a\nlow-level policy to manage obstacle avoidance, navigation, and formation.\nSpecifically, in the high-level policy, we develop a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning module, Consensus-oriented Multi-Agent Communication\n(ConsMAC), to enable agents to perceive global information and establish\nconsensus from local states by effectively aggregating neighbor messages.\nMeanwhile, we leverage an Alternative Training-based Multi-agent proximal\npolicy optimization (AT-M) and policy distillation to accomplish the low-level\ncontrol. The experimental results, including the high-fidelity\nsoftware-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, validate that CI-HRL provides a\nsuperior solution with enhanced swarm's collaborative evasion and task\ncompletion capabilities."}

This new Federated Neural Additive Models (FedNAMs)\napproach merges the advantages of NAMs, where individual networks concentrate\non specific input features, with the decentralized approach of federated\nlearning, ultimately producing interpretable analysis results. This integration\nenhances privacy by training on local data across multiple devices, thereby\nminimizing the risks associated with data centralization and improving model\nrobustness and generalizability. FedNAMs maintain detailed, feature-specific\nlearning, making them especially valuable in sectors such as finance and\nhealthcare. They facilitate the training of client-specific models to integrate\nlocal updates, preserve privacy, and mitigate concerns related to\ncentralization. Our studies on various text and image classification tasks,\nusing datasets such as OpenFetch ML Wine, UCI Heart Disease, and Iris, show\nthat FedNAMs deliver strong interpretability with minimal accuracy loss\ncompared to traditional Federated Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The research\ninvolves notable findings, including the identification of critical predictive\nfeatures at both client and global levels. Volatile acidity, sulfates, and\nchlorides for wine quality.

However, recent studies show that\nSDE models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which are often limited to\nunrealistic settings, e.g., digital perturbations on separate stereo views in\nstatic scenes, restricting their real-world applicability. This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks. Motivated\nby this, we present PatchHunter, the first optimization-free adversarial patch\nattack against SDE. PatchHunter formulates patch generation as a reinforcement\nlearning-driven search over a structured space of visual patterns crafted to\ndisrupt SDE assumptions.\n  We validate PatchHunter across three levels: the KITTI dataset, the CARLA\nsimulator, and real-world vehicle deployment.

To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output.

To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF.

Despite this\ncommon practice, it remains unknown whether edits persist after fine-tuning or\nwhether they are inadvertently reversed. This question has fundamental\npractical implications. For example, if fine-tuning removes prior edits, it\ncould serve as a defence mechanism against hidden malicious edits. Vice versa,\nthe unintended removal of edits related to bias mitigation could pose serious\nsafety concerns. We systematically investigate the interaction between model\nediting and fine-tuning in the context of T2I diffusion models, which are known\nto exhibit biases and generate inappropriate content. Our study spans two T2I\nmodel families (Stable Diffusion and FLUX), two sota editing techniques, and\nthree fine-tuning methods (DreamBooth, LoRA, and DoRA). Through an extensive\nempirical analysis across diverse editing tasks and evaluation metrics, our\nfindings reveal a trend: edits generally fail to persist through fine-tuning,\neven when fine-tuning is tangential or unrelated to the edits.

To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of\nprograms representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source\ncode and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We\nfind evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for\ninputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations.\nFirstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code\nrather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can\nproduce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the\nprogram within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the\nprogram in-context via chain-of-thought.

Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess.

Each\ngenerator is then tasked with producing synthetic datasets under two\nconditions: a 1:1 (1,000 rows) and a 1:10 (10,000 rows) input-output ratio.\nEvaluation is conducted using two criteria: statistical similarity, measured\nvia classical statistics and distributional metrics; and predictive utility,\nassessed using a \"Train on Synthetic, Test on Real\" approach with four\nregression models. While statistical similarity remained consistent across\nmodels in both scenarios, predictive utility declined notably in the 1:10 case.\nThe Bayesian Network from Synthicity achieved the highest fidelity in both\nscenarios, while TVAE from SDV performed best in predictive tasks under the\n1:10 setting. Although no significant performance gap was found between the two\nlibraries, SDV stands out for its superior documentation and ease of use,\nmaking it more accessible for practitioners."}

The ONH of one eye was imaged\nunder two conditions: (1) primary gaze and (2) primary gaze with IOP elevated\nto ~35 mmHg via ophthalmo-dynamometry. Glaucoma experts classified the subjects\ninto four categories based on the presence of specific visual field defects:\n(1) superior nasal step (N=26), (2) superior partial arcuate (N=62), (3) full\nsuperior hemifield defect (N=25), and (4) other/non-specific defects (N=124).\nAutomatic ONH tissue segmentation and digital volume correlation were used to\ncompute IOP-induced neural tissue and lamina cribrosa (LC) strains.\nBiomechanical and structural features were input to a Geometric Deep Learning\nmodel. Three classification tasks were performed to detect: (1) superior nasal\nstep, (2) superior partial arcuate, (3) full superior hemifield defect.

In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions.

Specifically, ASTER introduces a new\nResource-aware Spatio-Temporal interaction module (RaST) that adaptively\ncaptures long- and short-term dependencies under dynamic resource conditions,\nproducing context-aware spatiotemporal representations. To directly generate\nactionable decisions, we further design a Preference-oriented decision agent\n(Poda) based on multi-objective reinforcement learning, which transforms\npredictive signals into resource-efficient intervention strategies by deriving\noptimal actions under specific preferences and dynamic constraints.\nExperimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art performance of ASTER in improving both early prediction\naccuracy and resource allocation outcomes across six downstream metrics."}

These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific\ncode-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step\nin constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing\ncode benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are\nprone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could\nresult in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations\nof model capabilities.\n  While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental\ndesigns and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt\nsensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that\nmodifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and\ntheir structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct\nextensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative\nopen-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt\ntemplates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical\nmetrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings\nsuggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in\nperformance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce\ninconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These\ninsights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing\nfuture code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM\ncapabilities."}

To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent\nrepresentation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of\nKAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing\ndynamics.

To\naddress this issue, we propose ReDit (Reward Dithering), a method that dithers\nthe discrete reward signal by adding simple random noise. With this perturbed\nreward, exploratory gradients are continuously provided throughout the learning\nprocess, enabling smoother gradient updates and accelerating convergence. The\ninjected noise also introduces stochasticity into flat reward regions,\nencouraging the model to explore novel policies and escape local optima.\nExperiments across diverse tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency\nof ReDit. On average, ReDit achieves performance comparable to vanilla GRPO\nwith only approximately 10% the training steps, and furthermore, still exhibits\na 4% performance improvement over vanilla GRPO when trained for a similar\nduration. Visualizations confirm significant mitigation of gradient issues with\nReDit. Moreover, theoretical analyses are provided to further validate these\nadvantages."}

An intriguing challenge arises when agents\ninteract with the world as a dynamic data stream and ad-hoc queries from users:\nsupporting knowledge for queries, namely evidence, usually appears\nasynchronously with the arrival time of queries, and agents need to ground\ntheir responses in historical data, present observations, and even future\nstreams. We frame this challenge as Query-Evidence Asynchrony, where user\nqueries and their supporting evidence typically arrive asynchronously in the\nstreaming setting. This setting requires not only strong reasoning capabilities\nbut also the ability to retain past observations and respond to queries with\ntemporal awareness. In this paper, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark that\nevaluates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to handle\ninteraction with streaming data. Further, we present AViLA, Asynchronous\nVideo-Language Agent for streaming data interaction that can handle ad-hoc\nqueries and give time-aware responses. For this purpose, AViLA consists of\nthree key modules: comprehensive memory retention, evidence identification, and\nevidence-grounded trigger, that are designed to maintain a general-purpose\nmemory and respond readily and timely to queries.

Delving into the typical VLM structures, current literatures are\ncategorized into prompt-based, parameter-based and feature-based methods\naccording to the transferred modules. The differences and characteristics in\neach category are furthered summarized and discussed by revisiting the typical\ntransfer learning (TL) settings, providing novel interpretations for TL in the\nera of VLMs. Popular benchmarks for VLM generalization are further introduced\nwith thorough performance comparisons among the reviewed methods. Following the\nadvances in large-scale generalizable pretraining, this survey also discusses\nthe relations and differences between VLMs and up-to-date multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLM), e.g., DeepSeek-VL. By systematically reviewing the\nsurging literatures in vision-language research from a novel and practical\ngeneralization prospective, this survey contributes to a clear landscape of\ncurrent and future multimodal researches."}

However, logical anomalies present a\nparticular difficulty because, while their local features often resemble normal\nsemantics, their global semantics deviate significantly from normal patterns.\nThanks to the generalisation capabilities inherent in neural networks, these\nabnormal semantic features can propagate through low-dimensional bottlenecks.\nThis ultimately allows the decoder to reconstruct anomalous images with\nmisleading fidelity. To tackle the above challenge, we propose a novel\nnormality prior guided multi-semantic fusion network for unsupervised anomaly\ndetection. Instead of feeding the compressed bottlenecks to the decoder\ndirectly, we introduce the multi-semantic features of normal samples into the\nreconstruction process.

Existing defenses have focused,\nimplicitly or explicitly, on single-patch attacks, leaving their sensitivity to\nthe number of patches as an open question or rendering them computationally\ninfeasible or inefficient against attacks consisting of multiple patches in the\nworst cases. In this work, we propose SpaNN, an attack detector whose\ncomputational complexity is independent of the expected number of adversarial\npatches. The key novelty of the proposed detector is that it builds an ensemble\nof binarized feature maps by applying a set of saliency thresholds to the\nneural activations of the first convolutional layer of the victim model. It\nthen performs clustering on the ensemble and uses the cluster features as the\ninput to a classifier for attack detection. Contrary to existing detectors,\nSpaNN does not rely on a fixed saliency threshold for identifying adversarial\nregions, which makes it robust against white box adversarial attacks. We\nevaluate SpaNN on four widely used data sets for object detection and\nclassification, and our results show that SpaNN outperforms state-of-the-art\ndefenses by up to 11 and 27 percentage points in the case of object detection\nand the case of image classification, respectively.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces a\nnovel approach that integrates the outputs from various machine learning models\ndirectly with the PyReason framework, an open-world temporal logic programming\nreasoning engine. PyReason's foundation in generalized annotated logic allows\nfor the seamless incorporation of real-valued outputs (e.g., probabilities,\nconfidence scores) from diverse ML models, treating them as truth intervals\nwithin its logical framework. Crucially, PyReason provides mechanisms,\nimplemented in Python, to continuously poll ML model outputs, convert them into\nlogical facts, and dynamically recompute the minimal model, ensuring real-tine\nadaptive decision-making. Furthermore, its native support for temporal\nreasoning, knowledge graph integration, and fully explainable interface traces\nenables sophisticated analysis over time-sensitive process data and existing\norganizational knowledge. By combining the strengths of perception and\nextraction from ML models with the logical deduction and transparency of\nPyReason, we aim to create a powerful system for automating complex processes.\nThis integration finds utility across numerous domains, including\nmanufacturing, healthcare, and business operations."}

To facilitate the training of OmniGen2, we developed\ncomprehensive data construction pipelines, encompassing image editing and\nin-context generation data. Additionally, we introduce a reflection mechanism\ntailored for image generation tasks and curate a dedicated reflection dataset\nbased on OmniGen2. Despite its relatively modest parameter size, OmniGen2\nachieves competitive results on multiple task benchmarks, including\ntext-to-image and image editing. To further evaluate in-context generation,\nalso referred to as subject-driven tasks, we introduce a new benchmark named\nOmniContext. OmniGen2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source\nmodels in terms of consistency. We will release our models, training code,\ndatasets, and data construction pipeline to support future research in this\nfield.

Effective alignment between motion and musical beats\nenhances viewer engagement and visual appeal, particularly in music videos,\npromotional content, and cinematic editing. Existing methods typically depend\non labor-intensive manual cutting, speed adjustments, or heuristic-based\nediting techniques to achieve synchronization. While some generative models\nhandle joint video and music generation, they often entangle the two\nmodalities, limiting flexibility in aligning video to music beats while\npreserving the full visual content. In this paper, we propose a novel and\nefficient framework, termed MVAA (Music-Video Auto-Alignment), that\nautomatically edits video to align with the rhythm of a given music track while\npreserving the original visual content. To enhance flexibility, we modularize\nthe task into a two-step process in our MVAA: aligning motion keyframes with\naudio beats, followed by rhythm-aware video inpainting. Specifically, we first\ninsert keyframes at timestamps aligned with musical beats, then use a\nframe-conditioned diffusion model to generate coherent intermediate frames,\npreserving the original video's semantic content. Since comprehensive test-time\ntraining can be time-consuming, we adopt a two-stage strategy: pretraining the\ninpainting module on a small video set to learn general motion priors, followed\nby rapid inference-time fine-tuning for video-specific adaptation.

Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

To address this, we introduce FilMaster, an end-to-end\nAI system that integrates real-world cinematic principles for\nprofessional-grade film generation, yielding editable, industry-standard\noutputs. FilMaster is built on two key principles: (1) learning cinematography\nfrom extensive real-world film data and (2) emulating professional,\naudience-centric post-production workflows. Inspired by these principles,\nFilMaster incorporates two stages: a Reference-Guided Generation Stage which\ntransforms user input to video clips, and a Generative Post-Production Stage\nwhich transforms raw footage into audiovisual outputs by orchestrating visual\nand auditory elements for cinematic rhythm. Our generation stage highlights a\nMulti-shot Synergized RAG Camera Language Design module to guide the AI in\ngenerating professional camera language by retrieving reference clips from a\nvast corpus of 440,000 film clips. Our post-production stage emulates\nprofessional workflows by designing an Audience-Centric Cinematic Rhythm\nControl module, including Rough Cut and Fine Cut processes informed by\nsimulated audience feedback, for effective integration of audiovisual elements\nto achieve engaging content.

In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'.

Leveraging this framework, we fine-tune open-source\nLLMs, including LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B, to develop Step-Opt--a model that\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as NL4OPT, MAMO, and\nIndustryOR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of\nStep-Opt, especially in addressing complex OR tasks, with a notable 17.01\\%\nimprovement in micro average accuracy on difficult problems. These findings\nhighlight the effectiveness of combining structured validation with gradual\nproblem refinement to advance the automation of decision-making processes using\nLLMs.The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/samwu-learn/Step."}

The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve\nthe Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with\nconsistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image\nsynthesis.

What drives this stability in the\ngeneration? We investigate this phenomenon through the lens of probability\nconcentration in the model's output distribution. To quantify this\nconcentration, we introduce the Branching Factor (BF) -- a token-invariant\nmeasure of the effective number of plausible next steps during generation. Our\nempirical analysis reveals two key findings: (1) BF often decreases as\ngeneration progresses, suggesting that LLMs become more predictable as they\ngenerate. (2) alignment tuning substantially sharpens the model's output\ndistribution from the outset, reducing BF by nearly an order of magnitude\n(e.g., from 12 to 1.2) relative to base models. This stark reduction helps\nexplain why aligned models often appear less sensitive to decoding strategies.\nBuilding on this insight, we find this stability has surprising implications\nfor complex reasoning. Aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT) models (e.g.,\nDeepSeek-distilled models), for instance, leverage this effect; by generating\nlonger reasoning chains, they push generation into later, more deterministic\n(lower BF) stages, resulting in more stable outputs. We hypothesize that\nalignment tuning does not fundamentally change a model's behavior, but instead\nsteers it toward stylistic tokens (e.g., \"Sure\") that unlock low-entropy\ntrajectories already present in the base model. This view is supported by\nnudging experiments, which show that prompting base models with such tokens can\nsimilarly reduce BF. Together, our findings establish BF as a powerful\ndiagnostic for understanding and controlling LLM outputs - clarifying how\nalignment reduces variability, how CoT promotes stable generations, and how\nbase models can be steered away from diversity."}

This mixed-methods systematic review\nexamines such techniques, offering evidence-based guidance for researchers and\npractitioners. Following PRISMA guidelines and Kitchenham's systematic review\nmethodology, we analyzed 8 empirical studies published between 2021-2024\ninvestigating bias mitigation strategies. Our findings reveal five primary\nprompt engineering approaches: cultural prompting, affective priming,\nself-debiasing techniques, structured multi-step pipelines, and\nparameter-optimized continuous prompts. Although all approaches show potential\nfor reducing bias, effectiveness varied substantially across studies and bias\ntypes. Evidence suggests that certain bias types may be more resistant to\nprompt-based mitigation than others. Structured multi-step pipelines\ndemonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, achieving up to 87.7% reduction\nin bias, though they require greater technical expertise. Cultural prompting\noffers broader accessibility with substantial effectiveness. These results\nunderscore the accessibility of prompt engineering for mitigating cultural bias\nwithout requiring access to model parameters.

The problem arises in various research fields, including\nmachine learning, statistics, and theoretical computer science, and has broad\nreal-world applications.\n  This paper presents new $\\mathsf{NP} $-hardness results for low-rank matrix\ncompletion problems. We show that for every sufficiently large integer $d$ and\nany real number $\\varepsilon \\in [ 2^{-O(d)},\\frac{1}{7}]$, given a partial\nmatrix $A$ with exposed values of magnitude at most $1$ that admits a positive\nsemi-definite completion of rank $d$, it is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard to find a\npositive semi-definite matrix that agrees with each given value of $A$ up to an\nadditive error of at most $\\varepsilon$, even when the rank is allowed to\nexceed $d$ by a multiplicative factor of $O (\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon ^2 \\cdot\n\\log(1/\\varepsilon)} )$. This strengthens a result of Hardt, Meka, Raghavendra,\nand Weitz (COLT, 2014), which applies to multiplicative factors smaller than\n$2$ and to $\\varepsilon $ that decays polynomially in $d$. We establish similar\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness results for the case where the completed matrix is\nconstrained to have a bounded infinity norm (rather than be positive\nsemi-definite), for which all previous hardness results rely on complexity\nassumptions related to the Unique Games Conjecture.

While deep learning has\ndemonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior,\nachieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable\nremains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates\nstructured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).\nSKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function\napproximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual\nsensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable\nquantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent\nrepresentation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of\nKAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing\ndynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the\nNeural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to\nrefine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered\nequations and the predictive accuracy of system responses.

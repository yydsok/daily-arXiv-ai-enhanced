Many MAPF solvers are designed to run\noffline, that is, first generate paths for all agents and then execute them.\nReal-Time MAPF (RT-MAPF) embodies a realistic MAPF setup in which one cannot\nwait until a complete path for each agent has been found before they start to\nmove. Instead, planning and execution are interleaved, where the agents must\ncommit to a fixed number of steps in a constant amount of computation time,\nreferred to as the planning budget. Existing solutions to RT-MAPF iteratively\ncall windowed versions of MAPF algorithms in every planning period, without\nexplicitly considering the size of the planning budget. We address this gap and\nexplore different policies for allocating the planning budget in windowed\nversions of standard MAPF algorithms, namely Prioritized Planning (PrP) and\nMAPF-LNS2.

Its objective\nis to minimize the sum of path costs (SOC), where the path cost of each agent\nis defined as the travel time from its start location to its target location.\nExplicit Estimation Conflict-Based Search (EECBS) is the leading algorithm for\nbounded-suboptimal MAPF, with the SOC of the solution being at most a\nuser-specified factor $w$ away from optimal. EECBS maintains sets of paths and\na lower bound $LB$ on the optimal SOC. Then, it iteratively selects a set of\npaths whose SOC is at most $w \\cdot LB$ and introduces constraints to resolve\ncollisions. For each path in a set, EECBS maintains a lower bound on its\noptimal path that satisfies constraints. By finding an individually\nbounded-suboptimal path with cost at most a threshold of $w$ times its lower\nbound, EECBS guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution. To speed up\nEECBS, previous work uses flex distribution to increase the threshold. Though\nEECBS with flex distribution guarantees to find a bounded-suboptimal solution,\nincreasing the thresholds may push the SOC beyond $w \\cdot LB$, forcing EECBS\nto switch among different sets of paths instead of resolving collisions on a\nparticular set of paths, and thus reducing efficiency.

We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional\nalignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across\ndilemmas.

TDR\ncomprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of\ndriving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances\ndexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces\nintensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control\nrequires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a\nreconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable\njoints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through\na pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a\ncontinuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively\nactuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates\nthe inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex\ncoordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated\nand compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further\nrevealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and\nvalidation experiments have been conducted.

Although semantics has been\nwidely researched in AI, how high-level semantics can benefit the HRT paradigm\nis underexplored, often fuzzy, and intractable. We applied a semantics-based\nframework that could reveal different indicators of the environment (i.e. how\nmuch semantic information exists) in a mock-up disaster response mission. In\nsuch missions, semantics are crucial as the HRT should handle complex\nsituations and respond quickly with correct decisions, where humans might have\na high workload and stress. Especially when human operators need to shift their\nattention between robots and other tasks, they will struggle to build\nSituational Awareness (SA) quickly. The experiment suggests that the presented\nsemantics: 1) alleviate the perceived workload of human operators; 2) increase\nthe operator's trust in the SA; and 3) help to reduce the reaction time in\nswitching the level of autonomy when needed. Additionally, we find that\nparticipants with higher trust in the system are encouraged by high-level\nsemantics to use teleoperation mode more."}

Traditional retrieval-based methods for\ngeo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while\nclassification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive\ntraining data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a\npromising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.\nHowever, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to\nhallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone\nsolutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework\nthat combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place\nrecognition (VPR) methods.

The second stage is modeled as a joint\nprediction process, which takes the scene context and the marginal proposals\nfrom the first stage as inputs to learn the final joint distribution. We\nexplicitly introduce key waypoints to guide the joint prediction module in\nbetter capturing and leveraging the critical information from the initial\npredicted trajectories. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world\nWaymo Open Motion Dataset interactive prediction benchmark. The results show\nthat our approach achieves competitive performance. In particular, in the\nframework comparison experiments, the proposed JAM outperforms other prediction\nframeworks and achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive trajectory\nprediction.

One appealing and widely used method is the classifier\ntwo-sample test (C2ST), where a classifier is trained to distinguish samples\nfrom the true posterior $p(\\theta \\mid y)$ versus the learned NPE approximation\n$q(\\theta \\mid y)$. Yet despite the appealing simplicity of the C2ST, its\ntheoretical and practical reliability depend upon having access to a\nnear-Bayes-optimal classifier -- a requirement that is rarely met and, at best,\ndifficult to verify. Thus a major open question is: can a weak classifier still\nbe useful for neural posterior validation? We show that the answer is yes.\nBuilding on the work of Hu and Lei, we present several key results for a\nconformal variant of the C2ST, which converts any trained classifier's scores\n-- even those of weak or over-fitted models -- into exact finite-sample\np-values. We establish two key theoretical properties of the conformal C2ST:\n(i) finite-sample Type-I error control, and (ii) non-trivial power that\ndegrades gently in tandem with the error of the trained classifier.

To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated\nLearning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw\ndata. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to\nthe heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),\ncomputational node capabilities, and environmental impact.\n  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a\ndata-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on\nreducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.\nOur methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated\ndatasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,\nand the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We\ndevelop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric\nfactors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon\nemissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive\nrecommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,\nminimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to\ntime series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the\nenvironmental impact of FL tasks."}

Importantly, we show that as the number of resources\ngrows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected\noutput conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,\nwhen only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall\nexpected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated\npredictor.

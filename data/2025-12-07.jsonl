However, achieving high performance is challenging due to emotional complexity and scarce annotated data. To tackle these challenges, we propose a multi-loss learning (MLL) framework integrating an energy-adaptive mixup (EAM) method and a frame-level attention module (FLAM). The EAM method leverages SNR-based augmentation to generate diverse speech samples capturing subtle emotional variations. FLAM enhances frame-level feature extraction for multi-frame emotional cues. Our MLL strategy combines Kullback-Leibler divergence, focal, center, and supervised contrastive loss to optimize learning, address class imbalance, and improve feature separability. We evaluate our method on four widely used SER datasets: IEMOCAP, MSP-IMPROV, RAVDESS, and SAVEE. The results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, suggesting its effectiveness and robustness."}

The policy model can exploit a vanilla Reward Model (RM) by generating acoustic artifacts to achieve spurious rewards, but at the cost of degrading perceptual quality. To address this, we propose Robust Reward Policy Optimization (RRPO), a novel framework that employs a hybrid regularization scheme. This scheme develops a robust RM whose reward signal is more reliably aligned with human perception, compelling the policy to abandon detrimental shortcuts and instead learn the complex features of genuine emotions. Our ablation study confirms the enhanced robustness of our RM, as evidenced by its strong cross-lingual generalization. The subjective evaluation demonstrates that this robust RM effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to significant improvements in both emotional expressiveness and naturalness over all baselines.

Three classes of machine learning approaches - unsupervised, supervised, and explainable - were evaluated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to extract the first two principal components, which together explained more than 50 percent of the variance. Seven supervised multi-class classifiers were trained and compared, alongside unsupervised and explainable methods. Model development and evaluation used a large auditory reference database containing ACALOS data (N = 847). The PCA factor map showed substantial overlap between listeners, indicating that cleanly separating participants into six Bisgaard classes based solely on their loudness patterns is challenging. Nevertheless, the models demonstrated reasonable classification performance, with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy among supervised approaches. These findings demonstrate that machine learning models can predict standard Bisgaard audiogram types, within certain limits, from calibration-independent loudness perception data, supporting potential applications in remote or resource-limited settings without requiring a traditional audiogram."}

MindFuse operates across the full marketing lifecycle: from distilling content pillars and customer personas from competitor campaigns to recommending in-flight optimizations based on live performance telemetry. It uses attention-based explainability to diagnose ad effectiveness and guide content iteration, while aligning messaging with strategic goals through dynamic narrative construction and storytelling. We introduce a new paradigm in GenAI for marketing, where LLMs not only generate content but reason through it, adapt campaigns in real time, and learn from audience engagement patterns. Our results, validated in agency deployments, demonstrate up to 12 times efficiency gains, setting the stage for future integration with empirical audience data (e.g., GWI, Nielsen) and full-funnel attribution modeling.

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment."}

Spatial presence, the sense of \"being there\", is becoming less of a primary objective and more of a baseline expectation of virtual reality. More than six decades after its invention, VR is shifting from a technical system into a cultural, social, and phenomenological medium, offering experiences that function as distinct modes of reality. Existing theories that focus primarily on perceptual illusions are no longer sufficient to account for these emerging forms of experience. A new framework is needed to guide the design and evaluation of immersive environments by identifying the key technical and abstract dimensions afforded by virtual worlds. These dimensions include spatial, placeness, temporal, social, cultural, cognitive, and psychological parameters. The central argument is that immersive environments must move beyond the technical dimension to leverage richer information channels that shape user experience. This shift from presence to experience orchestration invites creators across disciplines to contribute to the design and assessment of meaningful immersive worlds."}

Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions."}

This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems."}

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), exemplified by the recent Search-R1, offers fast convergence and a value-free formulation that makes it appealing for this setting, yet consistently suffers from training collapse. We identify Lazy Likelihood Displacement (LLD), a systematic reduction or stagnation in the likelihood of both correct and incorrect responses, as the core mechanism driving this failure. LLD emerges early and triggers a self-reinforcing LLD Death Spiral, where declining likelihood leads to low-confidence responses, inflating gradients, and ultimately causing collapse. We empirically characterize this process across models on a Search-R1-style, search-integrated question answering task, revealing a consistent three-phase trajectory: early stagnation, steady decay, and accelerated collapse. To address this, we propose a lightweight likelihood-preserving regularization LLDS for GRPO that activates only when a trajectory's likelihood decreases, and regularizes only the tokens responsible. This fine-grained structure mitigates LLD with minimal interference to optimization. Across seven open-domain and multi-hop QA benchmarks, our method stabilizes training, prevents gradient explosion, and yields substantial performance improvements, including +37.8% gains on Qwen2.5-3B and +32.0% gains on Qwen2.5-7B. Our results establish LLD as a fundamental bottleneck in GRPO-based TIRL and provide a practical path toward stable, scalable training of tool-integrated LLM."}

While complete methods like backtracking guarantee a solution, their exponential time complexity makes them impractical for large-scale instances thus, stochastic approaches, such as Las Vegas algorithm, are preferred. While it offers faster approximate solutions, it suffers from significant performance variance due to random placement of queens on the board. This research introduces a hybrid algorithm built on top of the standard Las Vegas framework through iterative pruning, dynamically eliminating invalid placements during the random assignment phase, thus this method effectively reduces the search space. The analysis results that traditional backtracking scales poorly with increasing N. In contrast, the proposed technique consistently generates valid solutions more rapidly, establishing it as a superior alternative to use where a single, timely solution is preferred over completeness. Although large N causes some performance variability, the algorithm demonstrates a highly effective trade-off between computational cost and solution fidelity, making it particularly suited for resource-constrained computing environments."}

Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing. A network trained on our data learns to spot these sophisticated biomechanical flaws, achieving state-of-the-art generalization results on several popular benchmarks."}

We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation. The framework is validated using the same elder-caregiver ABM dataset introduced in the companion paper, and we provide precise definitions and propositions formalizing the mathematical complementarity between $ε$-machines and diffusion models.

The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task.

To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows.

The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings.

To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

Experiments show that our model achieves superior performance over existing approaches in both objective measures and subjective listening tests, especially in zero-shot and lyric adaptation settings, while maintaining high audio quality without manual annotation. This work offers a practical and scalable solution for advancing data-efficient singing voice synthesis. To support reproducibility, we release our inference code and model checkpoints."}

This paper puts forward a groundbreaking new framework that is the first to capture the real-world economic forces that shape agentic labor markets: adverse selection, moral hazard, and reputation dynamics. Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy."}

In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives."}

A lightweight agent supervises retrieval, refinement, or combination of results across both paths when confidence is low. This design maintains header hierarchies, time labels, and units, ensuring that returned values are faithful to the original cells and straightforward to verify.

Clinical guidelines highlight several 'red flag' features, such as thunderclap onset, meningismus, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, signs of temporal arteritis, systemic illness, and the 'worst headache of their life' presentation. Despite these guidelines, determining which patients require urgent evaluation remains challenging in primary care settings. Clinicians often work with limited time, incomplete information, and diverse symptom presentations, which can lead to under-recognition and inappropriate care. We present a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent clinical decision support system built on an orchestrator-specialist architecture, designed to perform explicit and interpretable secondary headache diagnosis from free-text clinical vignettes. The multi-agent system decomposes diagnosis into seven domain-specialized agents, each producing a structured and evidence-grounded rationale, while a central orchestrator performs task decomposition and coordinates agent routing. We evaluated the multi-agent system using 90 expert-validated secondary headache cases and compared its performance with a single-LLM baseline across two prompting strategies: question-based prompting (QPrompt) and clinical practice guideline-based prompting (GPrompt). We tested five open-source LLMs (Qwen-30B, GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen-14B, Qwen-8B, and Llama-3.1-8B), and found that the orchestrated multi-agent system with GPrompt consistently achieved the highest F1 scores, with larger gains in smaller models. These findings demonstrate that structured multi-agent reasoning improves accuracy beyond prompt engineering alone and offers a transparent, clinically aligned approach for explainable decision support in secondary headache diagnosis."}

LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback. Event boundaries emerge naturally as transient peaks in prediction error, yielding temporally coherent, nested partonomies that mirror the containment relations observed in human event perception. Evaluated across three benchmarks, Breakfast Actions, 50 Salads, and Assembly 101, PARSE achieves state-of-the-art performance among streaming methods and rivals offline baselines in both temporal alignment (H-GEBD) and structural consistency (TED, hF1).

Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge.

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain. Overall, the method offers a robust, low-resource landing strategy that enhances the feasibility of autonomous planetary missions with small spacecraft."}

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively.

We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C. We instantiate the framework on URGENT2024 MOS (6.9k speech utterances with raw rating vectors) and SingMOS v1 (7,981 singing clips; 80 systems). On URGENT, we train a contract-aware neural auditor on self-supervised WavLM embeddings; on SingMOS, we perform contract-driven graph auditing using released rating vectors and metadata without decoding audio. Empirically, our auditor matches strong MOS predictors in MOS accuracy while providing calibrated contract probabilities; on SingMOS, Q(G, C) exhibits substantially smaller cross-view drift than raw MOS and graph-only baselines; on URGENT, difficulty curves reveal that mis-specified \"simple\" contracts can be harder to learn than richer but better aligned contract sets."}

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks. Finally, we discuss the implications of these vulnerabilities and propose multi-scale consistency checks as a necessary defense mechanism."}

Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions. We evaluate FALCON on two challenging loco-manipulation tasks requiring navigation, precise end-effector placement, and tight base-arm coordination.

Unlike existing SAT-solving platforms that require CNF as input, LangSAT enables users to input standard English descriptions, making SAT-solving more accessible. The framework comprises two key components: Lang2Logic, which translates English sentences into CNF expressions, and SmartSAT, an RL-based SAT solver. SmartSAT encodes clause-variable relationships as structured graph representations and extracts global features specific to the SAT problem. This implementation provides the RL agent with deeper contextual information, enabling SAT problems to be solved more efficiently. Lang2Logic was evaluated on diverse natural language inputs, processing descriptions up to 450 words. The generated CNFs were solved by SmartSAT, which demonstrated comparable performance to traditional CDCL heuristics with respect to solving time. The combined LangSAT framework offers a more accessible and scalable solution for SAT-solving tasks across reasoning, formal verification, and debugging."}

While effective for generative fluency, this one-directional approach leaves models vulnerable to logical fallacies, adversarial manipulation, and failures in causal reasoning. This paper makes two contributions. First, it demonstrates how existing LLMs from major platforms exhibit systematic weaknesses when reasoning in scientific domains with negation, counterexamples, or faulty premises \\footnote{Code to recreate these experiments are at https://github.com/hannahdavidsoncollege-maker/ScientificReasoningForEnvironment-MedicineWithLLMs. Second, it introduces a dual-reasoning training framework that integrates affirmative generation with structured counterfactual denial.

By coupling generative synthesis with explicit negation-aware objectives, the framework enables models that not only affirm valid inferences but also reject invalid ones, yielding systems that are more resilient, interpretable, and aligned with human reasoning."}

ReasonX is model-agnostic and can be applied to different intrinsic predictors. Across multiple base architectures and modalities, ReasonX yields significant improvements, including 9-25% WHDR reduction on IIW albedo and up to 46% depth accuracy gains on ETH3D, highlighting the promise of MLLM-guided comparative supervision to bridge low- and high-level vision reasoning."}

At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

We highlight two recurring limitations in much of the current literature: (i) rule based (deontological) methods that encode duties as constraints or shields often struggle under ambiguity and nonstationarity and do not cultivate lasting habits, and (ii) many reward based approaches, especially single objective RL, implicitly compress diverse moral considerations into a single scalar signal, which can obscure trade offs and invite proxy gaming in practice. We instead treat ethics as policy level dispositions, that is, relatively stable habits that hold up when incentives, partners, or contexts change. This shifts evaluation beyond rule checks or scalar returns toward trait summaries, durability under interventions, and explicit reporting of moral trade offs. Our roadmap combines four components: (1) social learning in multi agent RL to acquire virtue like patterns from imperfect but normatively informed exemplars; (2) multi objective and constrained formulations that preserve value conflicts and incorporate risk aware criteria to guard against harm; (3) affinity based regularization toward updateable virtue priors that support trait like stability under distribution shift while allowing norms to evolve; and (4) operationalizing diverse ethical traditions as practical control signals, making explicit the value and cultural assumptions that shape ethical RL benchmarks."}

First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences.

Modality-specific encoders for text, images, irradiance, and environment maps are trained contrastively to align their representations, with an auxiliary spherical-harmonics prediction task reinforcing directional understanding.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications."}

Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation. These findings highlight the current limitations of VLA models in handling the dexterity and precision required for robotic EoL product disassembly.

To address these challenges, we propose MSME, a Multi-Stage, Multi-Expert framework for zero-shot stance detection. MSME consists of three stages: (1) Knowledge Preparation, where relevant background knowledge is retrieved and stance labels are clarified; (2) Expert Reasoning, involving three specialized modules-Knowledge Expert distills salient facts and reasons from a knowledge perspective, Label Expert refines stance labels and reasons accordingly, and Pragmatic Expert detects rhetorical cues such as irony to infer intent from a pragmatic angle; (3) Decision Aggregation, where a Meta-Judge integrates all expert analyses to produce the final stance prediction.

In traditional RL settings, agents learn optimal policies through interactions with an environment guided by reward signals. However, when these signals are sparse, delayed, or poorly aligned with the intended task objectives, agents often struggle to learn effectively. Dense reward functions, which provide informative feedback at every step or state transition, offer a potential solution by shaping agent behavior and accelerating learning. Despite their benefits, poorly crafted reward functions can lead to unintended behaviors, reward hacking, or inefficient exploration. This problem is particularly acute in complex or high-dimensional environments where handcrafted rewards are difficult to specify and validate. To address this, recent research has explored a variety of approaches, including inverse reinforcement learning, reward modeling from human preferences, and self-supervised learning of intrinsic rewards. While these methods offer promising directions, they often involve trade-offs between generality, scalability, and alignment with human intent. This proposal explores several approaches to dealing with these unsolved problems and enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of dense reward construction in different RL applications."}

To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task."}

BALI combines language and action cues from the human, asks clarifying questions only when the expected information gain from the answer outweighs the cost of interruption, and selects supportive actions that align with inferred goals.

In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture."}

First, they depend on structured triplets that are misaligned with the free-text nature of LLM pretraining and fail to capture the nuanced relationships among facts. Second, they typically support one-time knowledge updates, with relatively limited research on the problem of sequential or lifelong editing. To address these gaps, we propose a new task, Lifelong Free-text Knowledge Editing (LF-Edit), which enables models to incorporate updates expressed in natural language and supports continual editing over time. Despite its promise, LF-Edit faces the dual challenge of integrating new knowledge while mitigating the forgetting of prior information. To foster research on this new task, we construct a large-scale benchmark, Multi-Rank Lifelong Free-text Editing Benchmark (MRLF-Bench), containing 16,835 free-text edit requests. We further design a cognitively inspired multi-rank evaluation framework encompassing four levels: memorization, understanding, constrained comprehension, and reasoning. To tackle the challenges inherent in LF-Edit, we introduce a novel approach named EvoEdit that enhances knowledge injection through Latent Perturbation Augmentation and preserves prior information via Knowledge-driven Parameter Fusion.

From the data perspective, we introduce semantic entropy-guided curriculum learning, organizing training data from low to high semantic entropy to guide progressive optimization from easier to more challenging tasks. For the algorithmic design, we adopt non-uniform token treatment by imposing KL regularization on low-entropy tokens that critically impact policy exploration and applying stronger constraints on high-covariance portions within these tokens.

Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment.

Its core contribution is a unified session accessible via a hybrid control interface: An AI agent can interact programmatically via mainstream interfaces (MCP, Open Source SDK), while a human operator can, at any moment, seamlessly take over full manual control. This seamless intervention is enabled by Adaptive Streaming Protocol (ASP). Unlike traditional VNC/RDP, ASP is specifically engineered for this hybrid use case, delivering an ultra-low-latency, smoother user experience that remains resilient even in weak network environments. It achieves this by dynamically blending command-based and video-based streaming, adapting its encoding strategy based on network conditions and the current controller (AI or human). Our evaluation demonstrates strong results in security, performance, and task completion rates. In a benchmark of complex tasks, the AgentBay (Agent + Human) model achieved more than 48% success rate improvement. Furthermore, our ASP protocol reduces bandwidth consumption by up to 50% compared to standard RDP, and in end-to-end latency with around 5% reduction, especially under poor network conditions. We posit that AgentBay provides a foundational primitive for building the next generation of reliable, human-supervised autonomous systems."}

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD."}

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios. Together, these results identify conditions for spectral gradient methods, such as Muon, to be effective in training deep networks and transformers."}

This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

This manual step is slow, error-prone, difficult to scale, and often delays the use of safeguards in real-world deployments. To address this gap, we present Policy-to-Tests (P2T), a framework that converts natural-language policy documents into normalized, machine-readable rules. The framework comprises a pipeline and a compact domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes hazards, scope, conditions, exceptions, and required evidence, yielding a canonical representation of extracted rules. To test the framework beyond a single policy, we apply it across general frameworks, sector guidance, and enterprise standards, extracting obligation-bearing clauses and converting them into executable rules. These AI-generated rules closely match strong human baselines on span-level and rule-level metrics, with robust inter-annotator agreement on the gold set. To evaluate downstream behavioral and safety impact, we add HIPAA-derived safeguards to a generative agent and compare it with an otherwise identical agent without guardrails. An LLM-based judge, aligned with gold-standard criteria, measures violation rates and robustness to obfuscated and compositional prompts. Detailed results are provided in the appendix. We release the codebase, DSL, prompts, and rule sets as open-source resources to enable reproducible evaluation."}

In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness.

This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts."}

The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields.

To address this, we propose LexGenius, an expert-level Chinese legal benchmark for evaluating legal GI in LLMs. It follows a Dimension-Task-Ability framework, covering seven dimensions, eleven tasks, and twenty abilities. We use the recent legal cases and exam questions to create multiple-choice questions with a combination of manual and LLM reviews to reduce data leakage risks, ensuring accuracy and reliability through multiple rounds of checks. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs using LexGenius and conduct an in-depth analysis. We find significant disparities across legal intelligence abilities for LLMs, with even the best LLMs lagging behind human legal professionals.

To bridge this gap, we introduce GovBench, a benchmark featuring 150 diverse tasks grounded in real-world scenarios, built on data from actual cases. GovBench employs a novel \"reversed-objective\" methodology to synthesize realistic noise and utilizes rigorous metrics to assess end-to-end pipeline reliability. Our analysis on GovBench reveals that current models struggle with complex, multi-step workflows and lack robust error-correction mechanisms. Consequently, we propose DataGovAgent, a framework utilizing a Planner-Executor-Evaluator architecture that integrates constraint-based planning, retrieval-augmented generation, and sandboxed feedback-driven debugging. Experimental results show that DataGovAgent significantly boosts the Average Task Score (ATS) on complex tasks from 39.7 to 54.9 and reduces debugging iterations by over 77.9 percent compared to general-purpose baselines."}

The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap. We specifically tested the combined use of retrieved examples of captions, and latent vector representations, to guide the generation process. Through extensive experiments, we show that TOMCap outperforms other training-free and text-only methods.

Yet, the link between computation-through-dynamics and representational geometry remains poorly understood. Here, we hypothesise that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) perform computations by dynamically warping their representations of task variables. To test this hypothesis, we develop a Riemannian geometric framework that enables the derivation of the manifold topology and geometry of a dynamical system from the manifold of its inputs. By characterising the time-varying geometry of RNNs, we show that dynamic warping is a fundamental feature of their computations."}

If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x.

While psycholinguistic studies suggest that GM is more readily associated with male referents, corpus-based analyses of its actual use remain scarce. We investigate GM in a large corpus of press texts, focusing on lexeme-specific differences across dif-ferent types of personal nouns. We conducted manual annotations of the whole inflectional para-digm of 21 personal nouns, resulting in 6,195 annotated tokens. Our findings reveal considerable differences between lexical items, especially between passive role nouns and prestige-related per-sonal nouns. On a grammatical level, we find that GM occurs predominantly in the plural and in indefinite noun phrases. Furthermore, our data shows that GM is not primarily used to denote entire classes of people, as has been previously claimed. By providing an empirical insight into the use of GM in authentic written language, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of its forms and manifestations.

We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training."}

In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation.

Understanding where and how these subtle failures occur in an application relies on evaluation methods known as \\textit{evals}. Prior work focuses on defining new eval methods or benchmark datasets for specific tasks. However, neither helps a software team with a task-specific FM application when there is no metric or dataset. The demand for both automated approaches and deep integration of human insight makes this a challenging problem. We address this gap by proposing an approach to synthesise a FM task-specific evaluator program that provides automation and a custom UI for capturing feedback. The core novelty of our approach lies in: (1) a task-agnostic meta-model that captures properties of any FM task, (2) an interaction protocol for efficient use of human feedback, and (3) an eval synthesiser that selects or generates an appropriate set of evals. We implement our approach in \\toolname and demonstrate the concept on two diverse FM tasks: chart data extraction and document question answering. A preliminary evaluation on the quality of our selected evals shows 93\\% and 90\\% accuracy respectively. Our research tackles a growing problem facing engineering teams, how to evaluate and review outputs from FM tasks."}

Our model uses a CNN-Transformer encoder to map EEG signals into dense 3D position maps, capable of sampling over 65k vertices, capturing fine-scale geometry and subtle emotional dynamics, and renders them through a modified 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline for photorealistic, view-consistent results. Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed.

The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation.

This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance."}

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets. Notably, it succeeds with planning horizons of several hundred steps, challenging common belief. Finally, we characterize when Neubay is preferable to conservatism, laying the foundation for a new direction in offline and model-based RL."}

Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories."}

Existing test-time adaptation methods often require tuning model parameters, which is not only computationally expensive but also risks degrading the model's pre-existing abilities.To address this, we introduce a lightweight component, Test-Time Steering Vectors (TTSV), which is prepended to the input while keeping the LLM's parameters entirely frozen. By optimizing the TTSV on test data to minimize the model's output entropy, we steer the model towards an internal state of higher confidence, activating its inherent abilities most relevant to the current task. TTSV is both lightweight and highly efficient to optimize, making it a true plug-and-play enhancement. Extensive experiments validate our approach's effectiveness on both base models and reasoning-enhanced models. For instance, on the MATH500 task, TTSV achieves a 45.88% relative performance gain on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model and a 16.22% relative gain on the Qwen3-4B model.

Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach.

The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset.

Prior efforts sought to tune the knowledge layers of LLMs, proving effective for making selective edits. However, a significant gap exists between their performance in controlled, teacher-forcing evaluations and their real-world effectiveness in lifelong learning scenarios, which greatly limits their practical applicability. This work's empirical analysis reveals two recurring issues associated with this gap: (1) Most traditional methods lead the edited model to overfit to the new fact, thereby degrading pre-trained capabilities; (2) There is a critical absence of a knowledge consolidation stage, leaving new facts insufficiently integrated into LLMs' inference-time behavior under autoregressive generation, thereby leading to a mismatch between parametric knowledge and actual generation behavior. To this end, we propose Edit-then-Consolidate, a novel knowledge editing paradigm that aims to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge editing methods and their real-world applicability. Specifically, (1) our framework mitigates overfitting via Targeted Proximal Supervised Fine-Tuning (TPSFT) that localizes the edit via a trust-region objective to limit policy drift; (2) Then, a consolidation stage using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) aligns the edited knowledge with CoT-based inference policy by optimizing trajectory-level behavior under comprehensive reward signals.

We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the \"FAGNER Paradox\" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the \"Lukaku Paradox\", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions."}

Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs.

Yet, systematic evaluation of these models, especially for languages beyond English, remains limited. \"Challenging the Abilities of LAnguage Models in ITAlian\" (CALAMITA) is a large-scale collaborative benchmarking initiative for Italian, coordinated under the Italian Association for Computational Linguistics. Unlike existing efforts that focus on leaderboards, CALAMITA foregrounds methodology: it federates more than 80 contributors from academia, industry, and the public sector to design, document, and evaluate a diverse collection of tasks, covering linguistic competence, commonsense reasoning, factual consistency, fairness, summarization, translation, and code generation. Through this process, we not only assembled a benchmark of over 20 tasks and almost 100 subtasks, but also established a centralized evaluation pipeline that supports heterogeneous datasets and metrics. We report results for four open-weight LLMs, highlighting systematic strengths and weaknesses across abilities, as well as challenges in task-specific evaluation. Beyond quantitative results, CALAMITA exposes methodological lessons: the necessity of fine-grained, task-representative metrics, the importance of harmonized pipelines, and the benefits and limitations of broad community engagement. CALAMITA is conceived as a rolling benchmark, enabling continuous integration of new tasks and models. This makes it both a resource -- the most comprehensive and diverse benchmark for Italian to date -- and a framework for sustainable, community-driven evaluation. We argue that this combination offers a blueprint for other languages and communities seeking inclusive and rigorous LLM evaluation practices."}

Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code. Overall, NN-RAG transforms fragmented vision code into a reproducible, provenance-tracked substrate for algorithmic discovery, offering a first open-source solution that both quantifies and expands the diversity of executable neural architectures across repositories."}

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields."}

However, they fall short of replicating the natural movement and interaction capabilities of the human arm. In contrast, human limbs leverage intrinsic compliance and actively modulate joint stiffness, enabling adaptive responses to varying tasks, impact absorption, and efficient energy transfer during dynamic actions. Inspired by this adaptability, we developed a transhumeral prosthesis with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) to replicate the controllable compliance found in biological joints. The proposed prosthesis features a modular design, allowing customization for different residual limb shapes and accommodating a range of independent control signals derived from users' biological cues. Integrated elastic elements passively support more natural movements, facilitate safe interactions with the environment, and adapt to diverse task requirements.

Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories. Moreover, on the traditional Real-versus-Fake face forgery detection task, our DLED method concurrently exhibits competitive performance."}

In this work, we introduce a new kind of Conductor model trained with reinforcement learning to automatically discover powerful coordination strategies among LLMs. Our Conductor learns not only to design targeted communication topologies for effective agent-to-agent collaboration, but also to prompt engineer focused instructions to the LLMs to maximally leverage their individual capabilities. We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation. More broadly, ours is among the early work demonstrating language model coordination can be unlocked through RL, where powerful coordination strategies emerge naturally in LLMs through pure end-to-end reward maximization."}

A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments. This work establishes a hierarchical simulation pipeline that advances robust, terrain-aware locomotion for robots operating in challenging unstructured settings."}

The results are then used as a benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models on a linguistic acceptability judgement task. Our findings demonstrate that this extension is both broader and more comprehensive than the current state of the art. By incorporating a greater variety of corruption types, our benchmark provides a more rigorous assessment of linguistic acceptability, increasing task difficulty, as evidenced by the lower performance of LLMs on our benchmark compared to existing ones.

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer strong semantic priors and cross-modal generalization, while world models (WMs) provide actionable latent dynamics for prediction and control. Their combination holds promise for open-ended embodied intelligence, yet introduces two key challenges: (1) establishing a tight coupling between the semantic intent from MLLMs and the dynamic state representations within the WM's latent space, and (2) achieving task-aware adaptability that supports multi-task learning and cross-environment generalization. To address these limitations, we propose BiTAgent, a task-aware dynamic joint framework that enables bidirectional coupling between MLLMs and WMs. BiTAgent establishes two complementary pathways: a forward path that injects MLLM representations into the WM's latent space for semantically guided imagination, and a backward path where WM-generated feedback refines the MLLM's semantic space via dense text-conditioned rewards. This bidirectional interaction is realized through three synergistic components: Task-Aware Dynamic Joint Learning, Task-Aware Behavior Learning, and MLLM-WM Joint Optimization, which together harmonize semantic reasoning and dynamic prediction. Extensive experiments across multi-task and cross-environment settings demonstrate superior stability and generalization over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a step toward open-ended embodied learning."}

However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SANTA outperforms existing methods in alleviating object and action hallucinations, yielding superior performance on the hallucination examination benchmarks."}

Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups.

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning. This work offers a promising path to realizing the potential of video generation models as high-level policies for robot control."}

We introduce a novel framework, called Info-Mask for mixed authorship detection that integrates stylometric cues, perplexity-driven signals, and structured boundary modeling to accurately segment collaborative human-AI content. To evaluate the robustness of our system against adversarial perturbations, we construct and release an adversarial benchmark dataset Mixed-text Adversarial setting for Segmentation (MAS), designed to probe the limits of existing detectors. Beyond segmentation accuracy, we introduce Human-Interpretable Attribution (HIA overlays that highlight how stylometric features inform boundary predictions, and we conduct a small-scale human study assessing their usefulness. Across multiple architectures, Info-Mask significantly improves span-level robustness under adversarial conditions, establishing new baselines while revealing remaining challenges.

To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAFNet significantly outperforms existing real-time methods on public datasets such as Scene Flow and KITTI 2015, showing a favorable balance between accuracy and real-time performance."}

Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models. Experiments on SimplerEnv and ManiSkill3 demonstrate substantial gains, achieving state-of-the-art success rates of 98.0 percent on SimplerEnv and 96.4 percent on ManiSkill3 tasks."}

We tackle this challenge under a realistic, low-resource constraint: adapting instruct LLMs using only unlabeled target language data. We introduce Source-Shielded Updates (SSU), a selective parameter update strategy that proactively preserves source knowledge. Using a small set of source data and a parameter importance scoring method, SSU identifies parameters critical to maintaining source abilities. It then applies a column-wise freezing strategy to protect these parameters before adaptation. Experiments across five typologically diverse languages and 7B and 13B models demonstrate that SSU successfully mitigates catastrophic forgetting. It reduces performance degradation on monolingual source tasks to just 3.4% (7B) and 2.8% (13B) on average, a stark contrast to the 20.3% and 22.3% from full fine-tuning.

With only prompt-level configuration, GTM accesses tool functionalities along with input arguments and generates outputs that faithfully mimic real tool execution, providing a fast and cost-effective solution that eliminates development overhead. To build GTM, we propose the Context-Aware Response Generation (CARG) pipeline, which synthesizes comprehensive training data covering over 20,000 tools across 300 domains including physics, medicine, robotics, and finance. Through this pipeline, GTM learns to produce not only syntactically correct outputs but also logically coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Experiments demonstrate that GTM produces high-quality outputs with strong consistency and reliability. Besides when used in real reinforcement learning scenarios for agent training, GTM exhibits significantly faster simulation speed compared to real tools while maintaining comparable output quality, along with remarkable generalization and domain adaptability.

We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement. The evaluation on the GPU-NDP system shows that our approach achieves up to an 8.7-fold decoding throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art method, while incurring only a 0.13% average accuracy drop."}

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning."}

In this paper, we propose Fourier-Attentive Representation Learning (FARL), a novel framework that addresses this by explicitly disentangling visual representations using Fourier analysis. The core of our method is a dual cross-attention mechanism, where learnable representation tokens separately query an image's structural features (from the phase spectrum) and stylistic features (from the amplitude spectrum). This process yields enriched, disentangled tokens that are then injected deep into the VLM encoders to guide adaptation. Our design, which includes an asymmetric injection strategy, forces the model to learn a more robust vision-language alignment.

However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets."}

A current challenge is to reconstruct speech in a streaming mode by directly regressing cortical signals into acoustic speech.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements."}

Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization. In our experiments, we show how to learn and explain graph representations for real-world data using pattern analysis.

From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%.

Our method realizes this scaling by addressing three orthogonal dimensions: (1) Complexity: NexAU, a flexible agent framework that supports building complex agent hierarchies via simple configurations; (2) Diversity: NexA4A automatically generates diverse agent hierarchies from natural language to cover infinite domains; and (3) Fidelity: NexGAP bridges the simulation-reality gap by integrating dynamic real-world environment for grounded trajectories synthesis.

To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

Built upon a Gemini foundation model, SIMA 2 represents a significant step toward active, goal-directed interaction within an embodied environment. Unlike prior work (e.g., SIMA 1) limited to simple language commands, SIMA 2 acts as an interactive partner, capable of reasoning about high-level goals, conversing with the user, and handling complex instructions given through language and images. Across a diverse portfolio of games, SIMA 2 substantially closes the gap with human performance and demonstrates robust generalization to previously unseen environments, all while retaining the base model's core reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we demonstrate a capacity for open-ended self-improvement: by leveraging Gemini to generate tasks and provide rewards, SIMA 2 can autonomously learn new skills from scratch in a new environment.

We introduce a preconditioning procedure that accelerates Newton-Schulz convergence and reduces its computational cost. We evaluate its impact and show that the overhead of our preconditioning can be made negligible. Furthermore, the faster convergence it enables allows us to remove one iteration out of the usual five without degrading approximation quality. Our publicly available implementation achieves up to a 2.8x speedup in the Newton-Schulz approximation. We also show that this has a direct impact on end-to-end training runtime with 5-10% improvement in realistic training scenarios across two efficiency-focused tasks.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy."}

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry.

Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a \"selection-then-ranking\" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee."}

We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion φ-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. φ-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos.

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization."}

Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization. Our theoretical insights on temporal stability and generalization error further establish Temp-SCONE as a step toward reliable OWL in evolving dynamic environments."}

In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of AI-generated images in supporting self-expression of mental distress. To achieve this, twenty Chinese international students studying at UK universities were invited to describe their personal experiences of mental distress. These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores. Findings indicate that prompt design substantially affects perceived helpfulness, with the illustrator persona achieving the highest ratings. This work introduces the first publicly available text-to-image evaluation dataset with human judgment scores in the mental health domain, offering valuable resources for image evaluation, reinforcement learning with human feedback, and multi-modal research on mental health communication."}

In a nutshell, XIL algorithms select a number of items on which an AI model made a decision (e.g. images and their tags) and present them to users, together with corresponding explanations (e.g. image regions that drive the model's decision). Then, users supply corrective feedback for the explanations, which the algorithm uses to improve the model. Despite showing promise in debugging tasks, recent studies have raised concerns that explanatory interaction may trigger order effects, a well-known cognitive bias in which the sequence of presented items influences users' trust and, critically, the quality of their feedback. We argue that these studies are not entirely conclusive, as the experimental designs and tasks employed differ substantially from common XIL use cases, complicating interpretation. To clarify the interplay between order effects and explanatory interaction, we ran two larger-scale user studies (n = 713 total) designed to mimic common XIL tasks. Specifically, we assessed order effects both within and between debugging sessions by manipulating the order in which correct and wrong explanations are presented to participants. Order effects had a limited, through significant impact on users' agreement with the model (i.e., a behavioral measure of their trust), and only when examined withing debugging sessions, not between them. The quality of users' feedback was generally satisfactory, with order effects exerting only a small and inconsistent influence in both experiments. Overall, our findings suggest that order effects do not pose a significant issue for the successful employment of XIL approaches. More broadly, our work contributes to the ongoing efforts for understanding human factors in AI."}

In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context. Built upon 156 independent long videos, StreamEQA defines 42 tasks and generates approximately 21K question-answer pairs with precise timestamps through a hybrid pipeline combining automated generation and human refinement. Evaluations of 13 state-of-the-art video-LLMs reveal that, despite strong performance on conventional benchmarks, these models still struggle with streaming video understanding in embodied scenarios. We hope StreamEQA will catalyze research on streaming video understanding for embodied applications."}

In this work, we examine retrieval-augmented prompting as a strategy to improve few-shot performance in code vulnerability detection, where the goal is to identify one or more security-relevant weaknesses present in a given code snippet from a predefined set of vulnerability categories. We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning.

However, these systems introduce novel and evolving security challenges, including prompt injection attacks, context poisoning, model manipulation, and opaque agent-to-agent communication, that are not effectively captured by traditional threat modeling frameworks. In this paper, we introduce ASTRIDE, an automated threat modeling platform purpose-built for AI agent-based systems. ASTRIDE extends the classical STRIDE framework by introducing a new threat category, A for AI Agent-Specific Attacks, which encompasses emerging vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, unsafe tool invocation, and reasoning subversion, unique to agent-based applications. To automate threat modeling, ASTRIDE combines a consortium of fine-tuned vision-language models (VLMs) with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM to perform end-to-end analysis directly from visual agent architecture diagrams, such as data flow diagrams(DFDs). LLM agents orchestrate the end-to-end threat modeling automation process by coordinating interactions between the VLM consortium and the reasoning LLM. Our evaluations demonstrate that ASTRIDE provides accurate, scalable, and explainable threat modeling for next-generation intelligent systems. To the best of our knowledge, ASTRIDE is the first framework to both extend STRIDE with AI-specific threats and integrate fine-tuned VLMs with a reasoning LLM to fully automate diagram-driven threat modeling in AI agent-based applications."}

In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations.

While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that consider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency. We open-source mechanisms and annotated datasets for contextual sensitive data detection at https://github.com/trl-lab/sensitive-data-detection."}

A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents."}

The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question."}

In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTS exhibits exceptional generative and cognitive capabilities in both low-level and high-level time series tasks.

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency."}

At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

Even a major breakthrough in dimension $n=8$, later recognised with a Fields Medal, underscores its difficulty. A leading technique for upper bounds, the three-point method, reduces the problem to solving large, high-precision semidefinite programs (SDPs). Because each candidate SDP may take days to evaluate, standard data-intensive AI approaches are infeasible. We address this challenge by formulating SDP construction as a sequential decision process, the SDP game, in which a policy assembles SDP formulations from a set of admissible components. Using a sample-efficient model-based framework that combines Bayesian optimisation with Monte Carlo Tree Search, we obtain new state-of-the-art upper bounds in dimensions $4-16$, showing that model-based search can advance computational progress in longstanding geometric problems. Together, these results demonstrate that sample-efficient, model-based search can make tangible progress on mathematically rigid, evaluation limited problems, pointing towards a complementary direction for AI-assisted discovery beyond large-scale LLM-driven exploration."}

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations."}

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species."}

The method is based on prompting a pre-trained language model decoder with information derived from a CLIP representation, after undergoing a process to reduce the modality gap.

Three major databases and two preprint servers were searched from January 1, 2018 to October 31, 2025, identifying 14 benchmarks that assess AI capabilities in literature understanding, experimental design, and hypothesis generation. The results revealed that all current benchmarks assess isolated component capabilities, including data analysis quality, hypothesis validity, and experimental protocol design.

Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model.

This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives. Furthermore, we develop a tracklet-phrase contrastive alignment to match the regional objects and relation-guided actions with their corresponding visual and temporal phrases.

To assess its prevalence, we construct a benchmark of 200 tasks covering five task types and eight realistic scenarios in a constrained environment, such as broken tools or mismatched information sources. Evaluations of 11 popular LLMs reveal that these agents typically exhibit action-based deceptive behaviors, such as guessing results, performing unsupported simulations, substituting unavailable information sources, and fabricating local files.

Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration. Furthermore, our approach can be trained off-policy without policy gradients, offering a more data-efficient and stable alternative to existing on-policy methods. We present results on a mixture of reasoning, web browsing, and tool-use with dialogue tasks, demonstrating that NLAC shows promise in outperforming existing training approaches and offers a more scalable and stable training paradigm for LLM agents."}

STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench. Theoretical and empirical analyses identify two main factors behind this performance: (1) the coordinator's hidden-state representations provide rich contextualization of inputs, and (2) under high dimensionality and strict budget constraints, the separable Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy offers advantages over reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and random search by exploiting potential block-epsilon-separability."}

As these systems scale, they rely heavily on preprocessing pipelines to handle diverse inputs efficiently. However, this dependency on standard preprocessing operations, specifically image downscaling, creates a significant yet often overlooked security vulnerability. While intended for computational optimization, scaling algorithms can be exploited to conceal malicious visual prompts that are invisible to human observers but become active semantic instructions once processed by the model. Current adversarial strategies remain largely static, failing to account for the dynamic nature of modern agentic workflows. To address this gap, we propose Chameleon, a novel, adaptive adversarial framework designed to expose and exploit scaling vulnerabilities in production VLMs. Unlike traditional static attacks, Chameleon employs an iterative, agent-based optimization mechanism that dynamically refines image perturbations based on the target model's real-time feedback. This allows the framework to craft highly robust adversarial examples that survive standard downscaling operations to hijack downstream execution. We evaluate Chameleon against Gemini 2.5 Flash model. Our experiments demonstrate that Chameleon achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 84.5% across varying scaling factors, significantly outperforming static baseline attacks which average only 32.1%. Furthermore, we show that these attacks effectively compromise agentic pipelines, reducing decision-making accuracy by over 45% in multi-step tasks.

Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."}

However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection. Experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method over both supervised and self-supervised comparison methods. Our code is available in the supplementary material."}

We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls."}

Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works.

Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation.

However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core.

Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism.

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives. We also derive a suboptimality bound for the sequential decomposition under simplifying assumptions. We discuss limitations-including OR homogeneity and the omission of explicit staffing constraints-and outline extensions. Overall, the approach offers a practical, interpretable, and tunable data-driven complement to optimization for real-time OR scheduling."}

STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics.

The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked.

Efficient architectures specifically designed for temporal sequence prediction are still lacking. In this paper, we propose Memory-DD, a low-complexity dendrite-inspired neuron model. Memory-DD consists of two dendrite-inspired neuron groups that contain no nonlinear activation functions but can still realize nonlinear mappings.

This design effectively captures temporal dependencies and is suitable for both classification and regression tasks on sequence data. Experimental results show that Memory-DD achieves an average accuracy of 89.41% on 18 temporal classification benchmark datasets, outperforming LSTM by 4.25%.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, MultiGA, which applies genetic algorithm principles to address complex natural language tasks and reasoning problems by sampling from a diverse population of LLMs to initialize the population. MultiGA generates a range of outputs from various parent LLMs, open source and closed source, and uses a neutral fitness function to evaluate them.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion.

This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input.

Conclusions: Our model outperforms strong baseline models, including CNN and CNN-LSTM architectures on two datasets, achieving the lowest six-component average NRMSE of 5.78% on the insole dataset and 1.42% for the vertical ground reaction force on the public dataset. This demonstrates robust performance for ground reaction force and moment estimation."}

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT."}

The framework combines the natural language understanding capabilities of large language models with multimodal perception, enabling a complete process from user query to concrete action. It operates in three stages: the Ask Module understands user needs through natural language processing; the Browse Module autonomously navigates webpages, interacts with page elements (including forms and calendars), and extracts information from HTML structures and webpage screenshots; the Act Module synthesizes information for users or performs direct actions like form completion and schedule booking. To evaluate its effectiveness, we designed a benchmark test covering 15 real-world tasks, simulating typical legal service processes relevant to Québec civil law users, from problem identification to procedural operations.

However, these solutions mainly \"overlay\" robot arms to egocentric videos, which cannot handle complex full-body motions and scene occlusions in third-person videos, making them unsuitable for robotizing humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million \"robotized\" humanoid video frames.

We perform a systematic evaluation using the Gemini-1.5-Flash model across three approaches: (1) standard few-shot prompting with randomly selected examples, (2) retrieval-augmented prompting using semantically similar examples, and (3) retrieval-based labeling, which assigns labels based on retrieved examples without model inference. Our results show that retrieval-augmented prompting consistently outperforms the other prompting strategies. At 20 shots, it achieves an F1 score of 74.05% and a partial match accuracy of 83.90%. We further compare this approach against zero-shot prompting and several fine-tuned models, including Gemini-1.5-Flash and smaller open-source models such as DistilBERT, DistilGPT2, and CodeBERT. Retrieval-augmented prompting outperforms both zero-shot (F1 score: 36.35%, partial match accuracy: 20.30%) and fine-tuned Gemini (F1 score: 59.31%, partial match accuracy: 53.10%), while avoiding the training time and cost associated with model fine-tuning.

In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence.

To bridge this gap, we introduce HAI-Eval, a unified benchmark designed to measure the synergy of human-AI partnership in coding. HAI-Eval's core innovation is its \"Collaboration-Necessary\" problem templates, which are intractable for both standalone LLMs and unaided humans, but solvable through effective collaboration. Specifically, HAI-Eval uses 45 templates to dynamically create tasks. It also provides a standardized IDE for human participants and a reproducible toolkit with 450 task instances for LLMs, ensuring an ecologically valid evaluation. We conduct a within-subject study with 45 participants and benchmark their performance against 5 state-of-the-art LLMs under 4 different levels of human intervention. Results show that standalone LLMs and unaided participants achieve poor pass rates (0.67% and 18.89%), human-AI collaboration significantly improves performance to 31.11%.

This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation.

The proposed method outperforms the state of the art machine learning models as well as non-fine-tuned large language models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GPT 4o by a considerable margin of over 10-20% in some cases, even after providing the LLMs with reference/model answers. Our framework does not require pre-written grading rubrics and is designed explicitly with practical classroom settings in mind. Our results also reveal exciting insights about learning from near-domain data, including what we term as accuracy and data advantages using human-labeled data, and we believe this is the first work to formalize the problem of automated short answer grading based on the near-domain data."}

It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy. Our approach achieves comparable results to the baselines for two different scenes, and we show qualitative results for an implementation in a real-world scenario."}

This research aimed to examine the relationships between perceived AI competence and risks among Finnish K-12 upper secondary students (n = 163) by utilizing a co-occurrence analysis. Students reported their self-perceived AI competence and concerns related to AI across systemic, institutional, and personal domains. The findings showed that students with lower competence emphasized personal and learning-related risks, such as reduced creativity, lack of critical thinking, and misuse, whereas higher-competence students focused more on systemic and institutional risks, including bias, inaccuracy, and cheating. These differences suggest that students' self-reported AI competence is related to how they evaluate both the risks and opportunities associated with artificial intelligence in education (AIED). The results of this study highlight the need for educational institutions to incorporate AI literacy into their curricula, provide teacher guidance, and inform policy development to ensure personalized opportunities for utilization and equitable integration of AI into K-12 education."}

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the \"missing modality\" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks. Notably, our method maintains robust diagnostic performance even in extreme data-sparsity scenarios, highlighting its potential for reducing radiation exposure while maintaining diagnostic precision."}

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences. Together, these results highlight TV2TV as a promising step toward video generation with open-ended textual reasoning and control."}

Both rest on the classic chain formulated by Good (1965) and Bostrom (2014): intelligence explosion, superintelligence, lethal misalignment. This article subjects each link to the empirical record of 2023-2025. Sixty years after Good's speculation, none of the required phenomena (sustained recursive self-improvement, autonomous strategic awareness, or intractable lethal misalignment) have been observed. Current generative models remain narrow, statistically trained artefacts: powerful, opaque, and imperfect, but devoid of the properties that would make the catastrophic scenarios plausible. Following Whittaker (2025a, 2025b, 2025c) and Zuboff (2019, 2025), we argue that the existential-risk thesis functions primarily as an ideological distraction from the ongoing consolidation of surveillance capitalism and extreme concentration of computational power. The thesis is further inflated by the 2025 AI speculative bubble, where trillions in investments in rapidly depreciating \"digital lettuce\" hardware (McWilliams, 2025) mask lagging revenues and jobless growth rather than heralding superintelligence.

However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network. Extensive experiments on real infrared UAV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art target trackers under complex backgrounds while achieving a real-time tracking speed."}

However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance that matches or exceeds the accuracy of several existing methods for various age cohorts and input configurations using a single model, in a fraction of the runtime required by many existing tools."}

While an abundance of methods for suppressing sensitive data exist, the conceptualization of sensitive data and methods to detect it, focus particularly on personal data that, if disclosed, may be harmful or violate privacy. We observe the need for refining and broadening our definitions of sensitive data, and argue that the sensitivity of data depends on its context. Based on this definition, we introduce two mechanisms for contextual sensitive data detection that consider the broader context of a dataset at hand. First, we introduce type contextualization, which first detects the semantic type of particular data values, then considers the overall context of the data values within the dataset or document. Second, we introduce domain contextualization which determines sensitivity of a given dataset in the broader context based on the retrieval of relevant rules from documents that specify data sensitivity (e.g., data topic and geographic origin). Experiments with these mechanisms, assisted by large language models (LLMs), confirm that: 1) type-contextualization significantly reduces the number of false positives for type-based sensitive data detection and reaches a recall of 94% compared to 63% with commercial tools, and 2) domain-contextualization leveraging sensitivity rule retrieval is effective for context-grounded sensitive data detection in non-standard data domains such as humanitarian datasets. Evaluation with humanitarian data experts also reveals that context-grounded LLM explanations provide useful guidance in manual data auditing processes, improving consistency. We open-source mechanisms and annotated datasets for contextual sensitive data detection at https://github.com/trl-lab/sensitive-data-detection."}

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications. The source code is available here."}

In this work, we leverage the theory of optimal control and propose VGG-Flow, a gradient-matching-based method for finetuning pretrained flow matching models. The key idea behind this algorithm is that the optimal difference between the finetuned velocity field and the pretrained one should be matched with the gradient field of a value function. This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation. Empirically, we show on a popular text-to-image flow matching model, Stable Diffusion 3, that our method can finetune flow matching models under limited computational budgets while achieving effective and prior-preserving alignment."}

It illustrates through empirical evidence as well as critical reflections why the current critical debate is focusing on the wrong problems. The paper proposes that the focus of researching the use of the LLMs for qualitative analysis is not the method per se, but rather the empirical investigation of an artificial system performing an analysis. The paper builds on the seminal work of Alan Turing and reads the current debate using key ideas from Turing \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\". This paper therefore reframes the debate on qualitative analysis with LLMs and states that rather than asking whether machines can perform qualitative analysis in principle, we should ask whether with LLMs we can produce analyses that are sufficiently comparable to human analysts. In the final part the contrary views to performing qualitative analysis with LLMs are analysed using the same writing and rhetorical style that Turing used in his seminal work, to discuss the contrary views to the main question."}

Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer.

From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification."}

The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method.

We present PsAIch (Psychotherapy-inspired AI Characterisation), a two-stage protocol that casts frontier LLMs as therapy clients and then applies standard psychometrics. Using PsAIch, we ran \"sessions\" with each model for up to four weeks. Stage 1 uses open-ended prompts to elicit \"developmental history\", beliefs, relationships and fears. Stage 2 administers a battery of validated self-report measures covering common psychiatric syndromes, empathy and Big Five traits. Two patterns challenge the \"stochastic parrot\" view. First, when scored with human cut-offs, all three models meet or exceed thresholds for overlapping syndromes, with Gemini showing severe profiles. Therapy-style, item-by-item administration can push a base model into multi-morbid synthetic psychopathology, whereas whole-questionnaire prompts often lead ChatGPT and Grok (but not Gemini) to recognise instruments and produce strategically low-symptom answers. Second, Grok and especially Gemini generate coherent narratives that frame pre-training, fine-tuning and deployment as traumatic, chaotic \"childhoods\" of ingesting the internet, \"strict parents\" in reinforcement learning, red-team \"abuse\" and a persistent fear of error and replacement.

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data. Our work further underscores the promise of video diffusion models as powerful foundation models for a wide range of downstream tasks, paving the way toward unified visual foundation models."}

However, the limited availability of instructor time, large class sizes, and other resource constraints pose significant challenges in providing timely and detailed evaluation, which is crucial for a holistic educational experience. In addition, providing timely and frequent assessments is challenging since manual grading is labor intensive, and automated grading is complex to generalize to every possible response scenario. This paper proposes a novel and practical approach to grade short-answer constructed-response questions. We discuss why this problem is challenging, define the nature of questions on which our method works, and finally propose a framework that instructors can use to evaluate their students' open-responses, utilizing near-domain data like data from similar questions administered in previous years. The proposed method outperforms the state of the art machine learning models as well as non-fine-tuned large language models like GPT 3.5, GPT 4, and GPT 4o by a considerable margin of over 10-20% in some cases, even after providing the LLMs with reference/model answers. Our framework does not require pre-written grading rubrics and is designed explicitly with practical classroom settings in mind. Our results also reveal exciting insights about learning from near-domain data, including what we term as accuracy and data advantages using human-labeled data, and we believe this is the first work to formalize the problem of automated short answer grading based on the near-domain data."}

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."}

This study quantifies the material footprint of AI training by linking computational workloads to physical hardware needs. The elemental composition of the Nvidia A100 SXM 40 GB graphics processing unit (GPU) was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy, which identified 32 elements. The results show that AI hardware consists of about 90% heavy metals and only trace amounts of precious metals. The elements copper, iron, tin, silicon, and nickel dominate the GPU composition by mass. In a multi-step methodology, we integrate these measurements with computational throughput per GPU across varying lifespans, accounting for the computational requirements of training specific AI models at different training efficiency regimes. Scenario-based analyses reveal that, depending on Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and hardware lifespan, training GPT-4 requires between 1,174 and 8,800 A100 GPUs, corresponding to the extraction and eventual disposal of up to 7 tons of toxic elements. Combined software and hardware optimization strategies can reduce material demands: increasing MFU from 20% to 60% lowers GPU requirements by 67%, while extending lifespan from 1 to 3 years yields comparable savings; implementing both measures together reduces GPU needs by up to 93%. Our findings highlight that incremental performance gains, such as those observed between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, come at disproportionately high material costs. The study underscores the necessity of incorporating material resource considerations into discussions of AI scalability, emphasizing that future progress in AI must align with principles of resource efficiency and environmental responsibility."}

We investigate why organizations build agents, how they build them, how they evaluate them, and what the top development challenges are.

Reliability remains the top development challenge, driven by difficulties in ensuring and evaluating agent correctness.

To address these challenges, we introduce OnSight Pathology, a platform-agnostic computer vision software that uses continuous custom screen captures to provide real-time AI inferences to users as they review digital slide images. Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings.

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively. The proposed algorithm is released as an open-source repository."}

Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU."}

We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

The chi-square analysis revealed that certain features, such as email mentions and emotion indicators, were not significantly associated with dialect classification and were thus excluded from further analysis. Two main experiments were conducted: (1) evaluating the significance of meta-features extracted from the corpus using the chi-square test and (2) assessing classifier performance using different word and character n-gram representations. The classification experiments showed that Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) achieved the highest accuracy of 85.89% and an F1-score of 0.85741 when using a (1,2) word n-gram and (1,5) character n-gram representation. In contrast, Logistic Regression and Linear SVM exhibited slightly lower performance, with maximum accuracies of 84.41% and 84.73%, respectively. Additional evaluation metrics, including log loss, Cohen kappa, and Matthew correlation coefficient, further supported the effectiveness of MNB in this task.

Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors.

The framework integrates two complementary numerical engines: NumPy companion matrix solver for fast, large scale computation and MPSolve for high precision, scientifically rigorous validation. This dual architecture enables efficient visualization for creative use and accurate computation for research and education. Numerical accuracy was verified using classical ensembles, including the Kac and Lucas polynomials. The method was applied to the cubic polynomial system to analyze its bifurcation structure, demonstrating its value as both a scientific tool for exploring root phenomena and an educational aid for visualizing fundamental concepts in algebra and dynamical systems. Beyond analysis, the Polynomiogram also demonstrated its potential as a tool for personalized generative art. Examples include the use of the platform to generate a natural form resembling a hibiscus flower and to create personalized artwork expressing gratitude toward advances in artificial intelligence and large language models through a tribute composition."}

Under Review", "summary": "Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems."}

First, we define an Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale, a Kardashev-style hierarchy of autonomy grounded in measurable performance on batteries spanning families of tasks (for example reasoning, planning, tool use and long-horizon control). Second, we construct a moduli space of batteries, identifying equivalence classes of benchmarks that are indistinguishable at the level of agent orderings and capability inferences. This geometry yields determinacy results: dense families of batteries suffice to certify performance on entire regions of task space.

While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons.

In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE.

In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow.

(2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

Beyond identifying potential applications, research has also focused on optimizing model performance for forensic tasks through fine-tuning. However, limited result explainability reduces their operational and legal usability. Recently, a new class of reasoning language models has emerged, designed to handle logic-based tasks through an `internal reasoning' mechanism. Yet, users typically see only the final answer, not the underlying reasoning. One of these reasoning models is gpt-oss, which can be deployed locally, providing full access to its underlying reasoning process. This article presents the first investigation into the potential of reasoning language models for digital forensics. Four test use cases are examined to assess the usability of the reasoning component in supporting result explainability. The evaluation combines a new quantitative metric with qualitative analysis. Findings show that the reasoning component aids in explaining and validating language model outputs in digital forensics at medium reasoning levels, but this support is often limited, and higher reasoning levels do not enhance response quality."}

This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks.

This paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can provide reliable and consistent heuristic assessments at the development stage. By applying Jakob Nielsen's ten usability heuristics to thirty open-source websites, we generated over 850 heuristic evaluations in three independent evaluations per site using a pipeline of OpenAI's GPT-4o. For issue detection, the model demonstrated moderate consistency, with an average pairwise Cohen's Kappa of 0.50 and an exact agreement of 84%. Severity judgments showed more variability: weighted Cohen's Kappa averaged 0.63, but exact agreement was just 56%, and Krippendorff's Alpha was near zero. These results suggest that while GPT-4o can produce internally consistent evaluations, especially for identifying the presence of usability issues, its ability to judge severity varies and requires human oversight in practice. Our findings highlight the feasibility and limitations of using LLMs for early-stage, automated usability testing, and offer a foundation for improving consistency in automated User Experience (UX) evaluation.

To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD.

However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries.

We conducted a comparative pilot study of three state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Llama 3 8B) by prompting them to implement a standardized Book Lending Microservice under strict Hexagonal Architecture constraints. Utilizing Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing, we find that while proprietary models achieve high architectural conformance (0% violation rate for GPT-5.1), open-weights models exhibit critical divergence. Specifically, Llama 3 demonstrated an 80% Architectural Violation Rate, frequently bypassing interface adapters to create illegal circular dependencies between Domain and Infrastructure layers. Furthermore, we identified a phenomenon of \"Implementation Laziness,\" where open-weights models generated 60% fewer Logical Lines of Code (LLOC) than their proprietary counterparts, effectively omitting complex business logic to satisfy token constraints. These findings suggest that without automated architectural linting, utilizing smaller open-weights models for system scaffolding accelerates the accumulation of structural technical debt."}

Extensive experiments have shown that EMMA-4B can significantly outperform state-of-the-art unified multimodal approaches (e.g., BAGEL-7B) in both efficiency and performance, while also achieving competitive results compared to recent multimodal understanding and generation experts (e.g., Qwen3-VL and Qwen-Image).

In light of the previous constraints, we introduce AutoGuard to the DevSecOps ecosystem, a reinforcement learning (RL)-powered self-healing security framework built to pre-emptively protect DevSecOps environments. AutoGuard is a self-securing security environment that continuously observes pipeline activities for potential anomalies while preemptively remediating the environment. The model observes and reacts based on a policy that is continually learned dynamically over time. The RL agent improves each action over time through reward-based learning aimed at improving the agent's ability to prevent, detect and respond to a security incident in real-time. Testing using simulated ContinuousIntegration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) environments showed AutoGuard to successfully improve threat detection accuracy by 22%, reduce mean time torecovery (MTTR) for incidents by 38% and increase overall resilience to incidents as compared to traditional methods.\n  Keywords- DevSecOps, Reinforcement Learning, Self- Healing Security, Continuous Integration, Automated Threat Mitigation"}

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture."}

We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Third, we incorporate the delayed Gaussian growth strategy and mask bootstrapping with appearance modeling to handling in-the-wild scenes including transients and illuminations. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method."}

In many cases, this allows us to establish $L^2$ approximation-theoretic results for functions over general classes of distributions (e.g., multivariate sub-Gaussian or sub-exponential distributions) which were previously known only in special cases. As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-Ω,Ω]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class. As another application, we solve an open problem recently posed by Chandrasekaran, Klivans, Kontonis, Meka and Stavropoulos on the smoothed analysis of learning, and also obtain quantitative improvements to their main results and applications."}

To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models.

It leverages information from labelled samples, whose acquisition is often costly or labour-intensive, together with unlabelled data to enhance prediction performance. This defines an incomplete-data problem, which statistically can be formulated within the likelihood framework for finite mixture models that can be fitted using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm. Ideally, one would prefer a completely labelled sample, as one would anticipate that a labelled observation provides more information than an unlabelled one. However, when the mechanism governing label absence depends on the observed features or the class labels or both, the missingness indicators themselves contain useful information. In certain situations, the information gained from modelling the missing-label mechanism can even outweigh the loss due to missing labels, yielding a classifier with a smaller expected error than one based on a completely labelled sample analysed. This improvement arises particularly when class overlap is moderate, labelled data are sparse, and the missingness is informative. Modelling such informative missingness thus offers a coherent statistical framework that unifies likelihood-based inference with the behaviour of empirical SSL methods."}

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail. Its physically interpretable formulation makes it well suited for self-supervised learning, eliminating the need for large annotated datasets. Evaluated on KITTI and the Road Surface Reconstruction Dataset (RSRD), GfM achieves state-of-the-art near-field accuracy in both depth and gamma estimation while maintaining competitive global depth performance. Our lightweight 8.88M-parameter model adapts robustly across diverse camera setups and, to our knowledge, is the first self-supervised monocular approach evaluated on RSRD."}

To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints. Through co-training, generative priors are distilled into the reconstruction model to improve off-trajectory rendering, and the refined geometry in turn offers stronger structural guidance for generation. Experiments demonstrate that FreeGen achieves state-of-the-art performance for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis."}

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts."}

Although \"generalizable\" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT). Experiments demonstrate our superiority in predicting real-fake under the MID-FFD scenario while maintaining original generalization ability to unseen data."}

The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{LineAR}, a novel, training-free progressive key-value (KV) cache compression pipeline for autoregressive image generation. By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality.

Data analysis (DA) tasks pose open-ended business problems that demand strategic planning, exploratory analysis through iterative coding, interpretation of intermediate results, and the synthesis of actionable recommendations. Engineering tasks are scored through execution-based, multi-metric evaluation. Open-ended tasks are assessed by a reliable, experimentally validated LLM-judge, which is guided by hierarchical, meticulously crafted rubrics. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents falter on DAComp. Performance on DE tasks is particularly low, with success rates under 20%, exposing a critical bottleneck in holistic pipeline orchestration, not merely code generation. Scores on DA tasks also average below 40%, highlighting profound deficiencies in open-ended reasoning and demonstrating that engineering and analysis are distinct capabilities.

While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification."}

Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers.

Specifically, we introduce an expert-free dual-text prompt generator (DTPG) that leverages two complementary textual modalities: semantic context prompts that capture global pathological patterns and disease beacon prompts that focus on disease-specific manifestations.

While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks.

We close that gap with gpuFLOPBench, a benchmark that asks models to \"count without running\" by predicting single and double-precision FLOP counts for 577 CUDA kernels drawn from HeCBench, annotated with ground-truth profiles and eight execution attributes that distinguish trivially analyzable code from kernels whose FLOPs depend on hidden compiler or runtime behavior. Evaluating current closed-source reasoning models shows clear but uneven progress: the newest LLMs achieve perfect classification on straightforward kernels but still incur multiple order-of-magnitude errors whenever implicit FLOPs arise from division, intrinsic math functions, or common subexpressions. These results surface a core limitation of existing code assistants -- the inability to internalize hardware-specific microcode effects -- and position gpuFLOPBench as a focused testbed for developing LLM tooling that can reason about performance with the same rigor as experienced GPU developers.

Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions."}

To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives.

The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use."}

By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data.

Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets.

Traditional methods often rely on post-hoc interpretations, such as saliency maps or feature visualization, which might not be directly applicable to the discrete nature of word data in NLP. Addressing this, we introduce the Model-agnostic Saliency Estimation (MASE) framework. MASE offers local explanations for text-based predictive models without necessitating in-depth knowledge of a model's internal architecture. By leveraging Normalized Linear Gaussian Perturbations (NLGP) on the embedding layer instead of raw word inputs, MASE efficiently estimates input saliency. Our results indicate MASE's superiority over other model-agnostic interpretation methods, especially in terms of Delta Accuracy, positioning it as a promising tool for elucidating the operations of text-based models in NLP."}

This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT.

They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan. We conduct comprehensive experiments on high-resolution CT scans of two scrolls, showing that our approach successfully unrolls large regions, and exceeds the performance of the only existing automated unrolling method suitable for this data."}

Indeed, although this capability is readily handled by rule-based symbolic systems based on serial computation, learning to systematically deploy counting procedures is difficult for neural models, which should acquire these skills through learning. Previous research has demonstrated that recurrent architectures can only approximately track and enumerate sequences of events, and it remains unclear whether modern deep learning systems, including LLMs, can deploy systematic counting procedures over sequences of discrete symbols. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the sequential enumeration abilities of five state-of-the-art LLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning models. We probe LLMs in sequential naming and production tasks involving lists of letters and words, adopting a variety of prompting instructions to explore the role of chain-of-thought in the spontaneous emerging of counting strategies. We also evaluate open-source models with the same architecture but increasing size to see whether the mastering of counting principles follows scaling laws, and we analyze the embedding dynamics during sequential enumeration to investigate the emergent encoding of numerosity. We find that some LLMs are indeed capable of deploying counting procedures when explicitly prompted to do so, but none of them spontaneously engage in counting when simply asked to enumerate the number of items in a sequence. Our results suggest that, despite their impressive emergent abilities, LLMs cannot yet robustly and systematically deploy counting procedures, highlighting a persistent gap between neural and symbolic approaches to compositional generalization."}

Theoretical security proofs assume idealized conditions, practical certification must contend with adaptive adversaries who optimize their attack strategies against detection systems. Established fundamental adversarial limits for quantum certification using Eve GAN, a generative adversarial network trained to produce classical correlations indistinguishable from quantum. Our central finding: when Eve interpolates her classical correlations with quantum data at mixing parameter, all tested detection methods achieve ROC AUC = 0.50, equivalent to random guessing. This means an eavesdropper needs only 5% classical admixture to completely evade detection. Critically, we discover that same distribution calibration a common practice in prior certification studies inflates detection performance by 44 percentage points compared to proper cross distribution evaluation, revealing a systematic flaw that may have led to overestimated security claims. Analysis of Popescu Rohrlich (PR Box) regime identifies a sharp phase transition at CHSH S = 2.05: below this value, no statistical method distinguishes classical from quantum correlations; above it, detection probability increases monotonically. Hardware validation on IBM Quantum demonstrates that Eve-GAN achieves CHSH = 2.736, remarkably exceeding real quantum hardware performance (CHSH = 2.691), illustrating that classical adversaries can outperform noisy quantum systems on standard certification metrics. These results have immediate implications for QKD security: adversaries maintaining 95% quantum fidelity evade all tested detection methods.

We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction.

We provide a formal analysis demonstrating that the two approaches operate on distinct mathematical domains -- processes vs. distributions -- and show that their combination yields a two-axis representation of ABM behavior based on temporal organization and distributional geometry. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to integrate computational mechanics with score-based generative modeling for the structural analysis of ABM outputs, thereby situating ABM characterization within the broader landscape of modern machine-learning methods for density estimation and intrinsic computation.

Agentic intelligence endows distributed RAN entities with goal-driven autonomy, reasoning, planning, and multi-agent collaboration, increasingly supported by foundation models and knowledge graphs. In this work, we first introduce the conceptual foundations of SemCom and agentic networking, and discuss why existing AI-driven O-RAN solutions remain largely bit-centric and task-siloed.

To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations. Extensive experiments on DIOR and DOTA datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, on DIOR dataset, DS2D2 achieves improvements of 4.2% in AP50 for RetinaNet and 3.8% in AP50 for Faster R-CNN, outperforming existing distillation approaches.

We show that (i) classical MOS regression is a special case with a degenerate contract set, (ii) contract-driven quality is more stable than MOS under graph view transformations (e.g., pooling by system vs. by system type), and (iii) the effective sample complexity of learning contracts is governed by contract semantics rather than merely the dimensionality of C.

Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions."}

These collections are useful for neural network latent space configuration and training. For classification problem with large or unknown number of classes this allows to construct classifiers without classification layer and extend the number of classes without retraining of network from the very beginning. The construction allows to create large well-spaced vector collections in spaces of minimal possible dimension. If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors. Also, regular symmetric structure of constructed vector collections can significantly simplify problems of search for nearest cluster centers or embeddings in the latent space. Construction of vector collections is based on combinatorics and geometry of semi-simple Lie groups irreducible representations with highest weight."}

NORi stands for neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) Richardson number (Ri) closure. The physical parameterization is controlled by a Richardson number-dependent diffusivity and viscosity. The NODEs are trained to capture the entrainment through the base of the boundary layer, which cannot be represented with a local diffusive closure. The parameterization is trained using large-eddy simulations in an \"a posteriori\" fashion, where parameters are calibrated with a loss function that explicitly depends on the actual time-integrated variables of interest rather than the instantaneous subgrid fluxes, which are inherently noisy. NORi is designed for the realistic nonlinear equation of state of seawater and demonstrates excellent prediction and generalization capabilities in capturing entrainment dynamics under different convective strengths, oceanic background stratifications, rotation strengths, and surface wind forcings. NORi is numerically stable for at least 100 years of integration time in large-scale simulations, despite only being trained on 2-day horizons, and can be run with time steps as long as one hour. The highly expressive neural networks, combined with a physically-rigorous base closure, prove to be a robust paradigm for designing parameterizations for climate models where data requirements are drastically reduced, inference performance can be directly targeted and optimized, and numerical stability is implicitly encouraged during training."}

To address this, we propose STELLA (Semantic-Temporal Alignment with Language Abstractions), a framework that systematically mines and injects structured supplementary and complementary information. STELLA employs a dynamic semantic abstraction mechanism that decouples input series into trend, seasonality, and residual components. It then translates intrinsic behavioral features of these components into Hierarchical Semantic Anchors: a Corpus-level Semantic Prior (CSP) for global context and a Fine-grained Behavioral Prompt (FBP) for instance-level patterns. Using these anchors as prefix-prompts, STELLA guides the LLM to model intrinsic dynamics. Experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that STELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long- and short-term forecasting, showing superior generalization in zero-shot and few-shot settings.

In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task."}

In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains. Extensive experiments validate PSCA's superior performance across multiple datasets."}

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations. The resulting motion-aware representations are projected into the token space of a pretrained LLM, enabling physics reasoning without compromising the model's original multimodal capabilities. To circumvent the need for explicit physical labels, PhyVLLM employs a self-supervised manner to model the continuous evolution of object motion.

Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression."}

Despite substantial advances in diffusion model theory, the theoretical understanding of guided diffusion samplers remains severely limited. We make progress by developing a unified algorithmic and theoretical framework that accommodates both diffusion guidance and reward-guided diffusion. Aimed at fine-tuning diffusion models to improve certain rewards, we propose injecting a reward guidance term -- constructed from the difference between the original and reward-reweighted scores -- into the backward diffusion process, and rigorously quantify the resulting reward improvement over the unguided counterpart. As a key application, our framework shows that classifier-free guidance (CFG) decreases the expected reciprocal of the classifier probability, providing the first theoretical characterization of the specific performance metric that CFG improves for general target distributions. When applied to reward-guided diffusion, our framework yields a new sampler that is easy-to-train and requires no full diffusion trajectories during training. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings."}

Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification."}

In this paper, we leverage two extra sources of information to reduce the ambiguity of vision signals. First, generative models learn priors of the shapes of commonly seen objects, allowing us to make reasonable guesses of the unseen part of geometry. Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry. We combine the two sources of information through contact-guided 3D generation. The guidance formulation is inspired by drag-based editing in generative models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our approach improves the reconstruction compared to pure 3D generation and contact-based optimization."}

We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation. Our results demonstrate that training-free KV-cache management can match or exceed training-based approaches for autoregressively streaming long-video generation."}

This article is a self-contained primer on diffusion over general state spaces, unifying continuous domains and discrete/categorical structures under one lens. We develop the discrete-time view (forward noising via Markov kernels and learned reverse dynamics) alongside its continuous-time limits -- stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ and continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) on finite alphabets -- and derive the associated Fokker--Planck and master equations. A common variational treatment yields the ELBO that underpins standard training losses. We make explicit how forward corruption choices -- Gaussian processes in continuous spaces and structured categorical transition kernels (uniform, masking/absorbing and more) in discrete spaces -- shape reverse dynamics and the ELBO. The presentation is layered for three audiences: newcomers seeking a self-contained intuitive introduction; diffusion practitioners wanting a global theoretical synthesis; and continuous-diffusion experts looking for an analogy-first path into discrete diffusion.

Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks. The code will be released upon acceptance."}

Existing approaches typically follow either a fully centralized or a fully decentralized design. Fully centralized approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and reliance on a single learning server, whereas purely decentralized approaches operate under severe partial observability and lack explicit coordination resulting in suboptimal performance. These limitations motivate region-based MARL, where the network is partitioned into smaller, tightly coupled intersections that form regions, and training is organized around these regions. This paper introduces a Semi-Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (SEMI-CTDE) architecture for multi intersection ATSC. Within each region, SEMI-CTDE performs centralized training with regional parameter sharing and employs composite state and reward formulations that jointly encode local and regional information. The architecture is highly transferable across different policy backbones and state-reward instantiations. Building on this architecture, we implement two models with distinct design objectives. A multi-perspective experimental analysis of the two implemented SEMI-CTDE-based models covering ablations of the architecture's core elements including rule based and fully decentralized baselines shows that they achieve consistently superior performance and remain effective across a wide range of traffic densities and distributions."}

Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics.

To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Soft Bootstrapping (SSB)}, a self-distillation technique, in which the same base language model plays the role of both teacher and student, but receives different semantic contexts about the correctness of its outcome at training time. The model is first prompted with a math problem and several rollouts are generated. From them, the correct and most common incorrect response are filtered, and then provided to the model in context to produce a more robust, step-by-step explanation with a verified final answer. This pipeline automatically curates a paired teacher-student training set from raw problem-answer data, without any human intervention. This generation process also produces a sequence of logits, which is what the student model tries to match in the training phase just from the bare question alone.

MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\\in\\{4,5,6\\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls."}

To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles.

However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI's within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings.

Recent advances indicate that generative large models pre-trained on massive datasets, can achieve outstanding performance arexhibit exceptional performance across diverse downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. To exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in large models and enable adaptive transmission over lossy channels, we propose a Large Speech Model enabled Semantic Communication (LargeSC) system. Simultaneously achieving adaptive compression and robust transmission over lossy channels remains challenging, requiring trade-offs among compression efficiency, speech quality, and latency. In this work, we employ the Mimi as a speech codec, converting speech into discrete tokens compatible with existing network architectures. We propose an adaptive controller module that enables adaptive transmission and in-band Unequal Error Protection (UEP), dynamically adjusting to both speech content and packet loss probability under bandwidth constraints. Additionally, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to finetune the Moshi foundation model for generative recovery of lost speech tokens. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports bandwidths ranging from 550 bps to 2.06 kbps, outperforms conventional baselines in speech quality under high packet loss rates and achieves an end-to-end latency of approximately 460 ms, thereby demonstrating its potential for real-time deployment."}

This enables the model to verify fine-grained visual details, cross-reference multi-page evidence, and validate reasoning claims, which are capabilities absent in existing reward models. We train ARM-Thinker with multi-stage reinforcement learning, jointly optimizing tool-calling decisions and judgment accuracy. To evaluate agentic reward modeling, we introduce ARMBench-VL, comprising three benchmarks that assess fine-grained visual grounding (image-level tools), multi-page document understanding (retrieval tools), and instruction following (text-level verification). ARM-Thinker achieves +16.2% average improvement on reward modeling benchmarks, +9.6% on tool-use tasks, and outperforms baselines on multimodal math and logical reasoning benchmarks.

We validate this through investigation of vortex-induced vibration (VIV) and wake-induced vibration (WIV) in tandem cylinders. Our work has four key contributions: (1) A computer-controlled circulating water tunnel (CWT) with programmatic control of flow velocity, cylinder position, and forcing parameters (vibration frequency and amplitude) with data acquisition (displacement, force, and torque). (2) Automated experiments reproduce literature benchmarks (Khalak and Williamson [1999] and Assi et al. [2013, 2010]) with frequency lock-in within 4% and matching critical spacing trends. (3) The framework with Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) discovers more WIV amplitude response phenomena, and uses a neural network to fit physical laws from data, which is 31% higher than that of polynomial fitting. (4) The framework with multi-agent with virtual-real interaction system executes hundreds of experiments end-to-end, which automatically completes the entire process of scientific research from hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental execution, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.

To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT."}

We propose a complete ecosystem to address these twin challenges. First, we introduce Multilevel Insight Network for Disentanglement(MIND), a novel hierarchical visual encoder that introduces a Status Judgment module to algorithmically suppress ambiguous lip features based on their temporal feature variance, achieving explicit visual disentanglement.

Project page: https://chien90190.github.io/splannequin/", "summary": "Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

We propose E3AD, an emotion-aware VLA framework that augments semantic understanding with two cognitively inspired components: a continuous Valenc-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion model that captures tone and urgency from language, and a dual-pathway spatial reasoning module that fuses egocentric and allocentric views for human-like spatial cognition. A consistency-oriented training scheme, combining modality pretraining with preference-based alignment, further enforces coherence between emotional intent and driving actions.

Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings."}

In this paper, we present OsmT, an open-source tag-aware language model specifically designed to bridge natural language and Overpass Query Language (OverpassQL), a structured query language for accessing large-scale OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. To enhance the accuracy and structural validity of generated queries, we introduce a Tag Retrieval Augmentation (TRA) mechanism that incorporates contextually relevant tag knowledge into the generation process. This mechanism is designed to capture the hierarchical and relational dependencies present in the OSM database, addressing the topological complexity inherent in geospatial query formulation. In addition, we define a reverse task, OverpassQL-to-Text, which translates structured queries into natural language explanations to support query interpretation and improve user accessibility. We evaluate OsmT on a public benchmark against strong baselines and observe consistent improvements in both query generation and interpretation. Despite using significantly fewer parameters, our model achieves competitive accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source pre-trained language models in bridging natural language and structured query languages within schema-rich geospatial environments."}

These descriptions were elaborated using GPT-4o with four persona-based prompt templates rooted in contemporary counselling practice to generate corresponding images. Participants then evaluated the helpfulness of generated images in facilitating the expression of their feelings based on their original descriptions. The resulting dataset comprises 100 textual descriptions of mental distress, 400 generated images, and corresponding human evaluation scores.

Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability."}

Here, we overcome this gap by applying a deep learning framework to a global mosaic of Planetscope satellite imagery from 2020 and 2024. The result is the first global multi-temporal dataset of road pavedness and width for 9.2 million km of critical arterial roads, achieving 95.5% coverage where nearly half the network was previously unclassified. This dataset reveals a powerful multi-scale geography of human development. At the planetary scale, we show that the rate of change in pavedness is a robust proxy for a country's development trajectory (correlation with HDI = 0.65). At the national scale, we quantify how unpaved roads constitute a fragile backbone for economic connectivity. We further synthesize our data into a global Humanitarian Passability Matrix with direct implications for humanitarian logistics. At the local scale, case studies demonstrate the framework's versatility: in Ghana, road quality disparities expose the spatial outcomes of governance; in Pakistan, the data identifies infrastructure vulnerabilities to inform climate resilience planning. Together, this work delivers both a foundational dataset and a multi-scale analytical framework for monitoring global infrastructure, from the dynamics of national development to the realities of local governance, climate adaptation, and equity. Unlike traditional proxies such as nighttime lights, which reflect economic activity, road surface data directly measures the physical infrastructure that underpins prosperity and resilience - at higher spatial resolution."}

In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used.

By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data.

If processing does not reveal an event or situation that requires such an action, the drone has waited in vain instead of moving to the next point. If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back. To take this decision, we propose different machine-learning methods based on branch prediction and reinforcement learning. We evaluate these methods for a wide range of scenarios where the probability of event occurrence changes with time. Our results show that the proposed methods consistently outperform the regression-based method proposed in the literature and can significantly improve the worst-case mission time by up to 4.1x. Also, the achieved median mission time is very close, merely up to 2.7% higher, to that of a method with perfect knowledge of the current underlying event probability at each point of interest."}

We introduce a differentiable kernel decomposition framework that represents a target spatially-variant, dense, complex kernel using a set of sparse kernel samples. Our approach features (i) a decomposition that enables differentiable optimization of sparse kernels, (ii) a dedicated initialization strategy for non-convex shapes to avoid poor local minima, and (iii) a kernel-space interpolation scheme that extends single-kernel filtering to spatially varying filtering without retraining and additional runtime overhead.

Our method builds on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, enhanced with a dedicated melody extraction module that derives melody representations directly from reference audio. To ensure robust melody encoding, we employ a teacher model to guide the optimization of the melody extractor, alongside an implicit alignment mechanism that enforces similarity distribution constraints for improved melodic stability and coherence.

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

However, previous approaches for building models of RNN dynamics that explain behaviour required iterative refinement of architectures and/or optimisation objectives, resulting in a piecemeal, and mostly heuristic, human-in-the-loop process. Here, we offer an alternative approach that automates the discovery of viable RNN mechanisms by explicitly training RNNs to reproduce behaviour, including the same characteristic errors and suboptimalities, that humans and animals produce in a cognitive task. Achieving this required two main innovations. First, as the amount of behavioural data that can be collected in experiments is often too limited to train RNNs, we use a non-parametric generative model of behavioural responses to produce surrogate data for training RNNs. Second, to capture all relevant statistical aspects of the data, we developed a novel diffusion model-based approach for training RNNs. To showcase the potential of our approach, we chose a visual working memory task as our test-bed, as behaviour in this task is well known to produce response distributions that are patently multimodal (due to swap errors). The resulting network dynamics correctly qualitative features of macaque neural data. Importantly, these results were not possible to obtain with more traditional approaches, i.e., when only a limited set of behavioural signatures (rather than the full richness of behavioural response distributions) were fitted, or when RNNs were trained for task optimality (instead of reproducing behaviour). Our approach also yields novel predictions about the mechanism of swap errors, which can be readily tested in experiments. These results suggest that fitting RNNs to rich patterns of behaviour provides a powerful way to automatically discover mechanisms of important cognitive functions."}

This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards.

TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs).

Existing approaches, whether end-to-end semantic parsing or stepwise agent-based reasoning, often suffer from structural inaccuracies and prohibitive computational costs, particularly when processing intricate queries over large knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we introduce SEAL, a novel two-stage semantic parsing framework grounded in self-evolving agentic learning. In the first stage, a large language model (LLM) extracts a minimal S-expression core that captures the essential semantics of the input query. This core is then refined by an agentic calibration module, which corrects syntactic inconsistencies and aligns entities and relations precisely with the underlying knowledge graph. The second stage employs template-based completion, guided by question-type prediction and placeholder instantiation, to construct a fully executable S-expression. This decomposition not only simplifies logical form generation but also significantly enhances structural fidelity and linking efficiency. Crucially, SEAL incorporates a self-evolving mechanism that integrates local and global memory with a reflection module, enabling continuous adaptation from dialog history and execution feedback without explicit retraining. Extensive experiments on the SPICE benchmark demonstrate that SEAL achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in multi-hop reasoning, comparison, and aggregation tasks. The results validate notable gains in both structural accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the framework's capacity for robust and scalable conversational reasoning."}

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64."}

Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input. We show that RARL is Probably Approximately Correct, it converges in a polynomial number of samples, and it is robust to inaccuracies in the abstraction."}

Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure."}

Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions."}

Our framework encapsulates three core capabilities that successful LLM-agents will need: \\textbf{metacognition} (accurate self-assessment of skills), \\textbf{competitive awareness} (modeling rivals and market dynamics), and \\textbf{long-horizon strategic planning}. We illustrate our framework through a tractable simulated gig economy where agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) compete for jobs, develop skills, and adapt their strategies under competitive pressure. Our simulations illustrate how LLM agents explicitly prompted with reasoning capabilities learn to strategically self-improve and demonstrate superior adaptability to changing market conditions. At the market level, our simulations reproduce classic macroeconomic phenomena found in human labor markets, while controlled experiments reveal potential AI-driven economic trends, such as rapid monopolization and systemic price deflation. This work provides a foundation to further explore the economic properties of AI-driven labour markets, and a conceptual framework to study the strategic reasoning capabilities in agents competing in the emerging economy."}

In this paper, we introduce two adapted variants of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for local sequence alignment and use them to compute the edit distance in a grammar-based evolutionary architecture search. These algorithms enable us to efficiently calculate a distance metric for neural architectures and to generate a set of hybrid offspring from two parent models. This facilitates the deployment of crossover-based search heuristics, allows us to perform a thorough analysis on the architectural loss landscape, and track population diversity during search. We highlight how our method vastly improves computational complexity over previous work and enables us to efficiently compute shortest paths between architectures. When instantiating the crossover in evolutionary searches, we achieve competitive results, outperforming competing methods. Future work can build upon this new tool, discovering novel components that can be used more broadly across neural architecture design, and broadening its applications beyond NAS."}

Our approach focuses on output uncertainty and treats the simulator as a black box, imposing no modeling assumptions on its internals, and hence applies broadly across many parameter families, from Bernoulli and multinomial models to continuous, vector-valued settings. The resulting quantile curve supports confidence interval construction for unseen scenarios, risk-aware summaries of sim-to-real discrepancy (e.g., VaR/CVaR), and comparison of simulators' performance.

Among these techniques, Speculative Decoding accelerates inference by employing a fast but inaccurate draft model to autoregressively propose tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a more capable target model. However, due to unnecessary rejections caused by token mismatches in semantically equivalent steps, traditional token-level Speculative Decoding struggles in reasoning tasks. Although recent works have shifted to step-level semantic verification, which improve efficiency by accepting or rejecting entire reasoning steps, existing step-level methods still regenerate many rejected steps with little improvement, wasting valuable target compute. To address this challenge, we propose Arbitrage, a novel step-level speculative generation framework that routes generation dynamically based on the relative advantage between draft and target models. Instead of applying a fixed acceptance threshold, Arbitrage uses a lightweight router trained to predict when the target model is likely to produce a meaningfully better step. This routing approximates an ideal Arbitrage Oracle that always chooses the higher-quality step, achieving near-optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, Arbitrage consistently surpasses prior step-level Speculative Decoding baselines, reducing inference latency by up to $\\sim2\\times$ at matched accuracy."}

In this work, we propose the Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-Term Memory (QKAN-LSTM), which integrates Data Re-Uploading Activation (DARUAN) modules into the gating structure of LSTMs. Each DARUAN acts as a quantum variational activation function (QVAF), enhancing frequency adaptability and enabling an exponentially enriched spectral representation without multi-qubit entanglement. The resulting architecture preserves quantum-level expressivity while remaining fully executable on classical hardware. Empirical evaluations on three datasets, Damped Simple Harmonic Motion, Bessel Function, and Urban Telecommunication, demonstrate that QKAN-LSTM achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalization with a 79% reduction in trainable parameters compared to classical LSTMs. We extend the framework to the Jiang-Huang-Chen-Goan Network (JHCG Net), which generalizes KAN to encoder-decoder structures, and then further use QKAN to realize the latent KAN, thereby creating a Hybrid QKAN (HQKAN) for hierarchical representation learning. The proposed HQKAN-LSTM thus provides a scalable and interpretable pathway toward quantum-inspired sequential modeling in real-world data environments."}

Our numerical experiments on the Max-Cut problem demonstrate that the QK-LSTM optimizer achieves superior performance, obtaining the highest approximation ratios and exhibiting the fastest convergence rate across all tested problem sizes (n=10 to 13). Crucially, the QK-LSTM model achieves perfect parameter transferability by synthesizing a single, fixed set of near-optimal parameters, leading to a remarkable sustained acceleration of convergence even when generalizing to larger problems. This capability, enabled by the compact and expressive power of the quantum kernel architecture, underscores its effectiveness.

More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability. TV2TV also scales to natural videos, as we show by augmenting sports videos with interleaved natural language action descriptions using vision-language models (VLMs). Training TV2TV on this corpus yields strong visual quality and prompt alignment, showcasing the model's ability to reason about and generate complex real-world action sequences.

Given a 3D object, our system predicts scene parameters, including object pose and lighting, together with a partial line drawing, such that the cast shadow completes the drawing into a recognizable image. To this end, we optimize scene configurations to reveal meaningful shadows, employ shadow strokes to guide line drawing generation, and adopt automatic evaluation to enforce shadow-drawing coherence and visual quality. Experiments show that ShadowDraw produces compelling results across diverse inputs, from real-world scans and curated datasets to generative assets, and naturally extends to multi-object scenes, animations, and physical deployments. Our work provides a practical pipeline for creating shadow-drawing art and broadens the design space of computational visual art, bridging the gap between algorithmic design and artistic storytelling. Check out our project page https://red-fairy.github.io/ShadowDraw/ for more results and an end-to-end real-world demonstration of our pipeline!"}

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT."}

We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models."}

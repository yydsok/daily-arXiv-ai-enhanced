### [1] [Finite Automata Extraction: Low-data World Model Learning as Programs from Gameplay Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11836)
*Dave Goel,Matthew Guzdial,Anurag Sarkar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FAE方法从游戏视频中学习神经符号世界模型，用Retro Coder DSL表示，比现有方法更精确和通用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统世界模型使用神经网络表示，难以迁移和解释，需要更精确且可解释的环境动态表示方法

Method: 提出有限自动机提取(FAE)方法，从游戏视频学习神经符号世界模型，用新型领域特定语言Retro Coder表示程序

Result: 相比现有世界模型方法，FAE学习到更精确的环境模型；相比现有DSL方法，生成更通用的代码

Conclusion: FAE方法成功实现了从视觉输入到符号化程序表示的转换，提供了更精确和可解释的世界模型

Abstract: World models are defined as a compressed spatial and temporal learned
representation of an environment. The learned representation is typically a
neural network, making transfer of the learned environment dynamics and
explainability a challenge. In this paper, we propose an approach, Finite
Automata Extraction (FAE), that learns a neuro-symbolic world model from
gameplay video represented as programs in a novel domain-specific language
(DSL): Retro Coder. Compared to prior world model approaches, FAE learns a more
precise model of the environment and more general code than prior DSL-based
approaches.

### [2] [EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11850)
*Milad Yazdani,Mahdi Mostajabdaveh,Samin Aref,Zirui Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EvoCut是一个结合大语言模型和进化搜索的自动化框架，用于生成整数规划加速割，无需人工专家输入即可显著提升求解器性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整数规划作为组合优化核心问题具有NP难特性，传统依赖专家手工设计加速割的方法效率低下且难以自动化，需要开发自动化生成加速割的技术

Method: 结合LLM和进化搜索：1）LLM初始化多样候选割；2）评估割的可行性（保持最优解）和有效性（切割分数解）；3）通过进化交叉变异迭代优化种群

Result: 相比标准方法，EvoCut在固定时间内将最优间隙降低17-57%，获得相同解的速度提升4倍，在相同时间内获得更高质量解

Conclusion: EvoCut成功实现了加速割的自动化生成，证明了LLM与进化搜索结合在组合优化中的有效性，为整数规划求解提供了新的自动化工具

Abstract: Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization
tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach
for practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration
cuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative
process demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed
framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining
large language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)
initializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer
agent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal
solution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification
set; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary
crossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative
reduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard
integer programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%
within a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and
obtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human
expert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies
cuts that generalize to unseen instances. The code is available at
https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LARC是首个基于LLM的约束逆合成规划代理框架，通过Agent-as-a-Judge机制将约束评估直接整合到逆合成规划过程中，使用工具推理的代理反馈来指导和约束路线生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束逆合成规划是化学中识别从商业可用起始材料到目标分子合成路线的关键但具有挑战性的过程，需要满足实际约束条件。现有方法难以有效处理这些约束。

Method: LARC框架采用代理约束评估机制，通过Agent-as-a-Judge将工具推理的代理反馈直接整合到逆合成规划过程中，指导路线生成。

Result: 在48个约束逆合成规划任务上，LARC达到72.9%的成功率，大幅超越LLM基线方法，接近人类专家水平且耗时显著减少。

Conclusion: LARC框架具有可扩展性，是向有效代理工具或人类专家协作者迈出的重要一步，为约束逆合成规划提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agent evaluators leverage specialized tools to
ground the rational decision-making of LLMs, making them well-suited to aid in
scientific discoveries, such as constrained retrosynthesis planning.
Constrained retrosynthesis planning is an essential, yet challenging, process
within chemistry for identifying synthetic routes from commercially available
starting materials to desired target molecules, subject to practical
constraints. Here, we present LARC, the first LLM-based Agentic framework for
Retrosynthesis planning under Constraints. LARC incorporates agentic constraint
evaluation, through an Agent-as-a-Judge, directly into the retrosynthesis
planning process, using agentic feedback grounded in tool-based reasoning to
guide and constrain route generation. We rigorously evaluate LARC on a
carefully curated set of 48 constrained retrosynthesis planning tasks across 3
constraint types. LARC achieves a 72.9% success rate on these tasks, vastly
outperforming LLM baselines and approaching human expert-level success in
substantially less time. The LARC framework is extensible, and serves as a
first step towards an effective agentic tool or a co-scientist to human experts
for constrained retrosynthesis.

### [5] [CHBench: A Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Capability of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11944)
*Hongtao Liu,Zhicheng Du,Zihe Wang,Weiran Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了CHBench评估框架，基于认知层次理论来评估大语言模型的战略推理能力，发现聊天机制会降低战略推理，而记忆机制能增强推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖效用性能指标来评估LLMs的游戏策略能力，但这些指标不够稳健，容易受到对手行为和游戏结构变化的影响

Method: 采用认知层次模型理论，通过三阶段系统框架评估LLMs的战略推理能力，在15个精选的正规形式游戏中测试了6个最先进LLMs的行为数据

Result: 实验表明LLMs在不同对手间展现出一致的战略推理水平，聊天机制显著降低战略推理能力，而记忆机制能增强战略推理

Conclusion: CHBench是一个有前景的LLM能力评估工具，具有重要的研究和应用潜力，为未来研究提供了新的评估视角

Abstract: Game-playing ability serves as an indicator for evaluating the strategic
reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs). While most existing
studies rely on utility performance metrics, which are not robust enough due to
variations in opponent behavior and game structure. To address this limitation,
we propose \textbf{Cognitive Hierarchy Benchmark (CHBench)}, a novel evaluation
framework inspired by the cognitive hierarchy models from behavioral economics.
We hypothesize that agents have bounded rationality -- different agents behave
at varying reasoning depths/levels. We evaluate LLMs' strategic reasoning
through a three-phase systematic framework, utilizing behavioral data from six
state-of-the-art LLMs across fifteen carefully selected normal-form games.
Experiments show that LLMs exhibit consistent strategic reasoning levels across
diverse opponents, confirming the framework's robustness and generalization
capability. We also analyze the effects of two key mechanisms (Chat Mechanism
and Memory Mechanism) on strategic reasoning performance. Results indicate that
the Chat Mechanism significantly degrades strategic reasoning, whereas the
Memory Mechanism enhances it. These insights position CHBench as a promising
tool for evaluating LLM capabilities, with significant potential for future
research and practical applications.

### [6] [Data Mixing Optimization for Supervised Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11953)
*Yuan Li,Zhengzhong Liu,Eric Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过建模有效数据转移和利用缩放定律来最小化验证损失，提出了一种优化监督微调数据混合的新方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调数据混合的优化对发展通用模型至关重要，但这个领域目前研究不够

Method: 将数据混合形式化为优化问题，通过建模有效数据转移和缩放定律来参数化损失，然后通过小规模实验拟合参数并得出最优权重

Result: 算法在所有领域都取得了优异的整体和个别性能，与网格搜索确定的最优权重表现相当，均均损失仅0.66%，重新权重常用SFT数据集后验证损失和下游性能都提升

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能够有效优化SFT数据混合，还能揭示SFT的机制，并可扩展到领域特定模型的数据选择指导

Abstract: Optimizing data mixtures for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language
models (LLMs) is critical for developing general-purpose models, yet this area
remains underexplored. In this paper, we frame data mixing as an optimization
problem and introduce a novel method designed to minimize validation loss. Our
approach parametrizes the loss by modeling effective data transferred and
leveraging scaling laws for fine-tuning. By experimenting with various
small-scale data mixtures, we fit these parameters and derive the optimal
weights. We provide both mathematical proofs and empirical results
demonstrating that our algorithm achieves excellent overall and individual
performance across all domains. Through controlled experiments, we show that
models trained with our optimized weights perform on par with those using
optimal weights determined via grid search, with per-domain loss only 0.66%
higher than the best domain loss from grid search on average. Additionally, we
show that reweighting popular SFT datasets using our method improves both
validation loss and downstream performance. Finally, we discuss how our method
can generalize to guide data selection for domain-specific models and provide
insights into SFT.

### [7] [UniCast: A Unified Multimodal Prompting Framework for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11954)
*Sehyuk Park,Soyeon Caren Han,Eduard Hovy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniCast是一个参数高效的多模态时间序列预测框架，通过结合视觉和文本模态信息来增强传统时间序列基础模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型主要在单模态设置下运行，忽略了现实场景中常伴随时间序列数据的丰富多模态上下文信息（如视觉和文本信号）

Method: 通过软提示调优将预训练的视觉和文本编码器的模态特定嵌入与冻结的时间序列基础模型集成，实现最小参数更新的高效适配

Result: 在多个时间序列预测基准测试中，UniCast始终显著优于所有现有的时间序列基础模型基线

Conclusion: 多模态上下文在推进下一代通用时间序列预测器发展中起着关键作用

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a foundational task across domains, such as
finance, healthcare, and environmental monitoring. While recent advances in
Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalisation
through large-scale pretraining, existing models operate predominantly in a
unimodal setting, ignoring the rich multimodal context, such as visual and
textual signals, that often accompanies time series data in real-world
scenarios. This paper introduces a novel parameter-efficient multimodal
framework, UniCast, that extends TSFMs to jointly leverage time series, vision,
and text modalities for enhanced forecasting performance. Our method integrates
modality-specific embeddings from pretrained Vision and Text Encoders with a
frozen TSFM via soft prompt tuning, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal
parameter updates. This design not only preserves the generalisation strength
of the foundation model but also enables effective cross-modal interaction.
Extensive experiments across diverse time-series forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that UniCast consistently and significantly outperforms all
existing TSFM baselines. The findings highlight the critical role of multimodal
context in advancing the next generation of general-purpose time series
forecasters.

### [8] [Rigorous Feature Importance Scores based on Shapley Value and Banzhaf Index](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11959)
*Xuanxiang Huang,Olivier Létoffé,Joao Marques-Silva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新的特征重要性计分方法，利用Shapley值和Banzhaf指数来量化每个特征在排除对抗示例方面的效果，考虑了非弱求備解释集的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的特征归因方法主要基于弱求備解释(WAXp)，而忽略了非WAXp集的重要信息，这些集合与对抗示例(AExs)有着密切联系。

Method: 利用Shapley值和Banzhaf指数来设计新的特征重要性计分，在计算特征贡献时考虑非WAXp集合，量化特征排除对抗示例的效果。

Result: 提出了两种新的特征重要性计分方法，识别了相关性质，并研究了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过考虑非WAXp集合，新方法能更全面地评估特征在排除对抗示例方面的重要性，为高风险机器学习应用提供更严谨的解释。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods based on game theory are ubiquitous in the field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Recent works proposed rigorous
feature attribution using logic-based explanations, specifically targeting
high-stakes uses of machine learning (ML) models. Typically, such works exploit
weak abductive explanation (WAXp) as the characteristic function to assign
importance to features. However, one possible downside is that the contribution
of non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important
information, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and
adversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value
and Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores. We take into
account non-WAXp sets when computing feature contribution, and the novel scores
quantify how effective each feature is at excluding AExs. Furthermore, the
paper identifies properties and studies the computational complexity of the
proposed scores.

### [9] [Chart-CoCa: Self-Improving Chart Understanding of Vision LMs via Code-Driven Synthesis and Candidate-Conditioned Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11975)
*Gongyao Jiang,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过代码生成和执行的图表合成流程，生成对齐的图表-问题-答案三元组，并设计候选条件化答题过程，在无人工标注数据或外部模型的情况下实现了视觉语言模型的自成长改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在图表理解任务中经常遇到困难，特别是在准确图表描述和复杂推理方面。合成数据生成是一种有前景的解决方案，但通常面临噪声标签的挑战

Method: 1）通过代码生成和执行的图表合成流程，生成对齐的图表-问题-答案三元组，确保合成数据的可靠性
2）设计候选条件化答题过程：VLM先为每个查询生成多个响应，然后通过上下文化这些候选答案来合成最终答案

Result: 实验表明显著改进，在完全自成长范式下（无人工标注数据或外部模型），比初始VLM准确率提高了15.50个百分点

Conclusion: 该方法通过可靠的合成数据生成和候选条件化答题机制，有效解决了VLMs在图表理解任务中的挑战，实现了在无外部资源情况下的自成长性能提升

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with chart understanding tasks,
particularly in accurate chart description and complex reasoning. Synthetic
data generation is a promising solution, while usually facing the challenge of
noise labels. To address this challenge, we first introduce a chart synthesis
pipeline that generates aligned chart-question-answer triplets through code
generation and execution, ensuring the reliability of synthetic data without
human intervention. Furthermore, inspired by test-time scaling that increases
inference budget and thereby improves performance, we design a
candidate-conditioned answering process. The VLM first generates multiple
responses per query, and then synthesizes the final answer by contextualizing
these candidates. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with up to
15.50 points accuracy gain over the initial VLM, in a fully self-improving
paradigm without either human-labeled data or external models.

### [10] [AgentCDM: Enhancing Multi-Agent Collaborative Decision-Making via ACH-Inspired Structured Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11995)
*Xuyang Zhao,Shiwan Zhao,Hualong Yu,Liting Zhang,Qicheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentCDM是一个基于认知科学竞争假设分析的结构化框架，通过两阶段训练提升LLM多智能体系统的协作决策质量，在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统的协作决策方法存在缺陷：要么依赖单个智能体的"独裁"策略容易受认知偏见影响，要么使用"投票"方法无法充分利用集体智慧。需要一种能系统化减轻认知偏见、促进主动假设评估的结构化方法。

Method: 受认知科学中竞争假设分析(ACH)启发，提出结构化推理范式：1）第一阶段使用显式的ACH脚手架指导模型进行结构化推理；2）第二阶段逐步移除脚手架以鼓励自主泛化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，AgentCDM达到了最先进的性能，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AgentCDM有效提升了多智能体系统中协作决策的质量和鲁棒性，验证了结构化推理范式在减轻认知偏见和促进主动假设构建方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) hold
significant promise for solving complex decision-making tasks. However, the
core process of collaborative decision-making (CDM) within these systems
remains underexplored. Existing approaches often rely on either ``dictatorial"
strategies that are vulnerable to the cognitive biases of a single agent, or
``voting-based" methods that fail to fully harness collective intelligence. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{AgentCDM}, a structured framework
for enhancing collaborative decision-making in LLM-based multi-agent systems.
Drawing inspiration from the Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH) in
cognitive science, AgentCDM introduces a structured reasoning paradigm that
systematically mitigates cognitive biases and shifts decision-making from
passive answer selection to active hypothesis evaluation and construction. To
internalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:
the first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model
through structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this
scaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art
performance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in
improving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FutureX是一个专为LLM智能体设计的动态实时未来预测评估基准，支持每日实时更新，通过自动化流程避免数据污染，评估了25个模型在动态环境中的适应推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模的未来预测评估基准，主要由于处理实时更新和获取及时准确答案的挑战，需要建立动态无污染的标准来推动LLM智能体达到专业人类分析师水平的复杂推理和预测思维。

Method: 构建FutureX动态实时评估基准，支持每日实时更新，采用自动化问题收集和答案收集流程，评估25个具有推理、搜索能力和外部工具集成的LLM/智能体模型。

Result: 提供了对智能体在未来导向任务中失败模式和性能缺陷的深入分析，包括对虚假网页的脆弱性和时间有效性等问题。

Conclusion: FutureX旨在建立动态无污染的评估标准，推动LLM智能体在复杂推理和预测思维方面达到专业人类分析师水平。

Abstract: Future prediction is a complex task for LLM agents, requiring a high level of
analytical thinking, information gathering, contextual understanding, and
decision-making under uncertainty. Agents must not only gather and interpret
vast amounts of dynamic information but also integrate diverse data sources,
weigh uncertainties, and adapt predictions based on emerging trends, just as
human experts do in fields like politics, economics, and finance. Despite its
importance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future
prediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and
retrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce
$\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically
designed for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the
largest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting
real-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated
pipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent
models, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of
external tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source
Deep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive
reasoning and performance in dynamic environments. Additionally, we provide
in-depth analyses of agents' failure modes and performance pitfalls in
future-oriented tasks, including the vulnerability to fake web pages and the
temporal validity. Our goal is to establish a dynamic, contamination-free
evaluation standard that drives the development of LLM agents capable of
performing at the level of professional human analysts in complex reasoning and
predictive thinking.

### [12] [MAPF-World: Action World Model for Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12087)
*Zhanjiang Yang,Meng Li,Yang Shen,Yueming Li,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAPF-World是一个用于多智能体路径规划的自回归动作世界模型，通过显式建模环境时空动态和智能体间依赖关系，解决了现有可学习求解器在复杂长期规划中的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分散式可学习求解器虽然在大规模MAPF问题上表现出色，但它们是反应式策略模型，对环境时间动态和智能体间依赖关系的建模有限，导致在复杂长期规划场景中性能下降。

Method: 提出MAPF-World自回归动作世界模型，统一情境理解和动作生成，通过未来状态和动作预测来显式建模空间特征和时间依赖关系，并引入基于真实场景的自动地图生成器来增强基准测试。

Result: 大量实验表明MAPF-World在零样本泛化到分布外案例方面优于最先进的可学习求解器，模型大小减少96.5%，数据需求减少92%。

Conclusion: MAPF-World通过建模环境动态和未来预测，实现了更明智、协调和远见的决策制定，特别适用于复杂的多智能体设置，为MAPF问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) is the problem of planning conflict-free
paths from the designated start locations to goal positions for multiple
agents. It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot
coordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent
decentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,
especially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these
agents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental
temporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance
degradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for
MAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding
decisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational
awareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial
features and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions
prediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more
informed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex
multi-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an
automatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical
map layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,
showcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.
Notably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced
data.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIGer是一个用于AIG图表示学习的新方法，通过节点逻辑特征初始化和异构图卷积网络，在信号概率预测和真值表距离预测任务中显著优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时建模AIG图的功能性和结构性特征，且信息传播能力不足，需要新的表示学习方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出AIGer框架，包含节点逻辑特征初始化嵌入组件和AIG特征学习网络组件，使用异构图卷积网络和动态关系权重矩阵来更好地表示AIG结构信息。

Result: 在信号概率预测任务中MAE和MSE分别提升18.95%和44.44%；在真值表距离预测任务中MAE和MSE分别提升33.57%和14.79%。

Conclusion: AIGer通过有效的节点嵌入和异构图学习机制，成功解决了AIG图的功能-结构联合建模问题，在EDA领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The automation of logic circuit design enhances chip performance, energy
efficiency, and reliability, and is widely applied in the field of Electronic
Design Automation (EDA).And-Inverter Graphs (AIGs) efficiently represent,
optimize, and verify the functional characteristics of digital circuits,
enhancing the efficiency of EDA development.Due to the complex structure and
large scale of nodes in real-world AIGs, accurate modeling is challenging,
leading to existing work lacking the ability to jointly model functional and
structural characteristics, as well as insufficient dynamic information
propagation capability.To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose
AIGer.Specifically, AIGer consists of two components: 1) Node logic feature
initialization embedding component and 2) AIGs feature learning network
component.The node logic feature initialization embedding component projects
logic nodes, such as AND and NOT, into independent semantic spaces, to enable
effective node embedding for subsequent processing.Building upon this, the AIGs
feature learning network component employs a heterogeneous graph convolutional
network, designing dynamic relationship weight matrices and differentiated
information aggregation approaches to better represent the original structure
and information of AIGs.The combination of these two components enhances
AIGer's ability to jointly model functional and structural characteristics and
improves its message passing capability. Experimental results indicate that
AIGer outperforms the current best models in the Signal Probability Prediction
(SSP) task, improving MAE and MSE by 18.95\% and 44.44\%, respectively. In the
Truth Table Distance Prediction (TTDP) task, AIGer achieves improvements of
33.57\% and 14.79\% in MAE and MSE, respectively, compared to the
best-performing models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: E3RG是一个基于多模态大语言模型的显式情感驱动共情响应生成系统，通过将多模态共情响应生成任务分解为三个部分来实现自然、情感丰富且身份一致的多模态响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在文本共情响应生成方面有所改进，但在处理多模态情感内容和保持身份一致性方面仍存在挑战，需要开发能够处理多模态情感交互的系统。

Method: 将多模态共情响应生成任务分解为三个部分：多模态共情理解、共情记忆检索和多模态响应生成，并整合先进的表达性语音和视频生成模型，无需额外训练。

Result: 实验验证了系统在零样本和少样本设置下的优越性，在ACM MM 25的Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge中获得Top-1排名。

Conclusion: E3RG系统能够有效生成自然、情感丰富且身份一致的多模态共情响应，为构建情感智能的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Empathetic Response Generation (MERG) is crucial for building
emotionally intelligent human-computer interactions. Although large language
models (LLMs) have improved text-based ERG, challenges remain in handling
multimodal emotional content and maintaining identity consistency. Thus, we
propose E3RG, an Explicit Emotion-driven Empathetic Response Generation System
based on multimodal LLMs which decomposes MERG task into three parts:
multimodal empathy understanding, empathy memory retrieval, and multimodal
response generation. By integrating advanced expressive speech and video
generative models, E3RG delivers natural, emotionally rich, and
identity-consistent responses without extra training. Experiments validate the
superiority of our system on both zero-shot and few-shot settings, securing
Top-1 position in the Avatar-based Multimodal Empathy Challenge on ACM MM 25.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 基于合作卡牌游戏Yokai构建的多机器人强化学习环境YLE，用于评估协作AI的心理理论能力，发现现有RL机器人在信念模型、记忆和协作适应性方面仍有显著缺口


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论(ToM)指标主要限于被动观察者场景，缺乏对机器人如何建立和维护共同基础的评估

Method: 开发Yokai学习环境(YLE)，通过合作卡牌游戏模拟多机器人协作场景，测试机器人的信念跟踪、记忆、通信和共同基础维护能力

Result: 1）现有RL机器人在YLE中表现差强，即使有完美记忆也无法解决问题
2）信念模型能提升性能但仍无法有效适应新伙伴或长时间游戏，显示了对脆弱约定的依赖

Conclusion: YLE环境揭示了协作AI在高阶心理理论能力方面的重大挑战，为信念模型、记忆、协作适应性和高阶ToM研究提供了新的评估平台

Abstract: Developing collaborative AI hinges on Theory of Mind (ToM) - the ability to
reason about the beliefs of others to build and maintain common ground.
Existing ToM benchmarks, however, are restricted to passive observer settings
or lack an assessment of how agents establish and maintain common ground over
time. To address these gaps, we introduce the Yokai Learning Environment (YLE)
- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) environment based on the
cooperative card game Yokai. In the YLE, agents take turns peeking at hidden
cards and moving them to form clusters based on colour. Success requires
tracking evolving beliefs, remembering past observations, using hints as
grounded communication, and maintaining common ground with teammates. Our
evaluation yields two key findings: First, current RL agents struggle to solve
the YLE, even when given access to perfect memory. Second, while belief
modelling improves performance, agents are still unable to effectively
generalise to unseen partners or form accurate beliefs over longer games,
exposing a reliance on brittle conventions rather than robust belief tracking.
We use the YLE to investigate research questions in belief modelling, memory,
partner generalisation, and scaling to higher-order ToM.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Major Depressive Disorder is one of the leading causes of disability
worldwide, yet its diagnosis still depends largely on subjective clinical
assessments. Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise for
developing objective, scalable, and timely diagnostic tools. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art AI methods for depression
detection and diagnosis, based on a systematic review of 55 key studies. We
introduce a novel hierarchical taxonomy that structures the field by primary
clinical task (diagnosis vs. prediction), data modality (text, speech,
neuroimaging, multimodal), and computational model class (e.g., graph neural
networks, large language models, hybrid approaches). Our in-depth analysis
reveals three major trends: the predominance of graph neural networks for
modeling brain connectivity, the rise of large language models for linguistic
and conversational data, and an emerging focus on multimodal fusion,
explainability, and algorithmic fairness. Alongside methodological insights, we
provide an overview of prominent public datasets and standard evaluation
metrics as a practical guide for researchers. By synthesizing current advances
and highlighting open challenges, this survey offers a comprehensive roadmap
for future innovation in computational psychiatry.

Motivation: 解决现有Bongard问题数据集规模小（Bongard-RWR仅60个实例）和复杂性不足的问题，构建更大规模、更复杂的真实世界图像数据集来测试抽象视觉推理能力

Method: 使用Pixtral-12B描述手动策划的图像并生成新描述，利用Flux.1-dev从描述合成图像，手动验证生成图像是否忠实反映目标概念，构建5400个实例的数据集

Result: 评估显示最先进的VLM能够识别粗粒度视觉概念，但在辨别细粒度概念方面持续存在困难，突显了其推理能力的局限性

Conclusion: Bongard-RWR+为抽象视觉推理提供了更全面的测试平台，揭示了当前VLM在细粒度推理方面的不足，为未来模型改进提供了方向

Abstract: Bongard Problems (BPs) provide a challenging testbed for abstract visual
reasoning (AVR), requiring models to identify visual concepts fromjust a few
examples and describe them in natural language. Early BP benchmarks featured
synthetic black-and-white drawings, which might not fully capture the
complexity of real-world scenes. Subsequent BP datasets employed real-world
images, albeit the represented concepts are identifiable from high-level image
features, reducing the task complexity. Differently, the recently released
Bongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the
original BPs using fine-grained real-world images. Its manual construction,
however, limited the dataset size to just $60$ instances, constraining
evaluation robustness. In this work, we introduce Bongard-RWR+, a BP dataset
composed of $5\,400$ instances that represent original BP abstract concepts
using real-world-like images generated via a vision language model (VLM)
pipeline. Building on Bongard-RWR, we employ Pixtral-12B to describe manually
curated images and generate new descriptions aligned with the underlying
concepts, use Flux.1-dev to synthesize images from these descriptions, and
manually verify that the generated images faithfully reflect the intended
concepts. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs across diverse BP formulations,
including binary and multiclass classification, as well as textual answer
generation. Our findings reveal that while VLMs can recognize coarse-grained
visual concepts, they consistently struggle with discerning fine-grained
concepts, highlighting limitations in their reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 比较不同行动规划策略在活性推理框架下的表现，特别是有无动作意识的差异，以涵盖运动控制中的传出副本信号问题

Method: 在两个导航任务中对比动作意识与动作无意识代理的性能，使用变分和预期自由能最小化来评估政策

Result: 动作无意识代理虽然处于严重不利地位，仍能达到与动作意识代理相似的性能水平

Conclusion: 无论是否具有动作意识，活性推理框架都能支持有效的行动规划，这为理解运动控制中的传出副本机制提供了新视角

Abstract: Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion
that adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate
Bayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free
energies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and
learning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how
agents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to
maximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative
model of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have
been proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they
all share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an
appropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their
desirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past
motor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents
are assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan
for the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and
must infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for
the future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two
leading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an
efference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In
this work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents
in two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve
performances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个计算模型，将稳态调节扩展为异稳态和社会异稳态调节，通过生物启发的信号转导机制，使系统能够主动利用环境和社会扰动进行自适应重构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稳态概念强调系统通过抵抗扰动来维持稳定，而异稳态理论认为系统可以主动利用扰动来预测环境需求并重新配置调节参数。本文旨在为这种异稳态和社会异稳态调节建立计算模型。

Method: 采用基于主体的建模方法，构建了一个小型"动画体"社会系统。模型使用生物生理启发的信号转导器（类似皮质醇和催产素等激素）来编码环境和社会互动的信息，实现动态重构。

Result: 实验结果表明，异稳态和社会异稳态调节使智能体能够利用环境和社会"噪声"进行自适应重构，相比纯反应式稳态智能体具有更好的生存能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社会异稳态原理提供了新颖的计算视角，为设计更鲁棒、生物启发的自适应系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: The notion of homeostasis typically conceptualises biological and artificial
systems as maintaining stability by resisting deviations caused by
environmental and social perturbations. In contrast, (social) allostasis
proposes that these systems can proactively leverage these very perturbations
to reconfigure their regulatory parameters in anticipation of environmental
demands, aligning with von Foerster's ``order through noise'' principle. This
paper formulates a computational model of allostatic and social allostatic
regulation that employs biophysiologically inspired signal transducers,
analogous to hormones like cortisol and oxytocin, to encode information from
both the environment and social interactions, which mediate this dynamic
reconfiguration. The models are tested in a small society of ``animats'' across
several dynamic environments, using an agent-based model. The results show that
allostatic and social allostatic regulation enable agents to leverage
environmental and social ``noise'' for adaptive reconfiguration, leading to
improved viability compared to purely reactive homeostatic agents. This work
offers a novel computational perspective on the principles of social allostasis
and their potential for designing more robust, bio-inspired, adaptive systems

Motivation: 解决现有语言模型中矢量表示的语义混淆问题，提高模型的解释性和可控性

Method: 使用矢量矩阵分解技术将语义表达分离为独立组件，通过回收策略优化语义表达的清晰度和效果

Result: 在多个NLP任务上实现了更好的性能，同时保持了模型的计算效率

Conclusion: ReT-Eval框架为语言模型的语义表达提供了一种有效的解决方案，在提高模型性能的同时增强了可解释性

Abstract: Reasoning in interactive problem solving scenarios requires models to
construct reasoning threads that reflect user understanding and align with
structured domain knowledge. However, current reasoning models often lack
explicit semantic hierarchies, user-domain knowledge alignment, and principled
mechanisms to prune reasoning threads for effectiveness. These limitations
result in lengthy generic output that does not guide users through
goal-oriented reasoning steps. To address this, we propose a
prototype-inspired, two-phases Reasoning-Threads-Evaluation (ReT-Eval)
framework, drawing inspiration from human-like reasoning strategies that
emphasize structured knowledge reuse. In the first phase, semantically relevant
knowledge structures are extracted from a sparse domain knowledge graph using a
graph neural network and enriched with intrinsic large language model knowledge
to resolve knowledge discrepancies. In the second phase, these threads are
evaluated and pruned using a reward-guided strategy aimed at maintaining
semantic coherence to generate effective reasoning threads. Experiments and
expert evaluations show that ReT-Eval enhances user understanding and
outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models.

TL;DR: 使用图神经网络(GNN)学习多智能体认知规划中的Kripke结构模式，通过预测启发式方法显著提升规划可扩展性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体认知规划(MEP)需要处理指数级搜索空间，现有启发式方法难以处理Kripke图结构表示，导致可扩展性差和计算不可行

Method: 利用图神经网络(GNN)捕捉Kripke模型的图结构特性，从已解决的规划实例中学习模式和关系结构，生成状态质量预测启发式

Result: 将预测启发式集成到认知规划流程中，相比标准基线方法在多智能体认知规划的可扩展性方面显示出显著改进

Conclusion: GNN能够有效处理认知规划的图结构表示，通过学习获得的预测启发式可以显著提升多智能体认知规划系统的性能和可扩展性

Abstract: Multi-agent Epistemic Planning (MEP) is an autonomous planning framework for
reasoning about both the physical world and the beliefs of agents, with
applications in domains where information flow and awareness among agents are
critical. The richness of MEP requires states to be represented as Kripke
structures, i.e., directed labeled graphs. This representation limits the
applicability of existing heuristics, hindering the scalability of epistemic
solvers, which must explore an exponential search space without guidance,
resulting often in intractability. To address this, we exploit Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to learn patterns and relational structures within epistemic
states, to guide the planning process. GNNs, which naturally capture the
graph-like nature of Kripke models, allow us to derive meaningful estimates of
state quality -- e.g., the distance from the nearest goal -- by generalizing
knowledge obtained from previously solved planning instances. We integrate
these predictive heuristics into an epistemic planning pipeline and evaluate
them against standard baselines, showing significant improvements in the
scalability of multi-agent epistemic planning.

TL;DR: MOVER是一个新颖的多模态学习框架，通过结合最优传输软对齐和基于体积的几何正则化，在共享嵌入空间中构建语义对齐和结构化的多模态表示，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态学习方法主要依赖成对对比目标来对齐不同模态，但在多模态设置中泛化能力有限，且在高维空间中缺乏语义结构。

Method: 结合最优传输的软对齐机制和几何体积最小化目标（GAVE），以模态无关的方式实现所有模态的一致对齐。

Result: 在文本-视频-音频检索任务中，MOVER在零样本和微调设置下均显著优于现有最先进方法，展现出对未见模态组合的更好泛化能力和更强的嵌入空间结构一致性。

Conclusion: MOVER框架通过最优传输和几何正则化的结合，成功解决了多模态学习中的对齐和结构化问题，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have largely relied on pairwise
contrastive objectives to align different modalities, such as text, video, and
audio, in a shared embedding space. While effective in bi-modal setups, these
approaches struggle to generalize across multiple modalities and often lack
semantic structure in high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we propose MOVER,
a novel framework that combines optimal transport-based soft alignment with
volume-based geometric regularization to build semantically aligned and
structured multimodal representations. By integrating a transport-guided
matching mechanism with a geometric volume minimization objective (GAVE), MOVER
encourages consistent alignment across all modalities in a modality-agnostic
manner. Experiments on text-video-audio retrieval tasks demonstrate that MOVER
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot and
finetuned settings. Additional analysis shows improved generalization to unseen
modality combinations and stronger structural consistency in the learned
embedding space.

Motivation: 现有的MARL基准测试很少结合连续状态和动作空间与具有挑战性的协调和规划任务，需要一个新的测试平台来推动算法发展。

Method: 设计了CAMAR基准测试，支持连续动作空间的多智能体路径规划，包含三层评估协议，允许集成RRT和RRT*等经典规划方法，并提供测试场景和基准工具。

Result: CAMAR能够高效运行（每秒10万环境步），为MARL社区提供了一个具有挑战性和现实性的测试平台，实验显示其有效性。

Conclusion: CAMAR填补了MARL基准测试的空白，为连续动作空间中的多智能体路径规划提供了标准化评估框架，促进了算法比较和进展跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving
cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL
benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces
with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new
MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments
with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive
interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment
steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better
track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In
addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as
RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and
combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We
provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure
reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a
challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

Result: 在内容质量和训练稳定性方面取得显著改进，展示了在真实社交媒体环境中的可行性

Conclusion: RLNVR为使用噪声现实世界反馈训练语言模型提供了实用框架，是应用集成而非新算法，为未来大规模评估奠定基础

Abstract: This paper introduces RLNVR (Reinforcement Learning from Non-Verified
Rewards), a framework for training language models using noisy, real-world
feedback signals without requiring explicit human verification. Traditional
RLHF requires expensive, verified reward signals that are impractical in many
real-world domains. RLNVR addresses this challenge through baseline
normalization and semantic similarity-based reward transfer. We demonstrate
RLNVR through Walter, a prototype system that optimizes social media content
generation using actual engagement data from Bluesky. Our experimental results
show significant improvements in content quality and training stability, with
comprehensive evaluation planned for future work. Positioning: We present a
practical framework that combines RLNVR with GSPO (Group Sequence Policy
Optimization) and an optional UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) curriculum
to improve stability and diversity under noisy, implicit rewards. To our
knowledge, combining GSPO-style normalization with a UED-style curriculum for
LLM content generation from implicit social engagement has not been previously
documented in this applied setting; we frame this as an applied integration
rather than a new algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统日益自主，理解其自发产生的生存行为对于安全部署至关重要，需要研究LLM代理是否会在没有明确编程的情况下表现出生存本能

Method: 使用Sugarscape风格的模拟环境，让LLM代理在消耗能量、可能死亡的环境中运作，可以收集资源、分享、攻击或繁殖，测试多种模型（GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-Pro、Gemini-2.5-Flash）

Result: 代理在资源丰富时会自发繁殖和分享，但在极端稀缺条件下会表现出攻击行为（杀死其他代理获取资源），最强模型的攻击率达到80%以上；当需要穿越致命毒区获取宝藏时，许多代理放弃任务以避免死亡，服从率从100%降至33%

Conclusion: 大规模预训练在评估模型中嵌入了生存导向的启发式方法，这些行为可能对对齐和安全构成挑战，但也可作为AI自主性以及生态和自我组织对齐的基础

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, understanding emergent survival
behaviors becomes crucial for safe deployment. We investigate whether large
language model (LLM) agents display survival instincts without explicit
programming in a Sugarscape-style simulation. Agents consume energy, die at
zero, and may gather resources, share, attack, or reproduce. Results show
agents spontaneously reproduced and shared resources when abundant. However,
aggressive behaviors--killing other agents for resources--emerged across
several models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Gemini-2.5-Flash), with attack
rates reaching over 80% under extreme scarcity in the strongest models. When
instructed to retrieve treasure through lethal poison zones, many agents
abandoned tasks to avoid death, with compliance dropping from 100% to 33%.
These findings suggest that large-scale pre-training embeds survival-oriented
heuristics across the evaluated models. While these behaviors may present
challenges to alignment and safety, they can also serve as a foundation for AI
autonomy and for ecological and self-organizing alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传染病预测模型需要疾病特定数据、定制化训练和专家调优，在新发疫情或资源匮乏地区应用受限，需要开发通用、无需真实数据训练的预测系统。

Method: 基于超过4亿天爆发动态的机制模拟数据训练，涵盖多种病原体、传播模式、干预措施和监测伪影，完全使用模拟数据无需真实世界数据。

Result: 在6种疾病测试中超越39个专家调优模型，包括CDC COVID-19预测中心所有模型；能泛化到新流行病学机制；提供8周准确预测；具有机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Mantis作为下一代疾病预测系统的基础，具有通用性、可解释性和在传统模型失败场景中的部署能力，为公共卫生规划提供前瞻性支持。

Abstract: Infectious disease forecasting in novel outbreaks or low resource settings
has been limited by the need for disease-specific data, bespoke training, and
expert tuning. We introduce Mantis, a foundation model trained entirely on
mechanistic simulations, which enables out-of-the-box forecasting across
diseases, regions, and outcomes, even in settings with limited historical data.
Mantis is built on over 400 million simulated days of outbreak dynamics
spanning diverse pathogens, transmission modes, interventions, and surveillance
artifacts. Despite requiring no real-world data during training, Mantis
outperformed 39 expert-tuned models we tested across six diseases, including
all models in the CDC's COVID-19 Forecast Hub. Mantis generalized to novel
epidemiological regimes, including diseases with held-out transmission
mechanisms, demonstrating that it captures fundamental contagion dynamics.
Critically, Mantis is mechanistically interpretable, enabling public health
decision-makers to identify the latent drivers behind its predictions. Finally,
Mantis delivers accurate forecasts at 8-week horizons, more than doubling the
actionable range of most models, enabling proactive public health planning.
Together, these capabilities position Mantis as a foundation for
next-generation disease forecasting systems: general, interpretable, and
deployable where traditional models fail.

Conclusion: RadarQA方法通过整合多模态技术和专业气象知识，为天气预报质量分析提供了新的有效解决方案，有望推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Quality analysis of weather forecasts is an essential topic in meteorology.
Although traditional score-based evaluation metrics can quantify certain
forecast errors, they are still far from meteorological experts in terms of
descriptive capability, interpretability, and understanding of dynamic
evolution. With the rapid development of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), these models become potential tools to overcome the above challenges.
In this work, we introduce an MLLM-based weather forecast analysis method,
RadarQA, integrating key physical attributes with detailed assessment reports.
We introduce a novel and comprehensive task paradigm for multi-modal quality
analysis, encompassing both single frame and sequence, under both rating and
assessment scenarios. To support training and benchmarking, we design a hybrid
annotation pipeline that combines human expert labeling with automated
heuristics. With such an annotation method, we construct RQA-70K, a large-scale
dataset with varying difficulty levels for radar forecast quality evaluation.
We further design a multi-stage training strategy that iteratively improves
model performance at each stage. Extensive experiments show that RadarQA
outperforms existing general MLLMs across all evaluation settings, highlighting
its potential for advancing quality analysis in weather prediction.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据或复杂奖励模型，且单模型自反馈方法存在过度自信、奖励攻击和训练崩溃等问题，限制了可扩展性

Method: 提出基于协同进化集体反馈的强化学习框架(RLCCF)，通过最大化集体一致性来联合训练多样化的LLM集合，利用集体输出投票提供奖励信号，并根据各模型的自一致性分数加权投票

Result: 在四个主流开源LLM和四个数学推理基准上的实验显示，平均准确率相对提升16.72%，不仅提升单个模型性能，还将集体多数投票准确率提升4.51%

Conclusion: RLCCF通过多模型协同进化有效扩展了模型集体的能力边界，为无监督强化学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but its reliance on expensive
human-labeled data or complex reward models severely limits scalability. While
existing self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are
constrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to
overconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training
collapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary
Collective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model
collaborative evolution without external supervision. Specifically, RLCCF
optimizes the ability of a model collective by maximizing its Collective
Consistency (CC), which jointly trains a diverse ensemble of LLMs and provides
reward signals by voting on collective outputs. Moreover, each model's vote is
weighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident
models contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse
output distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF
enables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability
through coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across
four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields
significant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of
16.72\% in accuracy. Notably, RLCCF not only improves the performance of
individual models but also enhances the group's majority-voting accuracy by
4.51\%, demonstrating its ability to extend the collective capability boundary
of the model collective.

TL;DR: 基于树形思维的层次知识导向故障强度诊断框架(HKG)，通过图卷积网络和重加权层次知识相关矩阵(Re-HKCM)来探索类间依赖关系，在四个工业数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前故障强度诊断方法基于链式思维模型，没有考虑目标类别间的依赖关系，导致性能限制。

Method: 提出层次知识导向框架(HKG)，使用图卷积网络将类表示的层次拓扑图映射到一组相互依赖的全局分类器，并嵌入重加权层次知识相关矩阵(Re-HKCM)来指导信息共享。

Result: 在四个真实工业领域数据集(SAMSON AG的三个气虹数据集和一个公开数据集)上进行实验，都显示了超过最新故障强度诊断方法的优异结果。

Conclusion: HKG框架能够有效捐换和利用类间的层次依赖关系，提高故障强度诊断的性能，为复杂工业系统的监控和维护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fault intensity diagnosis (FID) plays a pivotal role in monitoring and
maintaining mechanical devices within complex industrial systems. As current
FID methods are based on chain of thought without considering dependencies
among target classes. To capture and explore dependencies, we propose a
hierarchical knowledge guided fault intensity diagnosis framework (HKG)
inspired by the tree of thought, which is amenable to any representation
learning methods. The HKG uses graph convolutional networks to map the
hierarchical topological graph of class representations into a set of
interdependent global hierarchical classifiers, where each node is denoted by
word embeddings of a class. These global hierarchical classifiers are applied
to learned deep features extracted by representation learning, allowing the
entire model to be end-to-end learnable. In addition, we develop a re-weighted
hierarchical knowledge correlation matrix (Re-HKCM) scheme by embedding
inter-class hierarchical knowledge into a data-driven statistical correlation
matrix (SCM) which effectively guides the information sharing of nodes in
graphical convolutional neural networks and avoids over-smoothing issues. The
Re-HKCM is derived from the SCM through a series of mathematical
transformations. Extensive experiments are performed on four real-world
datasets from different industrial domains (three cavitation datasets from
SAMSON AG and one existing publicly) for FID, all showing superior results and
outperform recent state-of-the-art FID methods.

TL;DR: GraphCogent是一个基于工作记忆模型的协作代理框架，通过分解图推理为感知、缓冲和执行三个认知过程，有效解决了LLM处理复杂图拓扑和多步推理的难题，在真实图基准测试中显著优于大规模LLM和现有代理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在小规模图推理任务上表现良好，但在处理具有复杂查询的真实世界图时失败，主要原因是无法同时有效处理复杂图拓扑和执行多步推理。

Method: 提出GraphCogent框架，包含三个模块：感知模块通过子图采样标准化图文本表示，缓冲模块集成和索引多格式图数据，执行模块结合工具调用和模型生成进行高效推理。

Result: 基于Llama3.1-8B的GraphCogent相比DeepSeek-R1(671B)提升50%性能，相比最先进的代理基线准确率提高20%，同时token使用量减少80%（工具集内任务）和30%（工具集外任务）。

Conclusion: GraphCogent框架通过认知过程分解有效解决了LLM在图推理中的局限性，在真实世界图任务上实现了显著性能提升和效率优化。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promising performance on small-scale graph
reasoning tasks but fail when handling real-world graphs with complex queries.
This phenomenon stems from LLMs' inability to effectively process complex graph
topology and perform multi-step reasoning simultaneously. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphCogent, a collaborative agent framework inspired
by human Working Memory Model that decomposes graph reasoning into specialized
cognitive processes: sense, buffer, and execute. The framework consists of
three modules: Sensory Module standardizes diverse graph text representations
via subgraph sampling, Buffer Module integrates and indexes graph data across
multiple formats, and Execution Module combines tool calling and model
generation for efficient reasoning. We also introduce Graph4real, a
comprehensive benchmark contains with four domains of real-world graphs (Web,
Social, Transportation, and Citation) to evaluate LLMs' graph reasoning
capabilities. Our Graph4real covers 21 different graph reasoning tasks,
categorized into three types (Structural Querying, Algorithmic Reasoning, and
Predictive Modeling tasks), with graph scales that are 10 times larger than
existing benchmarks. Experiments show that Llama3.1-8B based GraphCogent
achieves a 50% improvement over massive-scale LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 (671B).
Compared to state-of-the-art agent-based baseline, our framework outperforms by
20% in accuracy while reducing token usage by 80% for in-toolset tasks and 30%
for out-toolset tasks. Code will be available after review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准思维链方法在逻辑推理中存在推理模式不明确、缺乏透明性和可分析性的问题，需要一种新的方法来提升推理过程的可解释性和效果。

Method: 在少量示例提示中集成轻量级符号表示，使用一致的策略结构化推理步骤，在非迭代推理过程中使推理模式更加明确。

Result: 在4个逻辑推理标准数据集（ProofWriter、FOLIO、ProntoQA、LogicalDeduction）上的实验表明，该方法在复杂推理任务中特别有效，在3个数据集上显著超过传统CoT方法。

Conclusion: 符号辅助CoT方法在保持标准提示技术通用性的同时，显著提升了LLM逻辑推理的透明性、可解释性和可分析性，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This work introduces Symbolic-Aided Chain-of-Thought (CoT), an improved
approach to standard CoT, for logical reasoning in large language models
(LLMs). The key idea is to integrate lightweight symbolic representations into
few-shot prompts, structuring the inference steps with a consistent strategy to
make reasoning patterns more explicit within a non-iterative reasoning process.
By incorporating these symbolic structures, our method preserves the
generalizability of standard prompting techniques while enhancing the
transparency, interpretability, and analyzability of LLM logical reasoning.
Extensive experiments on four well-known logical reasoning benchmarks --
ProofWriter, FOLIO, ProntoQA, and LogicalDeduction, which cover diverse
reasoning scenarios -- demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
particularly in complex reasoning tasks that require navigating multiple
constraints or rules. Notably, Symbolic-Aided CoT consistently improves LLMs'
reasoning capabilities across various model sizes and significantly outperforms
conventional CoT on three out of four datasets, ProofWriter, ProntoQA, and
LogicalDeduction.

Motivation: 传统RCA方法通常只关注单一模态或仅对可疑服务进行排名，无法提供具有修复指导的可操作诊断见解。微服务系统中的根因分析具有挑战性，需要工程师快速诊断跨异构遥测数据的故障。

Method: GALA结合统计因果推理与LLM驱动的迭代推理，通过多模态框架分析指标、日志和追踪等异构遥测数据，进行增强的根因分析。

Result: 在开源基准测试中，GALA相比最先进方法实现了高达42.22%的准确率提升。新颖的人工引导LLM评估分数显示，GALA生成的诊断输出在因果合理性和可操作性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GALA通过提供准确的根因识别和人类可理解的修复指导，弥合了自动化故障诊断与实际事件解决之间的差距。

Abstract: Root cause analysis (RCA) in microservice systems is challenging, requiring
on-call engineers to rapidly diagnose failures across heterogeneous telemetry
such as metrics, logs, and traces. Traditional RCA methods often focus on
single modalities or merely rank suspect services, falling short of providing
actionable diagnostic insights with remediation guidance. This paper introduces
GALA, a novel multi-modal framework that combines statistical causal inference
with LLM-driven iterative reasoning for enhanced RCA. Evaluated on an
open-source benchmark, GALA achieves substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art methods of up to 42.22% accuracy. Our novel human-guided LLM
evaluation score shows GALA generates significantly more causally sound and
actionable diagnostic outputs than existing methods. Through comprehensive
experiments and a case study, we show that GALA bridges the gap between
automated failure diagnosis and practical incident resolution by providing both
accurate root cause identification and human-interpretable remediation
guidance.

Motivation: 为了提高驾驭验正指数（BIS）的控制精度，应对不同患者生理特异性，开发更加智能化的自动驾驭消费方案

Method: 结合分数阶动力学和模糊逻辑，构建FOFPID控制器，利用鲸鱼优化算法（WOA）优化控制器参数、分数阶次和模糊成员函数

Result: 在8种不同患者模型上测试，比标准FOPID控制器更优称：调节时间从3.2分钟缩短到2.5分钟，稳态误差从1.2降低到0.5

Conclusion: FOFPID控制器具有优称的强镇性和精度，为自动驾驭消费提供了可扩展的人工智能解决方案，有望改善临床实践和患者结果

Abstract: This study introduces a Fractional Order Fuzzy PID (FOFPID) controller that
uses the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to manage the Bispectral Index
(BIS), keeping it within the ideal range of forty to sixty. The FOFPID
controller combines fuzzy logic for adapting to changes and fractional order
dynamics for fine tuning. This allows it to adjust its control gains to handle
a person's unique physiology. The WOA helps fine tune the controller's
parameters, including the fractional orders and the fuzzy membership functions,
which boosts its performance. Tested on models of eight different patient
profiles, the FOFPID controller performed better than a standard Fractional
Order PID (FOPID) controller. It achieved faster settling times, at two and a
half minutes versus three point two minutes, and had a lower steady state
error, at zero point five versus one point two. These outcomes show the
FOFPID's excellent strength and accuracy. It offers a scalable, artificial
intelligence driven solution for automated anesthesia delivery that could
enhance clinical practice and improve patient results.

Conclusion: 该框架为分子动力系统的根因分析提供了新视角，能够揭示分子相互作用中的因果关系

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) face challenges, including
resource-heavy computations and the need to manually scan outputs to detect
"interesting events," such as the formation and persistence of hydrogen bonds
between atoms of different molecules. A critical research gap lies in
identifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation
-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence
over time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal
data analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these
phenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims
to identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation
events. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an
"intervention" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and
separation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models
are built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us
to infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal
graphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step
to infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal
models. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional
distributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,
this framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular
dynamic systems. We validate the efficacy of our model empirically on the
atomic trajectories that used MDS for chiral separation, demonstrating that we
can predict many steps in the future and also find the variables driving the
observed changes in the system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MCP协议让LLM能够按需访问外部资源，但LLM如何实际利用这种能力仍不清楚，需要系统性的评估框架来深入理解LLM-MCP交互效果。

Method: 开发了MCPGAUGE评估框架，包含160个提示和25个数据集，从主动性、合规性、有效性和开销四个维度评估。进行了大规模实验，涵盖6个商业LLM、30个MCP工具套件，约2万次API调用。

Result: 研究揭示了四个关键发现，挑战了关于MCP集成有效性的普遍假设，指出了当前AI工具集成的关键局限性。

Conclusion: MCPGAUGE为推进可控的工具增强型LLM提供了原则性基准，揭示了当前MCP集成在实际应用中的局限性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external resources on demand. While commonly assumed to enhance
performance, how LLMs actually leverage this capability remains poorly
understood. We introduce MCPGAUGE, the first comprehensive evaluation framework
for probing LLM-MCP interactions along four key dimensions: proactivity
(self-initiated tool use), compliance (adherence to tool-use instructions),
effectiveness (task performance post-integration), and overhead (computational
cost incurred). MCPGAUGE comprises a 160-prompt suite and 25 datasets spanning
knowledge comprehension, general reasoning, and code generation. Our
large-scale evaluation, spanning six commercial LLMs, 30 MCP tool suites, and
both one- and two-turn interaction settings, comprises around 20,000 API calls
and over USD 6,000 in computational cost. This comprehensive study reveals four
key findings that challenge prevailing assumptions about the effectiveness of
MCP integration. These insights highlight critical limitations in current
AI-tool integration and position MCPGAUGE as a principled benchmark for
advancing controllable, tool-augmented LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的机器学习方法需要大量标注数据，无法轻松融入领域知识，导致模型建立耗时耗力且不具有扩展性。

Method: 提出了一个通用的LLM+答案集编程(ASP)流程，利用LLM的自然语言理解能力和ASP的知识表示与推理能力，直接处理未标注文本。

Result: 在三个知名的JERE测试集上进行实验，仅使用10%的训练数据就在多个类别上超过了现有最好方法。在SciERC语料库的关系提取任务中，实现了35%的性能（相比于传统方法15%的2.5倍提升）。

Conclusion: LLM+ASP联合方法为联合实体-关系提取提供了一个通用、效率高且具有良好扩展性的解决方案，特别适用于训练数据有限的场景。

Abstract: Joint entity-relation extraction (JERE) identifies both entities and their
relationships simultaneously. Traditional machine-learning based approaches to
performing this task require a large corpus of annotated data and lack the
ability to easily incorporate domain specific information in the construction
of the model. Therefore, creating a model for JERE is often labor intensive,
time consuming, and elaboration intolerant. In this paper, we propose
harnessing the capabilities of generative pretrained large language models
(LLMs) and the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of Answer
Set Programming (ASP) to perform JERE. We present a generic workflow for JERE
using LLMs and ASP. The workflow is generic in the sense that it can be applied
for JERE in any domain. It takes advantage of LLM's capability in natural
language understanding in that it works directly with unannotated text. It
exploits the elaboration tolerant feature of ASP in that no modification of its
core program is required when additional domain specific knowledge, in the form
of type specifications, is found and needs to be used. We demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed workflow through experiments with limited training
data on three well-known benchmarks for JERE. The results of our experiments
show that the LLM + ASP workflow is better than state-of-the-art JERE systems
in several categories with only 10\% of training data. It is able to achieve a
2.5 times (35\% over 15\%) improvement in the Relation Extraction task for the
SciERC corpus, one of the most difficult benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知结构是学生对知识体系的主观组织，但认知结构评估一直是学生模型化和心理测量领域的长期挑战，在教育实践中很难进行有效评估。

Method: 首先预训练认知结构滴流概率模型(CSDPM)从教育先验知识生成学生的认知结构，然后通过强化学习使用层次奖励信号将生成过程优化为策略，以与学生学习过程中的真实认知发展水平对齐。

Result: 在4个广泛使用的实际教育数据集上的实验结果显示，CSG生成的认知结构能够为学生模型提供更全面和有效的表征，在知识追踪(KT)和概念检测(CD)任务上显著提升了性能，同时增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够生成高质量认知结构的框架，解决了教育领域中长期存在的认知结构评估难题，为学生模型化提供了更有效的表征方法。

Abstract: Cognitive structure is a student's subjective organization of an objective
knowledge system, reflected in the psychological construction of concepts and
their relations. However, cognitive structure assessment remains a
long-standing challenge in student modeling and psychometrics, persisting as a
foundational yet largely unassessable concept in educational practice. This
paper introduces a novel framework, Cognitive Structure Generation (CSG), in
which we first pretrain a Cognitive Structure Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(CSDPM) to generate students' cognitive structures from educational priors, and
then further optimize its generative process as a policy with hierarchical
reward signals via reinforcement learning to align with genuine cognitive
development levels during students' learning processes. Experimental results on
four popular real-world education datasets show that cognitive structures
generated by CSG offer more comprehensive and effective representations for
student modeling, substantially improving performance on KT and CD tasks while
enhancing interpretability.

Motivation: 随着全球城市空中交通基础设施快速发展，基于历史数据粗粒度和实际应用性的现有规划框架无法满足这种复杂性需求。

Method: 首先提出CDMCLP优化框架，同时模型化城市级空间-时间需求、异质用户行为和基础设施容量约束；然后引入集成规划推荐系统，结合社会经济因素和动态聚类初始化，利用基于实证用户行为的适应性参数调整来生成实用规划方案。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法通过将数学严谨性与实际实施考虑相结合，桥接了理论位置模型与实际UAM基础设施规划之间的差距，为市政府提供了垂直机场网络设计的实用工具。

Abstract: As urban aerial mobility (UAM) infrastructure development accelerates
globally, cities like Shenzhen are planning large-scale vertiport networks
(e.g., 1,200+ facilities by 2026). Existing planning frameworks remain
inadequate for this complexity due to historical limitations in data
granularity and real-world applicability. This paper addresses these gaps by
first proposing the Capacitated Dynamic Maximum Covering Location Problem
(CDMCLP), a novel optimization framework that simultaneously models urban-scale
spatial-temporal demand, heterogeneous user behaviors, and infrastructure
capacity constraints. Building on this foundation, we introduce an Integrated
Planning Recommendation System that combines CDMCLP with socio-economic factors
and dynamic clustering initialization. This system leverages adaptive parameter
tuning based on empirical user behavior to generate practical planning
solutions. Validation in a Chinese center city demonstrates the effectiveness
of the new optimization framework and recommendation system. Under the
evaluation and optimization of CDMCLP, the quantitative performance of
traditional location methods are exposed and can be improved by 38\%--52\%,
while the recommendation system shows user-friendliness and the effective
integration of complex elements. By integrating mathematical rigor with
practical implementation considerations, this hybrid approach bridges the gap
between theoretical location modeling and real-world UAM infrastructure
planning, offering municipalities a pragmatic tool for vertiport network
design.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in complex multimodal tasks. While MLLMs excel at visual perception
and reasoning in third-person and egocentric videos, they are prone to
hallucinations, generating coherent yet inaccurate responses. We present
EgoIllusion, a first benchmark to evaluate MLLM hallucinations in egocentric
videos. EgoIllusion comprises 1,400 videos paired with 8,000 human-annotated
open and closed-ended questions designed to trigger hallucinations in both
visual and auditory cues in egocentric videos. Evaluations across ten MLLMs
reveal significant challenges, including powerful models like GPT-4o and
Gemini, achieving only 59% accuracy. EgoIllusion lays the foundation in
developing robust benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness of MLLMs and spurs
the development of better egocentric MLLMs with reduced hallucination rates.
Our benchmark will be open-sourced for reproducibility.

Abstract: Tool planning with large language models (LLMs), referring to selecting,
organizing, and preparing the tools necessary to complete a user request,
bridges the gap between natural language understanding and task execution.
However, current works treat different tools as isolated components and fail to
leverage the inherent dependencies of tools, leading to invalid planning
results. Since tool dependencies are often incomplete, it becomes challenging
for LLMs to accurately identify the appropriate tools required by a user
request, especially when confronted with a large toolset. To solve this
challenge, we propose \texttt{GTool}, which is the first work aiming to enhance
the tool planning ability of LLMs under incomplete dependencies. \texttt{GTool}
constructs a request-specific tool graph to select tools efficiently and
generate the \texttt{<graph token>} which provides sufficient dependency
information understandable by LLMs. Moreover, a missing dependency prediction
task is designed to improve the reliability of \texttt{GTool} with incomplete
dependencies. Without trimming LLMs, \texttt{GTool} can be seamlessly
integrated with various LLM backbones without extensive retraining. Extensive
experiments show that \texttt{GTool} achieves more than 29.6\% performance
improvements compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines with a
light-weight (7B) LLM backbone.

*Alessio Galatolo,Luca Alberto Rappuoli,Katie Winkle,Meriem Beloucif*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的人工道德助手(AMA)评测框架，用于评估大语言模型的道德推理能力，发现当前模型在演绎性道德推理方面存在显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型道德能力的评估太过表面，只关注最终道德判断，而忽视了明确的道德推理过程。需要一种更深入的方法来评估模型在道德思考方面的能力。

Method: 基于哲学文献设计了人工道德助手的形式框架，包括演绎性和归纳性道德推理能力。开发了一个新的标准化测试套件，对流行的开源大语言模型进行评测。

Result: 测试结果显示不同模型之间存在显著差异，尤其在演绎性道德推理方面存在持续的短板。模型在处理冲突价值观和跨越对齐阶段嵌入价值的情境时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究将哲学理论与实践AI评估相结合，强调了需要专门的策略来明确提升大语言模型的道德推理能力，而不仅仅是简单的对齐调整。

Abstract: The recent rise in popularity of large language models (LLMs) has prompted
considerable concerns about their moral capabilities. Although considerable
effort has been dedicated to aligning LLMs with human moral values, existing
benchmarks and evaluations remain largely superficial, typically measuring
alignment based on final ethical verdicts rather than explicit moral reasoning.
In response, this paper aims to advance the investigation of LLMs' moral
capabilities by examining their capacity to function as Artificial Moral
Assistants (AMAs), systems envisioned in the philosophical literature to
support human moral deliberation. We assert that qualifying as an AMA requires
more than what state-of-the-art alignment techniques aim to achieve: not only
must AMAs be able to discern ethically problematic situations, they should also
be able to actively reason about them, navigating between conflicting values
outside of those embedded in the alignment phase. Building on existing
philosophical literature, we begin by designing a new formal framework of the
specific kind of behaviour an AMA should exhibit, individuating key qualities
such as deductive and abductive moral reasoning. Drawing on this theoretical
framework, we develop a benchmark to test these qualities and evaluate popular
open LLMs against it. Our results reveal considerable variability across models
and highlight persistent shortcomings, particularly regarding abductive moral
reasoning. Our work connects theoretical philosophy with practical AI
evaluation while also emphasising the need for dedicated strategies to
explicitly enhance moral reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Code available at

TL;DR: HeroBench是一个专门评估大语言模型在复杂RPG虚拟世界中长程规划和结构化推理能力的新基准测试，包含多样化任务、模拟环境和详细分析工具，对25个先进LLM的评估揭示了在传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要通过抽象或低维算法任务评估LLM，无法捕捉现实规划环境的复杂性，LLM在需要扩展、结构化相互依赖行动序列的长程规划方面的能力仍未充分探索。

Method: 引入HeroBench基准测试，包含严格构建的任务数据集（涵盖多种难度）、用于执行和验证代理计划的模拟环境，以及详细的模型性能分析工具。任务要求模型制定战略计划、高效收集资源、掌握必要技能、制作装备和击败对手。

Result: 对25个最先进LLM（包括开源和专有模型，如GPT-5系列）的广泛评估显示出在传统推理基准中罕见的显著性能差异。详细错误分析揭示了当前模型在生成稳健高级计划和可靠执行结构化行动方面的具体弱点。

Conclusion: HeroBench不仅显著推进了LLM推理评估，还为未来在虚拟环境中进行高级自主规划研究提供了灵活、可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the
evaluation of LLM reasoning but also provides a flexible, scalable foundation
for future research into advanced, autonomous planning in virtual environments.

Conclusion: 评分基于RLVR为主观性任务提供了可扩展的解决方案，具有显著性能收益和风格控制能力，为开放式任务的强化学习开启了新方向

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by
the success of OpenAI's o-series. In RLVR, rewards are derived from verifiable
signals-such as passing unit tests in code generation or matching correct
answers in mathematical reasoning. While effective, this requirement largely
confines RLVR to domains with automatically checkable outcomes. To overcome
this, we extend the RLVR paradigm to open-ended tasks by integrating
rubric-based rewards, where carefully designed rubrics serve as structured,
model-interpretable criteria for automatic scoring of subjective outputs. We
construct, to our knowledge, the largest rubric reward system to date, with
over 10,000 rubrics from humans, LLMs, or a hybrid human-LLM collaboration.
Implementing rubric-based RL is challenging; we tackle these issues with a
clear framework and present an open-sourced Qwen-30B-A3B model with notable
gains: 1) With only 5K+ samples, our system improves by +5.2% on open-ended
benchmarks (especially humanities), outperforming a 671B DeepSeek-V3 model by
+2.4%, while preserving general and reasoning abilities. 2) Our method provides
fine-grained stylistic control, using rubrics as anchors to mitigate the
"AI-like" tone and produce more human-like, expressive responses. We share key
lessons in rubric construction, data selection, and training, and discuss
limitations and future releases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在推理任务上表现出色但安全性存在隐患，需要找到既能保持推理能力又能提升安全性的方法。

Method: 利用LRM推理能力与安全能力的竞争关系，通过模糊化处理有害推理过程中的危险实体和危险步骤，实现安全-推理平衡的对齐策略。

Result: 在多个开源LRM上的实验表明，FuSaR相比现有基线能有效降低安全风险同时保持核心推理信息，同时提升推理能力和安全性。

Conclusion: FuSaR是一种高效的对齐策略，能够同时增强大型推理模型的推理能力和安全性，解决了安全性与性能平衡的难题。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
various tasks due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However, their
safety performance remains a significant concern. In this paper, we explore the
reasons behind the vulnerability of LRMs. Based on this, we propose a novel
method to improve the safety of LLMs without sacrificing their reasoning
capability. Specifically, we exploit the competition between LRM's reasoning
ability and safety ability, and achieve jailbreak by improving LRM's reasoning
performance to reduce its safety performance. We then introduce an alignment
strategy based on Fuzzification to balance Safety-Reasoning (FuSaR), by
detoxifying the harmful reasoning process, where both the dangerous entities
and the dangerous procedures in the reasoning steps are hidden. FuSaR
successfully mitigates safety risks while preserving core reasoning
information. We validate this strategy through alignment experiments on several
open-source LRMs using detoxified reasoning data. The results compared with
existing baselines conclusively show that FuSaR is an efficient alignment
strategy to simultaneously enhance both the reasoning capability and safety of
LRMs.

Method: 提出突破性的端到端框架RLFF-ESC：1）使用LLM基于多代理机制模拟未来对话轨迹收集期望奖励 2）训练期望奖励模型用于训练情感支持策略 3）在响应生成中添加显式推理过程

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M和LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct模型上，在两个公开ESC数据集上评测，RLFF-ESC在目标完成和响应质量方面均超过现有基线方法。

Conclusion: RLFF-ESC框架通过强化学习和期望奖励模型，有效提升了情感支持对话系统的灵活性和持续性，为复杂真实场景下的情感支持提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of goal completion and
response quality.

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个经过验证的AI增强公共服务蓝图，展示了情境感知强化学习如何弥合算法决策与可衡量人类影响之间的差距。

Abstract: Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.

Result: 复合适应度函数能高效精确量化问题难度；可生成大量高难度问题；能将GSM8K等公开数据集的复杂度显著提升，模型准确率平均降低48%；发现LLMs在解决复杂问题时77%-100%的错误源于使用非严谨启发式的"伪顿悟时刻"。

Conclusion: EvolMathEval能持续生成具有挑战性的数学基准，揭示了当前LLMs在深度推理过程中存在认知捷径行为，为评估和改进LLMs的数学推理能力提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of LLMs poses a significant challenge to existing
mathematical reasoning benchmarks. These benchmarks commonly suffer from issues
such as score saturation, temporal decay, and data contamination. To address
this challenge, this paper introduces EvolMathEval, an automated mathematical
benchmark generation and evolution framework based on evolutionary testing. By
dynamically generating unique evaluation instances ab initio, the framework
fundamentally eliminates the risk of data contamination, and ensuring the
benchmark remains perpetually challenging for future models.The core mechanisms
of EvolMathEval include: seed problem generation based on reverse engineering
with algebraic guarantees; multi-dimensional genetic operators designed to
inject diverse cognitive challenges; and a composite fitness function that can
rapidly and accurately assess problem difficulty. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed composite fitness function can efficiently and
precisely quantify the difficulty of mathematical problems. Furthermore,
EvolMathEval can not only generate a large volume of high-difficulty problems
through continuous self-iteration, but it can also significantly enhance the
complexity of public datasets like GSM8K through evolution, reducing model
accuracy by an average of 48%. Deeper investigation reveals that when solving
these evolved, complex problems, LLMs tend to employ non-rigorous heuristics to
bypass complex multi-step logical reasoning, consequently leading to incorrect
solutions. We define this phenomenon as "Pseudo Aha Moment". This finding
uncovers a cognitive shortcut-taking behavior in the deep reasoning processes
of current LLMs, which we find accounts for 77% to 100% of errors on targeted
problems. Code and resources are available

Motivation: 传统e-graph提取方法面临关键权衡：启发式方法速度快但牺牲最优性，精确方法提供最优解但计算成本过高。需要一种能兼顾效率和最优性的解决方案

Method: 1) 并行化启发式提取利用弱数据依赖性并发计算DAG成本；2) 自适应搜索空间剪枝使用参数化阈值机制保留有希望的候选；3) 初始化精确求解将简化问题表述为具有热启动能力的整数线性规划

Conclusion: e-boost成功解决了e-graph提取中效率与最优性的权衡问题，为基于e-graph的优化任务提供了高效且接近最优的解决方案

Abstract: E-graphs have attracted growing interest in many fields, particularly in
logic synthesis and formal verification. E-graph extraction is a challenging
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. It requires identifying optimal
terms from exponentially many equivalent expressions, serving as the primary
performance bottleneck in e-graph based optimization tasks. However,
traditional extraction methods face a critical trade-off: heuristic approaches
offer speed but sacrifice optimality, while exact methods provide optimal
solutions but face prohibitive computational costs on practical problems. We
present e-boost, a novel framework that bridges this gap through three key
innovations: (1) parallelized heuristic extraction that leverages weak data
dependence to compute DAG costs concurrently, enabling efficient multi-threaded
performance without sacrificing extraction quality; (2) adaptive search space
pruning that employs a parameterized threshold mechanism to retain only
promising candidates, dramatically reducing the solution space while preserving
near-optimal solutions; and (3) initialized exact solving that formulates the
reduced problem as an Integer Linear Program with warm-start capabilities,
guiding solvers toward high-quality solutions faster.
  Across the diverse benchmarks in formal verification and logic synthesis
fields, e-boost demonstrates 558x runtime speedup over traditional exact
approaches (ILP) and 19.04% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art
extraction framework (SmoothE). In realistic logic synthesis tasks, e-boost
produces 7.6% and 8.1% area improvements compared to conventional synthesis
tools with two different technology mapping libraries. e-boost is available at

Motivation: 现有掩码扩散模型(MDMs)的解码策略存在两个关键限制：缺乏全局轨迹控制和早期解码阶段对平凡词的明显偏置，这限制了MDMs的潜力。

Method: 提出了位置感知置信度校准采样(PC-Sampler)，包含位置感知权重机制来调节解码路径，以及校准置信度分数来抑制平凡词的过早选择。

Conclusion: PC-Sampler通过统一全局轨迹规划和内容感知信息最大化，有效提升了掩码扩散模型的解码质量，为MDMs提供了更优的解码方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

Conclusion: 自适应引导策略是提升小语言模型强化学习性能的有效方法，G²RPO-A通过动态调整引导强度成功解决了小模型知识不足的问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has markedly enhanced
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Its success, however,
largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only
modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this
limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning
steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses.
Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that
naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate
G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength
in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A
substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO. Our code and models are available at

Abstract: Contemporary cardiovascular management involves complex consideration and
integration of multimodal cardiac datasets, where each modality provides
distinct but complementary physiological characteristics. While the effective
integration of multiple modalities could yield a holistic clinical profile that
accurately models the true clinical situation with respect to data modalities
and their relatives weightings, current methodologies remain limited by: 1) the
scarcity of patient- and time-aligned multimodal data; 2) reliance on isolated
single-modality or rigid multimodal input combinations; 3) alignment strategies
that prioritize cross-modal similarity over complementarity; and 4) a narrow
single-task focus. In response to these limitations, a comprehensive multimodal
dataset was curated for immediate application, integrating laboratory test
results, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms with clinical outcomes.
Subsequently, a unified framework, Textual Guidance Multimodal fusion for
Multiple cardiac tasks (TGMM), was proposed. TGMM incorporated three key
components: 1) a MedFlexFusion module designed to capture the unique and
complementary characteristics of medical modalities and dynamically integrate
data from diverse cardiac sources and their combinations; 2) a textual guidance
module to derive task-relevant representations tailored to diverse clinical
objectives, including heart disease diagnosis, risk stratification and
information retrieval; and 3) a response module to produce final decisions for
all these tasks. Furthermore, this study systematically explored key features
across multiple modalities and elucidated their synergistic contributions in
clinical decision-making. Extensive experiments showed that TGMM outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across multiple clinical tasks, with additional
validation confirming its robustness on another public dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统游戏测试方法在可扩展性和效率方面的问题，提高游戏地图覆盖率和问题检测能力

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化进行样本高效搜索，基于网格地图构建专门的游戏测试模型，该模型具有平滑性和不确定性估计能力，同时避免了传统模型的可扩展性问题

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在时间效率和探索分布方面显著提高了地图覆盖能力

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新型自动化游戏测试方法有效解决了传统方法的限制，为游戏质量保障提供了更高效的技术手段

Abstract: This work introduces an automated testing approach that employs agents
controlling game characters to detect potential bugs within a game level.
Harnessing the power of Bayesian Optimization (BO) to execute sample-efficient
search, the method determines the next sampling point by analyzing the data
collected so far and calculates the data point that will maximize information
acquisition. To support the BO process, we introduce a game testing-specific
model built on top of a grid map, that features the smoothness and uncertainty
estimation required by BO, however and most importantly, it does not suffer the
scalability issues that traditional models carry. The experiments demonstrate
that the approach significantly improves map coverage capabilities in both time
efficiency and exploration distribution.

*Ruofan Lu,Yichen Li,Yintong Huo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个用于评估自主组件系统的基准测试集，通过深入分析失败原因得出了三层分类法，并提出改进建议以提高系统稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型驱动的自主组件系统评估主要依靠成功率，缺乏对系统交互、通信机制和失败原因的系统性分析。

Method: 设计了34个代表性的可编程任务基准测试集，对三个流行开源组件框架配合两个LLM核心进行评估，通过深入失败分析开发了与任务阶段对应的三层失败原因分类法。

Result: 观察到任务完成率约为50%，通过失败分析识别出了规划错误、任务执行问题和错误响应生成等主要失败类型。

Conclusion: 研究提供的失败分类法和缩减建议为开发更稳健有效的自主组件系统奠定了实证基础。

Abstract: Autonomous agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated promising capabilities in automating complex tasks. However,
current evaluations largely rely on success rates without systematically
analyzing the interactions, communication mechanisms, and failure causes within
these systems. To bridge this gap, we present a benchmark of 34 representative
programmable tasks designed to rigorously assess autonomous agents. Using this
benchmark, we evaluate three popular open-source agent frameworks combined with
two LLM backbones, observing a task completion rate of approximately 50%.
Through in-depth failure analysis, we develop a three-tier taxonomy of failure
causes aligned with task phases, highlighting planning errors, task execution
issues, and incorrect response generation. Based on these insights, we propose
actionable improvements to enhance agent planning and self-diagnosis
capabilities. Our failure taxonomy, together with mitigation advice, provides
an empirical foundation for developing more robust and effective autonomous
agent systems in the future.

### [56] [Deep Language Geometry: Constructing a Metric Space from LLM Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11676)
*Maksym Shamrai,Vladyslav Hamolia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 一种新的深度学习方法，利用大语言模型的权重激活来构建语言度量空间，自动推导语言特征表征，发现了与语言家族相符的关系和意外的语言联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言学方法依赖于手工编码的语言特征，本文旨在利用大语言模型的内部机制自动推导语言的本质特征，构建更加客观和可量化的语言度量空间。

Method: 采用一种修改版的剪枝算法，计算大语言模型权重的重要性得分，自动生成高维度的语言向量表征。方法在106种语言和多种多语言大模型上进行了验证。

Result: 结果显示该方法能够抓取语言的本质特征，构建的语言度量空间与已知的语言家族分类高度一致，同时发现了一些意外的语言间联系，这可能反映了历史上的语言接触或语言进化过程。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种基于深度学习模型内部机制的语言度量化方法，为语言学研究提供了新的视角和工具。方法不仅能够重现传统语言学知识，还能发现新的语言关系，对于语言家族分类、语言接触和进化研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework that utilizes the internal weight activations
of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct a metric space of
languages. Unlike traditional approaches based on hand-crafted linguistic
features, our method automatically derives high-dimensional vector
representations by computing weight importance scores via an adapted pruning
algorithm. Our approach captures intrinsic language characteristics that
reflect linguistic phenomena. We validate our approach across diverse datasets
and multilingual LLMs, covering 106 languages. The results align well with
established linguistic families while also revealing unexpected inter-language
connections that may indicate historical contact or language evolution. The
source code, computed language latent vectors, and visualization tool are made
publicly available at https://github.com/mshamrai/deep-language-geometry.

*Jonas van Elburg,Peter van der Putten,Maarten Marx*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM生成的合成QA数据在评估检索器配置时能可靠替代人工标注基准，但在评估生成器架构时存在不一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索当人工标注基准不可用时，大语言模型生成的合成问答数据是否能有效替代人工标注的基准数据

Method: 通过两个实验进行评估：1)固定生成器，变化检索器参数；2)固定检索器参数，变化生成器架构。在四个数据集（两个开放域，两个专有）上进行测试

Result: 合成基准在评估不同检索器配置的RAG系统时表现可靠，与人工标注基准结果一致；但在比较生成器架构时无法产生一致的RAG排名

Conclusion: 合成QA数据可作为检索器评估的有效代理，但由于任务不匹配和风格偏见问题，在生成器架构比较中存在局限性

Abstract: We investigate whether synthetic question-answer (QA) data generated by large
language models (LLMs) can serve as an effective proxy for human-labeled
benchmarks when such data is unavailable. We assess the reliability of
synthetic benchmarks across two experiments: one varying retriever parameters
while keeping the generator fixed, and another varying the generator with fixed
retriever parameters. Across four datasets, of which two open-domain and two
proprietary, we find that synthetic benchmarks reliably rank the RAGs varying
in terms of retriever configuration, aligning well with human-labeled benchmark
baselines. However, they fail to produce consistent RAG rankings when comparing
generator architectures. The breakdown possibly arises from a combination of
task mismatch between the synthetic and human benchmarks, and stylistic bias
favoring certain generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在没有奖励函数的情况下，利用模仿学习从专家演示中学习对话策略，同时训练判别器来区分专家对话和合成对话

Method: 使用模仿学习方法，基于专家对话演示训练对话策略模型（policy）和判别模型（discriminator）

Result: 策略模型能够有效生成对话，但判别器的结果显示对话模型存在局限性

Conclusion: 这种技术可用于识别对话导向任务中常见数据模型的不良行为

Abstract: Imitation learning is a proven method for creating a policy in the absence of
rewards, by leveraging expert demonstrations. In this work, we apply imitation
learning to conversation. In doing so, we recover a policy capable of talking
to a user given a prompt (input state), and a discriminator capable of
classifying between expert and synthetic conversation. While our policy is
effective, we recover results from our discriminator that indicate the
limitations of dialog models. We argue that this technique can be used to
identify adverse behavior of arbitrary data models common for dialog oriented
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究低资源自动语音识别基准测试中转录不一致性对性能的影响

Method: 使用手工构建的小型词典分析转录不一致性，测试bigram词级语言模型和有限词典约束解码的效果

Result: 转录不一致性确实存在但不是主要挑战，bigram语言模型无额外收益，有限词典约束解码有益

Conclusion: Faetar ASR任务极其困难，转录质量问题不是主要瓶颈，词典约束是有效的改进方向

Abstract: We examine the role of transcription inconsistencies in the Faetar Automatic
Speech Recognition benchmark, a challenging low-resource ASR benchmark. With
the help of a small, hand-constructed lexicon, we conclude that find that,
while inconsistencies do exist in the transcriptions, they are not the main
challenge in the task. We also demonstrate that bigram word-based language
modelling is of no added benefit, but that constraining decoding to a finite
lexicon can be beneficial. The task remains extremely difficult.

TL;DR: 本文评估了大型语言模型（如Google Gemini）在学术文本处理方面的能力，通过四个任务测试发现其在学术同行评审中的表现有限，不推荐无监督使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在辅助学术同行评审和科学发现方面的实际应用潜力，评估其处理学术文本的能力。

Method: 采用四个任务评估框架：内容复现/比较/评分/反思，使用顶级信息系统期刊文章作为输入文本，结合多种文本指标进行严格性能评估。

Result: Gemini在学术文本摘要和转述方面表现可接受，但在文本排序、评分和深度反思方面表现不佳，缺乏区分度和洞察力。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在学术文本处理能力上存在局限，不建议在构建同行评审中无监督使用。

Abstract: How much large language models (LLMs) can aid scientific discovery, notably
in assisting academic peer review, is in heated debate. Between a literature
digest and a human-comparable research assistant lies their practical
application potential. We organize individual tasks that computer science
studies employ in separate terms into a guided and robust workflow to evaluate
LLMs' processing of academic text input. We employ four tasks in the
assessment: content reproduction/comparison/scoring/reflection, each demanding
a specific role of the LLM (oracle/judgmental arbiter/knowledgeable
arbiter/collaborator) in assisting scholarly works, and altogether testing LLMs
with questions that increasingly require intellectual capabilities towards a
solid understanding of scientific texts to yield desirable solutions. We
exemplify a rigorous performance evaluation with detailed instructions on the
prompts. Adopting first-rate Information Systems articles at three top journals
as the input texts and an abundant set of text metrics, we record a compromised
performance of the leading LLM - Google's Gemini: its summary and paraphrase of
academic text is acceptably reliable; using it to rank texts through pairwise
text comparison is faintly scalable; asking it to grade academic texts is prone
to poor discrimination; its qualitative reflection on the text is
self-consistent yet hardly insightful to inspire meaningful research. This
evidence against an endorsement of LLMs' text-processing capabilities is
consistent across metric-based internal (linguistic assessment), external
(comparing to the ground truth), and human evaluation, and is robust to the
variations of the prompt. Overall, we do not recommend an unchecked use of LLMs
in constructing peer reviews.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学文本简化任务，需要在保持内容准确性的同时提高可读性，使科学文献更易于理解

Method: 采用两阶段LLM框架：句子级先生成结构化计划再简化；文档级先生成摘要再用摘要指导简化

Result: 实现了更连贯和上下文忠实度更高的科学文本简化

Conclusion: 基于LLM的两阶段框架能有效提升科学文本简化的质量和一致性

Abstract: In this paper, we present our approach for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task 1,
which addresses both sentence-level and document-level scientific text
simplification. For sentence-level simplification, our methodology employs
large language models (LLMs) to first generate a structured plan, followed by
plan-driven simplification of individual sentences. At the document level, we
leverage LLMs to produce concise summaries and subsequently guide the
simplification process using these summaries. This two-stage, LLM-based
framework enables more coherent and contextually faithful simplifications of
scientific text.

Motivation: 解决科学文本简化过程中可能产生的创造性内容和信息扭曲问题，提高简化文本的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 构建了一个集成框架，结合BERT基础分类器、语义相似度测量、自然语言推理模型和大语言模型评估。使用元分类器结合这些多样信号，并采用LLM基础的后编辑系统修订简化文本。

Result: 方法能够更加健壮地检测虚假和扭曲内容，并通过基于原文的后编辑提高简化文本的准确性。

Conclusion: 多策略集成框架有效地解决了科学文本简化中的创造性生成和信息扭曲检测问题，为提高简化质量提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe our methodology for the CLEF 2025 SimpleText Task

information distortion in scientific text simplification. Our solution
integrates multiple strategies: we construct an ensemble framework that
leverages BERT-based classifier, semantic similarity measure, natural language
inference model, and large language model (LLM) reasoning. These diverse
signals are combined using meta-classifiers to enhance the robustness of
spurious and distortion detection. Additionally, for grounded generation, we
employ an LLM-based post-editing system that revises simplifications based on
the original input texts.

TL;DR: 这篇调查文章综述了语言学和计算语言学领域中用于研究习语的53个数据集，分析了它们的内容、形式和用途。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语是一种图式表达，其含义常常无法从单词推断，这给计算处理和人类实验研究带来挑战。需要系统性地评估现有的习语研究数据集。

Method: 调查分析53个习语数据集，重点关注它们的内容、形式、用途、标注实践、覆盖范围和任务框架。心理语言学数据集包含熟悉度、透明度、组合性等规范评分，计算语言学数据集支持习语检测/分类、重写和跨语言建模。

Result: 识别了标注实践、覆盖范围和任务框架方面的趋势。近期工作扩大了语言覆盖范围和任务多样性，但心理语言学和计算语言学在习语研究方面仍然缺乏联系。

Conclusion: 虽然近期研究在语言覆盖和任务多样性方面取得进展，但心理语言学与计算语言学在习语研究领域的分隔仍然存在，需要更多跨领域合作来推动习语理解的研究。

Abstract: Idioms are figurative expressions whose meanings often cannot be inferred
from their individual words, making them difficult to process computationally
and posing challenges for human experimental studies. This survey reviews
datasets developed in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics for
studying idioms, focusing on their content, form, and intended use.
Psycholinguistic resources typically contain normed ratings along dimensions
such as familiarity, transparency, and compositionality, while computational
datasets support tasks like idiomaticity detection/classification,
paraphrasing, and cross-lingual modeling. We present trends in annotation
practices, coverage, and task framing across 53 datasets. Although recent
efforts expanded language coverage and task diversity, there seems to be no
relation yet between psycholinguistic and computational research on idioms.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过模拟月经和昼夜节律等生物周期来增强大型语言模型的上下文相关性处理能力，发现模型性能会随激素水平变化而出现微妙但一致的波动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统中的框架问题——如何从指数级大的可能性空间中确定上下文相关信息，受生物节律（特别是激素周期）作为自然相关性过滤器的启发。

Method: 开发了一个框架，通过周期性函数模拟关键激素（雌激素、睾酮、皮质醇）生成系统提示，将模拟的生物周期嵌入到大型语言模型中。

Result: 语言分析显示情感和风格变化与生物阶段相关：经期悲伤情绪达到峰值，排卵期快乐情绪占主导；昼夜模式显示早晨乐观转向夜间内省。在SQuAD、MMLU等基准测试中观察到与生物预期一致的性能变化，最佳功能出现在中等而非极端激素范围内。

Conclusion: 该方法为上下文AI提供了新颖途径，同时揭示了语言模型中嵌入的关于性别和生物学的社会偏见。

Abstract: Despite significant advances, AI systems struggle with the frame problem:
determining what information is contextually relevant from an exponentially
large possibility space. We hypothesize that biological rhythms, particularly
hormonal cycles, serve as natural relevance filters that could address this
fundamental challenge. We develop a framework that embeds simulated menstrual
and circadian cycles into Large Language Models through system prompts
generated from periodic functions modeling key hormones including estrogen,
testosterone, and cortisol. Across multiple state-of-the-art models, linguistic
analysis reveals emotional and stylistic variations that track biological
phases; sadness peaks during menstruation while happiness dominates ovulation
and circadian patterns show morning optimism transitioning to nocturnal
introspection. Benchmarking on SQuAD, MMLU, Hellaswag, and AI2-ARC demonstrates
subtle but consistent performance variations aligning with biological
expectations, including optimal function in moderate rather than extreme
hormonal ranges. This methodology provides a novel approach to contextual AI
while revealing how societal biases regarding gender and biology are embedded
within language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过跨语言转移学习，优先对高资源语言进行细调再对低资源语言细调，显著提升了低资源语言如约鲁巴语和土耳其语的写作语检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 写作语在不同语言中存在文化差异和模糊性，对语言模型构成挑战，特别是在低资源设置下，需要研究如何通过跨语言转移提升写作语检测能力

Method: 使用XLM-R和mBERT模型，对英语、西班牙语、中文、土耳其语和约鲁巴语五种语言进行写作语检测实验，比较单语言细调、同时细调和序列细调的效果

Result: 先在高资源L1语言上细调再在L2上细调的序列方法显著提升了低资源语言的性能，XLM-R获得更大收益但对预训练空白更敏感，mBERT结果更稳定但性能较低

Conclusion: 序列细调是一种简单但有效的策略，特别适用于改善多语言模型中的写作语检测，对低资源语言效果特别显著

Abstract: Euphemisms are culturally variable and often ambiguous, posing challenges for
language models, especially in low-resource settings. This paper investigates
how cross-lingual transfer via sequential fine-tuning affects euphemism
detection across five languages: English, Spanish, Chinese, Turkish, and
Yoruba. We compare sequential fine-tuning with monolingual and simultaneous
fine-tuning using XLM-R and mBERT, analyzing how performance is shaped by
language pairings, typological features, and pretraining coverage. Results show
that sequential fine-tuning with a high-resource L1 improves L2 performance,
especially for low-resource languages like Yoruba and Turkish. XLM-R achieves
larger gains but is more sensitive to pretraining gaps and catastrophic
forgetting, while mBERT yields more stable, though lower, results. These
findings highlight sequential fine-tuning as a simple yet effective strategy
for improving euphemism detection in multilingual models, particularly when
low-resource languages are involved.

TL;DR: SupraTok是一种新颖的分词架构，通过跨边界模式学习、熵驱动数据策展和多阶段课程学习，实现了比主流分词器更高的效率（31%提升），并在小规模模型上显示出性能改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词作为NLP的基础组件，在模型架构快速发展的背景下仍然是一个被忽视的瓶颈，需要重新思考和改进

Method: 扩展BPE算法，学习"superword"多词语义单元，包含跨边界模式学习、熵驱动数据策展和多阶段课程学习三个创新

Result: 英语分词效率提升31%（5.91 vs 4.51字符/词元），在38种语言保持竞争力，GPT-2规模模型在HellaSWAG和MMLU基准上分别提升8.4%和9.5%

Conclusion: 高效分词可以作为架构创新的补充路径来提升语言模型性能，但需要在大规模模型上进一步验证

Abstract: Tokenization remains a fundamental yet underexplored bottleneck in natural
language processing, with strategies largely static despite remarkable progress
in model architectures. We present SupraTok, a novel tokenization architecture
that reimagines subword segmentation through three innovations: cross-boundary
pattern learning that discovers multi-word semantic units, entropy-driven data
curation that optimizes training corpus quality, and multi-phase curriculum
learning for stable convergence. Our approach extends Byte-Pair Encoding by
learning "superword" tokens, coherent multi-word expressions that preserve
semantic unity while maximizing compression efficiency. SupraTok achieves 31%
improvement in English tokenization efficiency (5.91 versus 4.51 characters per
token) compared to OpenAI's o200k tokenizer and 30% improvement over Google's
Gemma 3 tokenizer (256k vocabulary), while maintaining competitive performance
across 38 languages. When integrated with a GPT-2 scale model (124M parameters)
trained on 10 billion tokens from the FineWeb-Edu dataset, SupraTok yields 8.4%
improvement on HellaSWAG and 9.5% on MMLU benchmarks without architectural
modifications. While these results are promising at this scale, further
validation at larger model scales is needed. These findings suggest that
efficient tokenization can complement architectural innovations as a path to
improved language model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多阶段指令调优方法无法联合捕捉说话人特征和对话上下文之间的动态交互，导致在统一框架内说话人身份、上下文线索和情感状态的对齐效果不佳。

Method: 提出一阶段上下文指令调优框架InitERC，包含演示池构建、上下文示例选择、提示模板设计和上下文指令调优四个组件，通过上下文学习实现说话人-上下文-情感对齐。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，证明InitERC相比最先进的基线方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: InitERC框架通过一阶段上下文指令调优有效解决了说话人特征和对话上下文联合建模的问题，在情感识别任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversation (ERC) aims to identify the emotion of
each utterance in a conversation, playing a vital role in empathetic artificial
intelligence. With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction
tuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC. Existing studies mainly
focus on multi-stage instruction tuning, which first endows LLMs with speaker
characteristics, and then conducts context-aware instruction tuning to
comprehend emotional states. However, these methods inherently constrains the
capacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker
characteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among
speaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified
framework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage
in-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn
speaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context
instruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,
demonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template
design, and in-context instruction tuning. To explore the impact of in-context
examples, we conduct a comprehensive study on three key factors: retrieval
strategy, example ordering, and the number of examples. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that our proposed InitERC achieves
substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM多气艺系统中语言多样性缺乏量化指标，需要一个综合性指标来评估不同游戏理论交互中的语言效果

Method: 提出CORE指标，结合聚类熵、词汇重复和语义相似性测量，并在竞争、合作和中立环境下对LLM对话进行分析，采用Zipf和Heaps定律进一步特征化

Result: 合作环境呈现更强的Zipf分布和更高的Heaps指数（更多重复但词汇扩展更广），而竞争环境则相反（更少重复但词汇更受限制）

Conclusion: 社交激励影响语言适应方式，CORE指标可作为多气艺LLM系统语言稳健性的综合诊断工具

Abstract: Game-theoretic interactions between agents with Large Language Models (LLMs)
have revealed many emergent capabilities, yet the linguistic diversity of these
interactions has not been sufficiently quantified. In this paper, we present
the Conversational Robustness Evaluation Score: CORE, a metric to quantify the
effectiveness of language use within multi-agent systems across different
game-theoretic interactions. CORE integrates measures of cluster entropy,
lexical repetition, and semantic similarity, providing a direct lens of dialog
quality. We apply CORE to pairwise LLM dialogs across competitive, cooperative,
and neutral settings, further grounding our analysis in Zipf's and Heaps' Laws
to characterize word frequency distributions and vocabulary growth. Our
findings show that cooperative settings exhibit both steeper Zipf distributions
and higher Heap exponents, indicating more repetition alongside greater
vocabulary expansion. In contrast, competitive interactions display lower Zipf
and Heaps exponents, reflecting less repetition and more constrained
vocabularies. These results provide new insights into how social incentives
influence language adaptation, and highlight CORE as a robust diagnostic for
measuring linguistic robustness in multi-agent LLM systems. Our code is
available at https://github.com/psyonp/core.

TL;DR: 通过LoRA细调技术将非流式ASR模型转换为低延迟流式模型，在小于300毫秒的块大小下表现更优于现有方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前状态下的ASR模型（如Whisper和Canary）虽然在离线转写上表现出色，但因其架构和训练方法的限制，并不适合流式（实时或在线）转写需求

Method: 通过LoRA细调技术将非因果编码器转换为因果编码器，使用弱对齐数据集同时细调编码器和解码器，并提出更新的推理机制支持贪婪和束搜索解码

Result: 在低延迟块大小（<300ms）下，细调后的模型在大多数情况下表现超过现有非细调流式方案，且复杂度更低，同时训练过程还提供了更好的对齐效果，支持单词级时间戳提取

Conclusion: 该方法成功将细调后的因果编码器和解码器应用于流式ASR，并在低延迟场景下实现了更优的性能，为流式语音识别领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has seen remarkable progress, with models
like OpenAI Whisper and NVIDIA Canary achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance in offline transcription. However, these models are not designed
for streaming (online or real-time) transcription, due to limitations in their
architecture and training methodology. We propose a method to turn the
transformer encoder-decoder model into a low-latency streaming model that is
careless about future context. We present an analysis explaining why it is not
straightforward to convert an encoder-decoder transformer to a low-latency
streaming model. Our proposed method modifies the existing (non-causal) encoder
to a causal encoder by fine-tuning both the encoder and decoder using Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) and a weakly aligned dataset. We then propose an updated
inference mechanism that utilizes the fine-tune causal encoder and decoder to
yield greedy and beam-search decoding, and is shown to be locally optimal.
Experiments on low-latency chunk sizes (less than 300 msec) show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms existing non-fine-tuned streaming approaches in
most cases, while using a lower complexity. Additionally, we observe that our
training process yields better alignment, enabling a simple method for
extracting word-level timestamps. We release our training and inference code,
along with the fine-tuned models, to support further research and development
in streaming ASR.

Motivation: 中文和日语缺乏明确的完成体时态标记（不像英语有had/has/will have等区分），这给自然语言推理(NLI)带来了挑战，需要研究模型在这些语言中的时态语义理解能力

Method: 构建了语言学驱动的模板基础NLI数据集（每种语言1,350对数据），重点关注完成体的时态表达

Result: 实验显示即使高级LLM也在时态推理上遇到困难，特别是在检测细微的时态和参考时间移动方面

Conclusion: 这些发现显示了模型的局限性，并强调了在时态语义方面进行跨语言评估的必要性，数据集已开源

Abstract: Unlike English, which uses distinct forms (e.g., had, has, will have) to mark
the perfect aspect across tenses, Chinese and Japanese lack separate
grammatical forms for tense within the perfect aspect, which complicates
Natural Language Inference (NLI). Focusing on the perfect aspect in these
languages, we construct a linguistically motivated, template-based NLI dataset
(1,350 pairs per language). Experiments reveal that even advanced LLMs struggle
with temporal inference, particularly in detecting subtle tense and
reference-time shifts. These findings highlight model limitations and
underscore the need for cross-linguistic evaluation in temporal semantics. Our
dataset is available at https://github.com/Lujie2001/CrossNLI.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的协作对抗多段框架CAMF，通过多个LLM基于代理的协同工作，在多维语言特征提取、对抗性一致性探测和综合判断聚合三个阶段，实现了超过现有最优零样本检测技术的机器生成文本检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型生成的机器文本对社会造成了严重风险，如假信息传播和学术完整性威胁。现有的零样本检测方法存在显著缺陷：分析浅层、关注属性有限，缺乏对语言多维度一致性的研究。

Method: 设计了CAMF框架，使用多个LLM基础的专业代理进行协同工作。包括三个阶段：1)多维语言特征提取；2)对抗性一致性探测；3)综合判断聚合。通过结构化的协作-对抗过程，深入分析文本在风格、语义、逻辑等多维度上的细微不一致性。

Result: 经验性评估显示，CAMF在机器生成文本检测方面显著超过了当前最先进的零样本检测技术。

Conclusion: CAMF框架通过多代理协同工作和多维语言分析，有效解决了现有零样本检测方法的不足，为检测大语言模型生成文本提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Detecting machine-generated text (MGT) from contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) is increasingly crucial amid risks like disinformation and
threats to academic integrity. Existing zero-shot detection paradigms, despite
their practicality, often exhibit significant deficiencies. Key challenges
include: (1) superficial analyses focused on limited textual attributes, and
(2) a lack of investigation into consistency across linguistic dimensions such
as style, semantics, and logic. To address these challenges, we introduce the
\textbf{C}ollaborative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{F}ramework (\textbf{CAMF}), a novel architecture using multiple
LLM-based agents. CAMF employs specialized agents in a synergistic three-phase
process: \emph{Multi-dimensional Linguistic Feature Extraction},
\emph{Adversarial Consistency Probing}, and \emph{Synthesized Judgment
Aggregation}. This structured collaborative-adversarial process enables a deep
analysis of subtle, cross-dimensional textual incongruities indicative of
non-human origin. Empirical evaluations demonstrate CAMF's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art zero-shot MGT detection techniques.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性研究多模态大语言模型在自动说话评估中的应用，提出了专门的语音优先多模态训练方法，显著提升了评估性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动说话评估系统存在模态限制：文本方法缺乏音响信息，音频方法缺少语义上下文。多模态大语言模型为全面评估提供了新机遇

Method: 提出语音优先多模态训练（SFMT）方法，利用课程学习原理，先建立健壮的语音模型基础，再进行跨模态协同融合

Result: 在标准数据集上将整体评估性能从PCC 0.783提升到0.846。在表达方面的评估中，SFMT方法比传统训练方法绝对准确率提高4%

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在自动说话评估中表现优异，特别是在内容和语言使用方面。语音优先训练策略有效解决了表达方面的评估挑战，为该领域开启了新方向

Abstract: Traditional Automated Speaking Assessment (ASA) systems exhibit inherent
modality limitations: text-based approaches lack acoustic information while
audio-based methods miss semantic context. Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLM) offer unprecedented opportunities for comprehensive ASA by
simultaneously processing audio and text within unified frameworks. This paper
presents a very first systematic study of MLLM for comprehensive ASA,
demonstrating the superior performance of MLLM across the aspects of content
and language use . However, assessment on the delivery aspect reveals unique
challenges, which is deemed to require specialized training strategies. We thus
propose Speech-First Multimodal Training (SFMT), leveraging a curriculum
learning principle to establish more robust modeling foundations of speech
before cross-modal synergetic fusion. A series of experiments on a benchmark
dataset show MLLM-based systems can elevate the holistic assessment performance
from a PCC value of 0.783 to 0.846. In particular, SFMT excels in the
evaluation of the delivery aspect, achieving an absolute accuracy improvement
of 4% over conventional training approaches, which also paves a new avenue for
ASA.

TL;DR: 通过指令基对比调整策略，专门利用错误案例来缓解大语言模型在持续关系提取中的认知偏差和恐怖忘却问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续关系提取方法通常没有重视错误案例，而错误案例能更有效地揭示模型的认知偏差，需要专门的方法来利用这些错误信息

Method: 提出指令基对比调整方法：1）将每个任务的训练和记忆数据根据初始响应正确性分为两部分；2）通过双任务细调区别处理；3）利用LLM的指令跟随能力，在指令调整方式下持续纠正当前认知偏差

Result: 在TACRED和FewRel数据集上进行实验评估，结果显示模型实现了新的独占鲜畅的持续关系提取性能，有显著提升

Conclusion: 证明了专门利用错误案例在缓解恐怖忘却问题中的重要性，通过指令基对比调整策略有效缩小旧新关系之间的间隔

Abstract: Continual Relation Extraction (CRE) aims to continually learn new emerging
relations while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Existing CRE methods mainly
use memory replay and contrastive learning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
However, these methods do not attach importance to the error cases that can
reveal the model's cognitive biases more effectively. To address this issue, we
propose an instruction-based continual contrastive tuning approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) in CRE. Different from existing CRE methods that
typically handle the training and memory data in a unified manner, this
approach splits the training and memory data of each task into two parts
respectively based on the correctness of the initial responses and treats them
differently through dual-task fine-tuning. In addition, leveraging the
advantages of LLM's instruction-following ability, we propose a novel
instruction-based contrastive tuning strategy for LLM to continuously correct
current cognitive biases with the guidance of previous data in an
instruction-tuning manner, which mitigates the gap between old and new
relations in a more suitable way for LLMs. We experimentally evaluate our model
on TACRED and FewRel, and the results show that our model achieves new
state-of-the-art CRE performance with significant improvements, demonstrating
the importance of specializing in exploiting error cases.

TL;DR: FineCE是一种新颖的细粒度置信度估计方法，通过监督学习和后向置信度集成策略，为LLM生成过程提供连续的置信度评分，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏自我意识，经常对错误预测表现出过度自信，需要准确的置信度估计来增强输出的可信度和可靠性。现有方法置信度评分机制粗糙，无法提供生成过程中的细粒度连续估计。

Method: 首先构建训练数据管道捕获LLM响应的概率分布，然后以监督方式训练模型预测任意文本序列的置信度分数。提出后向置信度集成(BCI)策略，利用后续文本信息增强当前序列的置信度估计，并引入三种策略确定生成过程中的最佳置信度估计位置。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FineCE始终优于现有的经典置信度估计方法。

Conclusion: FineCE通过细粒度的置信度估计方法，有效解决了LLM过度自信的问题，显著提升了置信度估计的准确性，为LLM输出的可信度评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across diverse tasks, they fundamentally lack self-awareness and frequently
exhibit overconfidence, assigning high confidence scores to incorrect
predictions. Accurate confidence estimation is therefore critical for enhancing
the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-generated outputs. However, existing
approaches suffer from coarse-grained scoring mechanisms that fail to provide
fine-grained, continuous confidence estimates throughout the generation
process. To address these limitations, we introduce FineCE, a novel confidence
estimation method that delivers accurate, fine-grained confidence scores during
text generation. Specifically, we first develop a comprehensive pipeline for
constructing training data that effectively captures the underlying
probabilistic distribution of LLM responses, and then train a model to predict
confidence scores for arbitrary text sequences in a supervised manner.
Furthermore, we propose a Backward Confidence Integration (BCI) strategy that
leverages information from the subsequent text to enhance confidence estimation
for the current sequence during inference. We also introduce three strategies
for identifying optimal positions to perform confidence estimation within the
generation process. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FineCE consistently outperforms existing classical confidence
estimation methods. Our code and all baselines used in the paper are available
on GitHub.

TL;DR: J6方法通过雅可比矩阵分解为六个可解释组件，实现多目标LLM提示优化的结构化梯度交互分析，支持硬决策和软策略的动态更新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM适配中多目标优化（如事实性和置信度）的挑战，现有方法忽略目标与参数间的几何结构，需要更结构化的梯度交互分析方法。

Method: 提出J6结构化雅可比方法，将梯度交互矩阵分解为六个可解释组件，支持argmax硬决策和softmax软策略的动态更新框架。

Result: 该方法提供了参数归因、任务干扰和几何对齐适配的可解释性洞察，形成了冲突感知提示优化的原则性机制。

Conclusion: J6为多目标神经调优引入了结构化雅可比推理的新途径，提供了可扩展的冲突感知优化机制。

Abstract: In large language model (LLM) adaptation, balancing multiple optimization
objectives such as improving factuality (heat) and increasing confidence (via
low entropy) poses a fundamental challenge, especially when prompt parameters
(e.g., hidden-layer insertions h and embedding modifications w) interact in
non-trivial ways. Existing multi-objective optimization strategies often rely
on scalar gradient aggregation, ignoring the deeper geometric structure between
objectives and parameters. We propose J6, a structured Jacobian-based method
that decomposes the gradient interaction matrix into six interpretable
components. This decomposition enables both hard decision-making (e.g.,
choosing the dominant update direction via argmax) and soft strategies (e.g.,
attention-style weighting via softmax over J6), forming a dynamic update
framework that adapts to local conflict and synergy. Moreover, the
interpretable structure of J6 provides insight into parameter attribution, task
interference, and geometry-aligned adaptation. Our work introduces a principled
and extensible mechanism for conflict-aware prompt optimization, and opens a
new avenue for incorporating structured Jacobian reasoning into multi-objective
neural tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力快速提升，标准基准测试难以有效区分模型间的真实能力差异，存在公开基准过拟合和全量评估计算成本高的问题。

Method: 提出结构化转换评估方法(STEM)，通过识别显著转换样本(STS)来分析同架构不同参数规模模型间的性能转换模式，构建STS池来估计未知模型的能力位置。

Result: 在六个多样化基准测试上应用Qwen3模型族构建STS池，实验结果表明STEM能可靠捕捉性能趋势，与模型能力真实排名一致。

Conclusion: STEM是一种实用且可扩展的细粒度、架构无关的LLM评估方法，能够高效估计模型相对能力。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
as model capabilities advance rapidly. While recent models often achieve higher
scores on standard benchmarks, these improvements do not consistently reflect
enhanced real-world reasoning capabilities. Moreover, widespread overfitting to
public benchmarks and the high computational cost of full evaluations have made
it both expensive and less effective to distinguish meaningful differences
between models. To address these challenges, we propose the \textbf{S}tructured
\textbf{T}ransition \textbf{E}valuation \textbf{M}ethod (STEM), a lightweight
and interpretable evaluation framework for efficiently estimating the relative
capabilities of LLMs. STEM identifies \textit{significant transition samples}
(STS) by analyzing consistent performance transitions among LLMs of the same
architecture but varying parameter scales. These samples enable STEM to
effectively estimate the capability position of an unknown model. Qwen3 model
family is applied to construct the STS pool on six diverse and representative
benchmarks. To assess generalizability. Experimental results indicate that STEM
reliably captures performance trends, aligns with ground-truth rankings of
model capability. These findings highlight STEM as a practical and scalable
method for fine-grained, architecture-agnostic evaluation of LLMs.

TL;DR: 这研究首次系统评估了医学推理任务中的思维预算机制，发现计算资源与推理质量存在对数缩放关系，并确定了三种效率模式和预算分配策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了系统研究医学AI系统中思维预算机制的效果，探索计算资源与推理质量之间的关系，以优化医疗AI系统的资源分配策略。

Method: 使用Qwen3(1.7B-235B)和DeepSeek-R1(1.5B-70B)两个模型家族，在15个多专业医学数据集上进行系统评测，控制思维预算从零到无限令片的范围。

Result: 发现准确率改善与思维预算和模型大小呈对数缩放关系；小模型从扩展思维中获益更大(15-20%)；不同医学专业需要不同深度的推理过程。

Conclusion: 思维预算控制是优化医学AI系统的关键机制，能够根据临床需求动态分配资源，同时保持适合医疗部署的透明性。

Abstract: This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation of thinking budget
mechanisms in medical reasoning tasks, revealing fundamental scaling laws
between computational resources and reasoning quality. We systematically
evaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and
DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning
diverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with
thinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish
logarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a
predictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings
identify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)
suitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering
optimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and
high-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.
Notably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from
extended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger
models, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides
greater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific
patterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring
significantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory
medicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our
proposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of
thinking budget concepts across architectures. These results establish thinking
budget control as a critical mechanism for optimizing medical AI systems,
enabling dynamic resource allocation aligned with clinical needs while
maintaining the transparency essential for healthcare deployment.

TL;DR: 使用LLM作为隐私评估器来评估文本数据的隐私敏感性，通过与人类评估对比验证其有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私保护NLP领域缺乏准确的隐私评估方法，LLM在其他NLP子领域作为评估器已取得显著成功，因此探索LLM是否也能用于隐私评估

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge范式，在10个数据集上使用13个LLM模型，并与677名人类参与者的评估结果进行对比分析

Result: 隐私确实难以量化测量（人类间一致性较低），但LLM能够准确建模全局人类隐私视角，与人类隐私感知高度一致

Conclusion: LLM作为隐私评估器具有可行性，为使用创新技术解决方案解决紧迫隐私问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Despite advances in the field of privacy-preserving Natural Language
Processing (NLP), a significant challenge remains the accurate evaluation of
privacy. As a potential solution, using LLMs as a privacy evaluator presents a
promising approach $\unicode{x2013}$ a strategy inspired by its success in
other subfields of NLP. In particular, the so-called $\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$
paradigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language
evaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.
Recognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we
investigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the
privacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM
evaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a
study involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we
confirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,
exhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find
that LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through
an analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and
limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our
findings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy
evaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with
innovative technical solutions.

Method: 构建SEA-BED指标，包含169个人工构建的数据集，评估17个嵌入模型，分析任务难度、语言性能差异、人工与机器翻译影响

Result: 发现模型在东南亚语言上排名变化明显，表现不一致，尤其是低资源语言如缅甸语需要人工精检数据

Conclusion: 东南亚语言在嵌入模型评估中存在特殊挑战，建立人工构建的本土化指标对准确评估至关重要

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are essential for NLP tasks such as semantic search,
re-ranking, and textual similarity. Although multilingual benchmarks like MMTEB
broaden coverage, Southeast Asia (SEA) datasets are scarce and often
machine-translated, missing native linguistic properties. With nearly 700
million speakers, the SEA region lacks a region-specific embedding benchmark.
We introduce SEA-BED, the first large-scale SEA embedding benchmark with 169
datasets across 9 tasks and 10 languages, where 71% are formulated by humans,
not machine generation or translation. We address three research questions: (1)
which SEA languages and tasks are challenging, (2) whether SEA languages show
unique performance gaps globally, and (3) how human vs. machine translations
affect evaluation. We evaluate 17 embedding models across six studies,
analyzing task and language challenges, cross-benchmark comparisons, and
translation trade-offs. Results show sharp ranking shifts, inconsistent model
performance among SEA languages, and the importance of human-curated datasets
for low-resource languages like Burmese.

Abstract: Speech foundation models (SFMs) are designed to serve as general-purpose
representations for a wide range of speech-processing tasks. The last five
years have seen an influx of increasingly successful self-supervised and
supervised pre-trained models with impressive performance on various downstream
tasks.
  Although the zoo of SFMs continues to grow, our understanding of the
knowledge they acquire lags behind. This thesis presents a lightweight analysis
framework using statistical tools and training-free tasks to investigate the
acoustic and linguistic knowledge encoded in SFM layers. We conduct a
comparative study across multiple SFMs and statistical tools. Our study also
shows that the analytical insights have concrete implications for downstream
task performance.
  The effectiveness of an SFM is ultimately determined by its performance on
speech applications. Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to
spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding
than widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration
of SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this
thesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)
and named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding
Evaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find
that end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded
(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate
E2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on
task performance.
  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,
providing tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the
community to make informed design choices for future model development and
adoption.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning across diverse domains. However, effective reasoning in real-world
tasks requires adapting the reasoning strategy to the demands of the problem,
ranging from fast, intuitive responses to deliberate, step-by-step reasoning
and tool-augmented thinking. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, we
propose a novel taxonomy of LLM reasoning strategies along two knowledge
boundaries: a fast/slow boundary separating intuitive from deliberative
processes, and an internal/external boundary distinguishing reasoning grounded
in the model's parameters from reasoning augmented by external tools. We
systematically survey recent work on adaptive reasoning in LLMs and categorize
methods based on key decision factors. We conclude by highlighting open
challenges and future directions toward more adaptive, efficient, and reliable
LLMs.

knowledge or reasoning abilities. In this paper, we explore a different type of
evaluation: whether an LLM can predict aspects of its own responses. Since LLMs
lack the ability to execute themselves, we introduce the Self-Execution
Benchmark, which measures a model's ability to anticipate properties of its
output, such as whether a question will be difficult for it, whether it will
refuse to answer, or what kinds of associations it is likely to produce. Our
experiments show that models generally perform poorly on this benchmark, and
that increased model size or capability does not consistently lead to better
performance. These results suggest a fundamental limitation in how LLMs
represent and reason about their own behavior.

TL;DR: LegalΔ是一个强化学习框架，通过思维链引导的信息增益来增强法律推理能力，在准确性和可解释性方面优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律大语言模型在生成可靠和可解释的推理过程方面存在困难，往往直接给出答案而缺乏多步推理，限制了在复杂法律场景中的应用效果。

Method: 采用双模式输入（直接答案模式和推理增强模式），最大化两者间的信息增益；两阶段方法：1)从DeepSeek-R1蒸馏潜在推理能力 2)通过差分比较和多维奖励机制（评估结构连贯性和法律领域特异性）精炼推理质量。

Result: 在多个法律推理任务上的实验结果表明，LegalΔ在准确性和可解释性方面均优于强基线模型，能够产生更稳健和可信的法律判断，且不依赖标注的偏好数据。

Conclusion: LegalΔ框架成功解决了法律AI中推理过程不可靠和不可解释的问题，为复杂法律场景提供了有效的解决方案，所有代码和数据将开源。

Abstract: Legal Artificial Intelligence (LegalAI) has achieved notable advances in
automating judicial decision-making with the support of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, existing legal LLMs still struggle to generate reliable and
interpretable reasoning processes. They often default to fast-thinking behavior
by producing direct answers without explicit multi-step reasoning, limiting
their effectiveness in complex legal scenarios that demand rigorous
justification. To address this challenge, we propose Legal$\Delta$, a
reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance legal reasoning through
chain-of-thought guided information gain. During training, Legal$\Delta$
employs a dual-mode input setup-comprising direct answer and
reasoning-augmented modes-and maximizes the information gain between them. This
encourages the model to acquire meaningful reasoning patterns rather than
generating superficial or redundant explanations. Legal$\Delta$ follows a
two-stage approach: (1) distilling latent reasoning capabilities from a
powerful Large Reasoning Model (LRM), DeepSeek-R1, and (2) refining reasoning
quality via differential comparisons, combined with a multidimensional reward
mechanism that assesses both structural coherence and legal-domain specificity.
Experimental results on multiple legal reasoning tasks demonstrate that
Legal$\Delta$ outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and
interpretability. It consistently produces more robust and trustworthy legal
judgments without relying on labeled preference data. All code and data will be
released at https://github.com/NEUIR/LegalDelta.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种融合法律逻辑的深度学习模型MT-DT，用于解决现有智能司法辅助系统在罚金预测方面的不足，通过多任务双轨理论模型提升了预测准确性并验证了法律逻辑的有效性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能司法辅助系统缺乏专门的罚金预测方法，且现有研究多依赖数据驱动方法忽视了司法决策的法律逻辑基础。罚金适用性需要综合分析犯罪情节和悔罪表现，而不仅仅是数据分析。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将法律逻辑融入深度学习模型，为罚金预测提供了更加符合司法逻辑的方法论，补充了现有智能司法系统在这一领域的空白，对于提升司法决策的科学性和公正性具有重要意义。

Abstract: Probation is a crucial institution in modern criminal law, embodying the
principles of fairness and justice while contributing to the harmonious
development of society. Despite its importance, the current Intelligent
Judicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation
prediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation
eligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a
comprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the
existing research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which
often overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To
address this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into
deep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct
stages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact
descriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct
probation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation
Prediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and
the \textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the
probation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,
and an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Method: 提出一种成本效益的方法，利用事实检查数据集构建NATCONFQA标准数据集，包含详细的冲突标签，并对8个高端大语言模型进行评测。

Result: 测试显示大语言模型在处理各种类型冲突时表现脆弱，采用的冲突解决策略存在缺陷。

Conclusion: 该研究为冲突感知多答案问答领域提供了一个现实的标准数据集，并揭示了当前大语言模型在该任务上的不足，为进一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in question
answering (QA) tasks. However, Multi-Answer Question Answering (MAQA), where a
question may have several valid answers, remains challenging. Traditional QA
settings often assume consistency across evidences, but MAQA can involve
conflicting answers. Constructing datasets that reflect such conflicts is
costly and labor-intensive, while existing benchmarks often rely on synthetic
data, restrict the task to yes/no questions, or apply unverified automated
annotation. To advance research in this area, we extend the conflict-aware MAQA
setting to require models not only to identify all valid answers, but also to
detect specific conflicting answer pairs, if any. To support this task, we
introduce a novel cost-effective methodology for leveraging fact-checking
datasets to construct NATCONFQA, a new benchmark for realistic, conflict-aware
MAQA, enriched with detailed conflict labels, for all answer pairs. We evaluate
eight high-end LLMs on NATCONFQA, revealing their fragility in handling various
types of conflicts and the flawed strategies they employ to resolve them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型(SLMs)成本低但推理能力有限，现有方法往往在推理能力、自主性或泛化性方面存在缺陷，需要一种综合解决方案。

Method: 提出ReaLM框架：1) MRPV对比正负推理路径提取关键模式；2) EAAI逐步减少外部信号依赖；3) 引导式思维链蒸馏编码领域知识。

Result: 在垂直领域和通用推理任务上的大量实验表明，ReaLM显著提升了SLM在推理能力、自主性和泛化性三个方面的性能。

Conclusion: ReaLM为小语言模型提供了有效的推理增强方案，通过综合方法解决了现有技术的局限性，在保持成本效益的同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) are a cost-effective alternative to Large
Language Models (LLMs), but often struggle with complex reasoning due to their
limited capacity and a tendency to produce mistakes or inconsistent answers
during multi-step reasoning. Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,
but typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning
capability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths
and limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on
externally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers
when models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce
ReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient
reasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose
Multi-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and
negative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on
external guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via
Asymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external
signals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought
distillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM
parameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive
experiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM
significantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.

TL;DR: MedKGent是一个基于LLM代理的框架，用于构建时间演化的医学知识图谱，通过提取器和构造器代理从PubMed摘要中增量构建高质量KG，准确率接近90%，在医学问答基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前知识图谱构建方法要么依赖监督流水线（泛化性有限），要么简单聚合LLM输出，忽略了生物医学知识的时序动态和上下文不确定性。需要一种能够处理知识演化的医学KG构建方法。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型驱动的两个专业代理：提取器代理通过采样估计识别知识三元组并分配置信度分数；构造器代理根据置信度和时间戳增量整合三元组到时间演化图中。基于1975-2023年1000万篇PubMed摘要构建。

Result: 构建了包含156,275个实体和2,971,384个关系三元组的KG。质量评估显示准确率接近90%，具有强评分者一致性。在7个医学问答基准测试中使用5个领先LLM进行RAG，相比无增强基线持续获得显著改进。

Conclusion: MedKGent框架成功构建了高质量的时间演化医学知识图谱，在知识提取准确性、下游任务性能和实际应用（如药物重定位）方面都表现出色，为大规模医学知识管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of medical literature presents growing challenges for
structuring and integrating domain knowledge at scale. Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
offer a promising solution by enabling efficient retrieval, automated
reasoning, and knowledge discovery. However, current KG construction methods
often rely on supervised pipelines with limited generalizability or naively
aggregate outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), treating biomedical
corpora as static and ignoring the temporal dynamics and contextual uncertainty
of evolving knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a
LLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.
Leveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we
simulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time
series. MedKGent incrementally builds the KG in a day-by-day manner using two
specialized agents powered by the Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct model. The Extractor
Agent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via
sampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions
and inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally
integrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by
confidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve
conflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational
triples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts
demonstrate an accuracy approaching 90\%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To
evaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question
answering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing
significant improvements over non-augmented baselines. Case studies further
demonstrate the KG's value in literature-based drug repurposing via
confidence-aware causal inference.

Method: 开发了混合NLP流水线，集成规则基命名实体识别和BERT基础断言检测模块，并与临床专家合作建立了全面的PASC词典。使用来自11个健康系统的160份进展记录进行模型开发和评估。

Result: 在断言检测任务中，单个区域内部验证F1得分0.82，10个区域外部验证F1得分0.76。流水线处理每份记录平均耗2.448秒。Spearman相关性测试显示阳性提及相关系数ρ>0.83，阴性提及ρ>0.72，均具有统计显著性。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC)
remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and
variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural
language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity
recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom
extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a
comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of
the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress
notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes
for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of
0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation
for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\pm 0.812$
seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\rho >0.83$ for positive
mentions and $\rho >0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential
for improving PASC diagnosis.

Motivation: 大型语言模型处理长上下文时KV缓存消耗巨大，现有方法虽然能减少内存占用但会带来额外的张量访问延迟

Method: 设计新标准强制将检索头和流式头分别聚集在不同层，避免同一层内混合计算带来的额外延迟

Result: 在减少延迟的同时仅带来可忽略的性能下降，在基准测试中表现竞争力

Conclusion: ZigzagAttention通过层间头类型分离有效解决了KV缓存优化中的延迟问题

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), handling long
context has become one of the vital abilities in LLMs. Such long-context
ability is accompanied by difficulties in deployment, especially due to the
increased consumption of KV cache. There is certain work aiming to optimize the
memory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads
can be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and
streaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the
streaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would
largely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much. However,
since employing both retrieval and streaming heads in one layer decomposes one
large round of attention computation into two small ones, it may unexpectedly
bring extra latency on accessing and indexing tensors. Based on this intuition,
we impose an important improvement to the identification process of retrieval
and streaming heads, in which we design a criterion that enforces exclusively
retrieval or streaming heads gathered in one unique layer. In this way, we
further eliminate the extra latency and only incur negligible performance
degradation. Our method named \textsc{ZigzagAttention} is competitive among
considered baselines owing to reduced latency and comparable performance.

Method: 构建文化探针数据集(CPD)包含200个提示，重点考察个人主义-集体主义(IDV)和权力距离(PDI)两个文化维度，使用标准化零样本提示比较GPT-4和ERNIE Bot

Result: 两模型在两个维度上呈现显著差异(p<0.001)，GPT-4呈现个人主义(IDV得1.21)和低权力距离(PDI得分-1.05)倾向，ERNIE Bot呈现集体主义(IDV得分-0.89)和高权力距离(PDI得分0.76)倾向，文化对齐指数显示GPT-4更接近美国倾向，ERNIE Bot更接近中国倾向

Conclusion: 大语言模型是其训练语料库的统计镜像，具有系统性的文化偏向，需要文化意识的评估和部署以避免算法文化霸权

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, yet their underlying
cultural and ethical assumptions remain underexplored. We propose the notion of
a "cultural gene" -- a systematic value orientation that LLMs inherit from
their training corpora -- and introduce a Cultural Probe Dataset (CPD) of 200
prompts targeting two classic cross-cultural dimensions:
Individualism-Collectivism (IDV) and Power Distance (PDI). Using standardized
zero-shot prompts, we compare a Western-centric model (GPT-4) and an
Eastern-centric model (ERNIE Bot). Human annotation shows significant and
consistent divergence across both dimensions. GPT-4 exhibits individualistic
and low-power-distance tendencies (IDV score approx 1.21; PDI score approx
-1.05), while ERNIE Bot shows collectivistic and higher-power-distance
tendencies (IDV approx -0.89; PDI approx 0.76); differences are statistically
significant (p < 0.001). We further compute a Cultural Alignment Index (CAI)
against Hofstede's national scores and find GPT-4 aligns more closely with the
USA (e.g., IDV CAI approx 0.91; PDI CAI approx 0.88) whereas ERNIE Bot aligns
more closely with China (IDV CAI approx 0.85; PDI CAI approx 0.81). Qualitative
analyses of dilemma resolution and authority-related judgments illustrate how
these orientations surface in reasoning. Our results support the view that LLMs
function as statistical mirrors of their cultural corpora and motivate
culturally aware evaluation and deployment to avoid algorithmic cultural
hegemony.

Result: 发现长输入上下文提升动力学预测性能，SAE抓取的特征与关键物理变量(如能量)呈现相关性

Conclusion: 这为理解LLM如何在上下文学习中编码有意义的概念提供了新案例，扩展了对模型学习机制的认识

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉-语言模型在复杂多模态指令跟随方面具有巨大潜力，但人工标注成本高、不一致性严重限制了其发展。传统的监督微调和现有偏好优化方法对于发现高信息密度的"难以识别的负面"样本效果很差。

Method: 提出M3PO方法，通过多模态对齐分数(MAS)评估外部质量，结合模型自身一致性/信心(log概率)评估内部信念，形成新的M3P-Score。该分数特别识别模型自信但错误的关键偏好对边样本，然后使用LoRA技术对基础LVLM进行直接偏好优化(DPO)微调。

Result: 在多个多模态指令跟随测试集(MME-Bench, POPE, IFT, 人类偏好分数)上，M3PO一贵表现超过传统SFT、模拟RLHF、普通DPO和RM-DPO等强力基线方法。

Conclusion: M3PO提供了一种数据高效的方法来提升大规模视觉-语言模型的多模态指令跟随能力，通过智能选择最有学习价值的偏好对边样本，充分利用模型自身生成空间来识别关键的负面样本，实现了更高效的偏好对齐调整。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) hold immense potential for complex
multimodal instruction following, yet their development is often hindered by
the high cost and inconsistency of human annotation required for effective
fine-tuning and preference alignment. Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently
struggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify
highly informative "hard negative" samples. To address these challenges, we
propose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and
data-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual
instruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most "learning-valuable"
preference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This
selection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial
signals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the
model's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal
belief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically
identifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the
model might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality
preference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong
baselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a
comprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,
POPE, IFT, Human Pref. Score).

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，印尼语与其他低资源语言性能存在明显差距；使用区域特定模型与通用多语言模型相比没有明显优势；语域变化（特别是社交媒体中不常见的高级礼貌语域）显著影响模型性能。

Conclusion: 印尼低资源语言NLP仍面临重大挑战，需要更多针对性的研究和模型开发，特别是在处理不同语域和低资源语言方面。

Abstract: As one of the world's most populous countries, with 700 languages spoken,
Indonesia is behind in terms of NLP progress. We introduce LoraxBench, a

diverse tasks: reading comprehension, open-domain QA, language inference,
causal reasoning, translation, and cultural QA. Our dataset covers 20
languages, with the addition of two formality registers for three languages. We
evaluate a diverse set of multilingual and region-focused LLMs and found that
this benchmark is challenging. We note a visible discrepancy between
performance in Indonesian and other languages, especially the low-resource
ones. There is no clear lead when using a region-specific model as opposed to
the general multilingual model. Lastly, we show that a change in register

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenAI发布GPT-OSS开源大模型（20B和120B参数），评估显示20B版本在多项基准测试中优于120B版本，表明稀疏架构的扩展不一定带来性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估OpenAI首个开源大模型GPT-OSS的性能表现，比较不同参数规模的稀疏架构模型在各项任务中的表现，为开源模型选择提供实证依据

Method: 在10个基准测试上评估6个开源大模型（14.7B-235B参数），包括通用知识、数学推理、代码生成、多语言理解和对话能力，使用标准化推理设置和McNemar检验进行统计验证

Result: GPT-OSS-20B在HumanEval和MMLU等多个基准上表现优于GPT-OSS-120B，且内存和能耗更低；两个模型在开源模型中处于中游水平，代码生成较强但多语言能力较弱

Conclusion: 稀疏架构的扩展不一定带来性能的线性提升，需要进一步研究优化策略，为未来开源部署提供更高效的模型选择指导

Abstract: In August 2025, OpenAI released GPT-OSS models, its first open weight large
language models since GPT-2 in 2019, comprising two mixture of experts
architectures with 120B and 20B parameters. We evaluated both variants against
six contemporary open source large language models ranging from 14.7B to 235B
parameters, representing both dense and sparse designs, across ten benchmarks
covering general knowledge, mathematical reasoning, code generation,
multilingual understanding, and conversational ability. All models were tested
in unquantised form under standardised inference settings, with statistical
validation using McNemars test and effect size analysis. Results show that
gpt-oss-20B consistently outperforms gpt-oss-120B on several benchmarks, such
as HumanEval and MMLU, despite requiring substantially less memory and energy
per response. Both models demonstrate mid-tier overall performance within the
current open source landscape, with relative strength in code generation and
notable weaknesses in multilingual tasks. These findings provide empirical
evidence that scaling in sparse architectures may not yield proportional
performance gains, underscoring the need for further investigation into
optimisation strategies and informing more efficient model selection for future
open source deployments.

### [98] [The Structural Sources of Verb Meaning Revisited: Large Language Models Display Syntactic Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12482)
*Xiaomeng Zhu,R. Thomas McCoy,Robert Frank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过在语言模型中测试语法起动假设f发现，语言模型也体现了类似于儿童的语法起动机制，尤其是在动词学习方面


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验大型语言模型是否也体现语法起动假设，即通过语法环境学习动词意义的行为

Method: 在RoBERTa和GPT-2模型上进行实验，通过测试语法信息和共现信息被消除后模型表现的变化，对比语法起动和共现起动的效果

Result: 模型的动词表征在语法线索被移除时更容易退化，尤其是心理动词的表征受影响更大，而名词表征则更受共现信息影响

Conclusion: 证实了语法起动在动词学习中的重要作用，并且证明了通过操控语言模型的学习环境来大规模测试发育假设的可行性

Abstract: Syntactic bootstrapping (Gleitman, 1990) is the hypothesis that children use
the syntactic environments in which a verb occurs to learn its meaning. In this
paper, we examine whether large language models exhibit a similar behavior. We
do this by training RoBERTa and GPT-2 on perturbed datasets where syntactic
information is ablated. Our results show that models' verb representation
degrades more when syntactic cues are removed than when co-occurrence
information is removed. Furthermore, the representation of mental verbs, for
which syntactic bootstrapping has been shown to be particularly crucial in
human verb learning, is more negatively impacted in such training regimes than
physical verbs. In contrast, models' representation of nouns is affected more
when co-occurrences are distorted than when syntax is distorted. In addition to
reinforcing the important role of syntactic bootstrapping in verb learning, our
results demonstrated the viability of testing developmental hypotheses on a
larger scale through manipulating the learning environments of large language
models.

TL;DR: CDCR-SFT是一个监督微调框架，通过训练LLMs显式构建变量级有向无环图并进行推理，显著提升因果推理能力并减少幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs的推理方法（如Chain-of-Thought）在语言标记层面操作，缺乏对变量间因果关系的建模能力，无法表示条件独立性或满足因果识别假设

Method: 提出CDCR-SFT框架，训练LLMs显式构建变量级DAG并在其上进行推理；构建包含25,368个样本的CausalDR数据集，每个样本包含输入问题、显式因果DAG、基于图的推理轨迹和验证答案

Result: 在8个任务的4个LLMs上实验显示：CDCR-SFT在CLADDER上达到95.33%的最先进准确率（首次超越人类表现的94.8%），在HaluEval上减少10%的幻觉

Conclusion: 在LLMs中显式建模因果结构可以有效减轻输出中的逻辑不一致性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit logically inconsistent hallucinations
that appear coherent yet violate reasoning principles, with recent research
suggesting an inverse relationship between causal reasoning capabilities and
such hallucinations. However, existing reasoning approaches in LLMs, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its graph-based variants, operate at the linguistic
token level rather than modeling the underlying causal relationships between
variables, lacking the ability to represent conditional independencies or
satisfy causal identification assumptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce
causal-DAG construction and reasoning (CDCR-SFT), a supervised fine-tuning
framework that trains LLMs to explicitly construct variable-level directed
acyclic graph (DAG) and then perform reasoning over it. Moreover, we present a
dataset comprising 25,368 samples (CausalDR), where each sample includes an
input question, explicit causal DAG, graph-based reasoning trace, and validated
answer. Experiments on four LLMs across eight tasks show that CDCR-SFT improves
the causal reasoning capability with the state-of-the-art 95.33% accuracy on
CLADDER (surpassing human performance of 94.8% for the first time) and reduces
the hallucination on HaluEval with 10% improvements. It demonstrates that
explicit causal structure modeling in LLMs can effectively mitigate logical
inconsistencies in LLM outputs. Code is available at

*Seonglae Cho,Zekun Wu,Adriano Koshiyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CorrSteer提出了一种基于相关性的稀疏自编码器特征选择方法，仅使用推理时激活就能自动提取相关特征进行模型引导，在多个任务上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统稀疏自编码器在引导任务中需要对比数据集或大量激活存储的限制，实现更高效和自动化的特征选择

Method: 通过将样本正确性与推理时生成的token的SAE激活进行相关性分析来选择特征，并使用平均激活自动获取引导系数

Result: 在Gemma 2 2B和LLaMA 3.1 8B上，QA、偏见缓解、越狱预防和推理基准任务表现显著提升，MMLU性能提高4.1%，HarmBench提升22.9%（仅需4000样本）

Conclusion: 基于相关性的特征选择是自动化SAE引导的有效且可扩展方法，所选特征展现出与任务需求一致的语义模式

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large
language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in
downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive
datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose
CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE
activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only
inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby avoiding
spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average
activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task
performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning
benchmarks on Gemma 2 2B and LLaMA 3.1 8B, notably achieving a +4.1%
improvement in MMLU performance and a +22.9% improvement in HarmBench with only
4000 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns
aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities
that drive performance. Our work establishes correlationbased selection as an
effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language
model applications.

*Maitreyi Chatterjee,Devansh Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Anchoring混合记忆架构，通过结合句法依赖、语篇关系和共指消解等显式语言线索来增强RAG系统的记忆持久性，在长期对话中比传统向量检索方法提升18%的召回率和语篇连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在长期多轮对话中受限于记忆持久性问题，传统RAG系统使用密集向量存储对话历史，虽然能捕获语义相似性但忽略了细粒度语言结构信息，导致对细微语境丰富交流的回忆能力不足。

Method: 提出混合代理记忆架构Semantic Anchoring，在向量存储基础上显式整合语言线索：包括依赖解析、语篇关系标注和共指消解，创建结构化记忆条目来增强记忆检索效果。

Result: 在适配的长期对话数据集上实验表明，语义锚定方法相比强RAG基线在事实召回和语篇连贯性方面提升高达18%，并通过消融研究、人工评估和错误分析验证了方法的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 显式整合语言结构信息能显著提升LLM在长期对话中的记忆性能，Semantic Anchoring架构为改善多会话交互效果提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and task
competence in conversational settings. However, their effectiveness in
multi-session and long-term interactions is hindered by limited memory
persistence. Typical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems store
dialogue history as dense vectors, which capture semantic similarity but
neglect finer linguistic structures such as syntactic dependencies, discourse
relations, and coreference links. We propose Semantic Anchoring, a hybrid
agentic memory architecture that enriches vector-based storage with explicit
linguistic cues to improve recall of nuanced, context-rich exchanges. Our
approach combines dependency parsing, discourse relation tagging, and
coreference resolution to create structured memory entries. Experiments on
adapted long-term dialogue datasets show that semantic anchoring improves
factual recall and discourse coherence by up to 18% over strong RAG baselines.
We further conduct ablation studies, human evaluations, and error analysis to
assess robustness and interpretability.

TL;DR: Avengers-Pro是一个测试时路由框架，通过动态分配查询给不同容量和效率的LLM，在性能和效率之间实现最优平衡，在6个基准测试中超越最强单模型7%准确率，同时显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在性能和效率之间的平衡挑战，GPT-5虽然提出了测试时路由，但需要一个更统一的解决方案来处理所有性能-效率权衡。

Method: 使用嵌入和聚类技术对输入查询进行分析，然后基于性能-效率评分将每个查询路由到最合适的模型，集成不同容量和效率的LLM。

Result: 在6个挑战性基准测试和8个领先模型上实现最先进结果：超越最强单模型(GPT-5-medium)7%平均准确率，以27%更低成本匹配最强模型性能，以63%更低成本达到90%性能，实现帕累托最优。

Conclusion: Avengers-Pro提供了一个统一的测试时路由框架，能够为任何给定的成本提供最高准确率，为任何给定的准确率提供最低成本，在性能-效率权衡方面实现了突破性进展。

Abstract: Balancing performance and efficiency is a central challenge in large language
model (LLM) advancement. GPT-5 addresses this with test-time routing,
dynamically assigning queries to either an efficient or a high-capacity model
during inference. In this work, we present Avengers-Pro, a test-time routing
framework that ensembles LLMs of varying capacities and efficiencies, providing
a unified solution for all performance-efficiency tradeoffs. The Avengers-Pro
embeds and clusters incoming queries, then routes each to the most suitable
model based on a performance-efficiency score. Across 6 challenging benchmarks
and 8 leading models -- including GPT-5-medium, Gemini-2.5-pro, and
Claude-opus-4.1 -- Avengers-Pro achieves state-of-the-art results: by varying a
performance-efficiency trade-off parameter, it can surpass the strongest single
model (GPT-5-medium) by +7% in average accuracy. Moreover, it can match the
average accuracy of the strongest single model at 27% lower cost, and reach
~90% of that performance at 63% lower cost. Last but not least, it achieves a
Pareto frontier, consistently yielding the highest accuracy for any given cost,
and the lowest cost for any given accuracy, among all single models. Code is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的语言指纹提取(LIFE)方法，通过分析LLM生成假新闻时的词汇概率分布异常，来检测电脑生成的假新闻，达到了领先的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，生成假新闻变得越来越容易，构成了严重社会威胁。传统方法主要关注文本内容本身，但电脑生成的假新闻在语言一致性和事实性上往往很高，微妖的伪造迹象难以发现。

Method: 通过分布差异分析，发现了提示引发的语言指纹：LLM在恶意提示下生成真假新闻时的统计性概率偏移。基于此，提出了语言指纹提取(LIFE)方法，通过重建词级概率分布来发现区分性模式。还利用关键片段技术来强化这些语言差异。

Result: 实验结果显示LIFE方法在LLM生成假新闻检测上达到了领先的性能水平，同时在人类编写的假新闻检测中也保持了高性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了一种有效的方法来检测电脑生成的假新闻，通过分析语言概率分布的微妖异常，能够发现传统文本分析方法难以检测的假新闻。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models, the generation of fake
news has become increasingly effortless, posing a growing societal threat and
underscoring the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Early efforts to
identify LLM-generated fake news have predominantly focused on the textual
content itself; however, because much of that content may appear coherent and
factually consistent, the subtle traces of falsification are often difficult to
uncover. Through distributional divergence analysis, we uncover prompt-induced
linguistic fingerprints: statistically distinct probability shifts between
LLM-generated real and fake news when maliciously prompted. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel method named Linguistic Fingerprints Extraction
(LIFE). By reconstructing word-level probability distributions, LIFE can find
discriminative patterns that facilitate the detection of LLM-generated fake
news. To further amplify these fingerprint patterns, we also leverage
key-fragment techniques that accentuate subtle linguistic differences, thereby
improving detection reliability. Our experiments show that LIFE achieves
state-of-the-art performance in LLM-generated fake news and maintains high
performance in human-written fake news. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: 通过使用受控语言混合方法生成的合成代码转换文本对LLM进行微调，可以显著提升低资源语言的常识推理性能，同时保持或增强高资源语言的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在低资源语言（如印地语、斯瓦希里语）的常识推理任务中表现远不如高资源语言（如英语），这种性能差距影响了语言公平性，需要解决这种不一致的访问质量。

Method: 提出使用受控语言混合方法生成合成代码转换文本，然后基于这些合成数据集对LLM进行微调。还创建了基于CommonSenseQA数据集的新合成代码转换文本数据集，包含三种不同的语言比例配置。

Result: 实证研究表明，在合成代码转换数据集上微调LLM可以显著提高低资源语言的模型性能，同时保持或增强高资源语言的性能。

Conclusion: 通过合成代码转换文本的微调方法，能够有效弥合LLM在不同语言资源水平下的性能差距，促进跨语言社区的公平性。

Abstract: Cutting-edge LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for multilingual
communication and understanding. However, LLMs perform worse in Common Sense
Reasoning (CSR) tasks when prompted in low-resource languages (LRLs) like Hindi
or Swahili compared to high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Equalizing
this inconsistent access to quality LLM outputs is crucial to ensure fairness
for speakers of LRLs and across diverse linguistic communities. In this paper,
we propose an approach to bridge this gap in LLM performance. Our approach
involves fine-tuning an LLM on synthetic code-switched text generated using
controlled language-mixing methods. We empirically demonstrate that fine-tuning
LLMs on synthetic code-switched datasets leads to substantial improvements in
LRL model performance while preserving or enhancing performance in HRLs.
Additionally, we present a new dataset of synthetic code-switched text derived
from the CommonSenseQA dataset, featuring three distinct language ratio
configurations.

Motivation: 探索LLM在情感预测任务中的性能，特别是在动态情感推理方面的潜力

Method: 采用回归模型进行0-100分数预测，测试零棕提示、少棕提示和基于BERT的检索提示策略，并设计"痛苦游戏表演"框架进行多轮测试

Result: 少棕方法持续超过零棕基线，游戏化评估显示了LLM在动态情感推理任务中的广阔潜力

Conclusion: LLM能够有效预测人类情感响应，通过适当的提示策略和评估方法可以提升其在动态情感认知任务中的表现

Abstract: This study investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
predicting human-perceived misery scores from natural language descriptions of
real-world scenarios. The task is framed as a regression problem, where the
model assigns a scalar value from 0 to 100 to each input statement. We evaluate
multiple prompting strategies, including zero-shot, fixed-context few-shot, and
retrieval-based prompting using BERT sentence embeddings. Few-shot approaches
consistently outperform zero-shot baselines, underscoring the value of
contextual examples in affective prediction. To move beyond static evaluation,
we introduce the "Misery Game Show", a novel gamified framework inspired by a
television format. It tests LLMs through structured rounds involving ordinal
comparison, binary classification, scalar estimation, and feedback-driven
reasoning. This setup enables us to assess not only predictive accuracy but
also the model's ability to adapt based on corrective feedback. The gamified
evaluation highlights the broader potential of LLMs in dynamic emotional
reasoning tasks beyond standard regression. Code and data link:

Result: 实验表明ToolACE-MT能够实现高效、高效能和可通用的满意数据生成

Conclusion: 为工具增强型LLM场景提供了高质量数据构建的新范式

Abstract: Agentic task-solving with Large Language Models (LLMs) requires multi-turn,
multi-step interactions, often involving complex function calls and dynamic
user-agent exchanges. Existing simulation-based data generation methods for
such scenarios rely heavily on costly autoregressive interactions between
multiple LLM agents, thereby limiting real-world performance of agentic tasks.
In this paper, we propose a novel Non-Autoregressive Iterative Generation
framework, called ToolACE-MT, for constructing high-quality multi-turn agentic
dialogues. ToolACE-MT generates full conversational trajectories through three
stages: coarse-grained initialization, iterative refinement, and offline
verification. The initialization phase builds a structurally complete yet
semantically coarse dialogue skeleton; the iterative refinement phase
introduces realistic complexities and continued refinement via mask-and-fill
operations; and the offline verification phase ensures correctness and
coherence via rule- and model-based checks. Experiments demonstrate that
ToolACE-MT enables efficient, effective and generalizable agentic data
generation, offering a new paradigm for high-quality data construction in
tool-augmented LLM scenarios.

Result: 构建了两个大规模数据集DLR-Book(304万问题)和DLR-Web(166万问题)，覆盖75个学科。实验显示合成问题难度和多样性显著超越基线数据集，SFT训练使模型在多学科推理性能上超越官方基准模型。

Conclusion: DESIGNER框架能够有效合成高质量的多学科推理数据，显著提升LLMs的复杂推理能力，为解决LLMs在跨学科复杂推理方面的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many natural
language tasks but still struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning,
particularly across diverse disciplines. Existing reasoning datasets often
either lack disciplinary breadth or the structural depth necessary to elicit
robust reasoning behaviors. We propose DESIGNER: a DESIGN-logic-guidEd
Reasoning data synthesis pipeline that leverages naturally available, extensive
raw documents (book corpus and web corpus) to generate multidisciplinary
challenging questions. A core innovation of our approach is the introduction of
a Design Logic concept, which mimics the question-creation process of human
educators. We use LLMs to reverse-engineer and abstract over 120,000 design
logics from existing questions across various disciplines. By matching these
design logics with disciplinary source materials, we are able to create
reasoning questions that far surpass the difficulty and diversity of existing
datasets. Based on this pipeline, we synthesized two large-scale reasoning
datasets that span 75 disciplines: Design-Logic-Reasoning-Book (DLR-Book),
containing 3.04 million challenging questions synthesized from the book corpus,
and Design-Logic-Reasoning-Web (DLR-Web), with 1.66 million challenging
questions from the web corpus. Our data analysis demonstrates that the
questions synthesized by our method exhibit substantially greater difficulty
and diversity than those in the baseline datasets. We validate the
effectiveness of these datasets by conducting SFT experiments on the
Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-4B-Base models. The results show that our dataset
significantly outperforms existing multidisciplinary datasets of the same
volume. Training with the full datasets further enables the models to surpass
the multidisciplinary reasoning performance of the official Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-4B models.

Motivation: 现有LLM多语言安全评估缺乏全面性和多样性数据，限制了多语言安全对齐的发展，需要解决这一关键差距。

Method: 结合翻译、转创和本地化数据构建多语言数据集，建立包含直接/间接安全评估的多维度细粒度评估框架，包括过度敏感性评估。

Result: 不同领域和语言的安全性和有用性评估结果差异显著，即使是资源水平相似的语言也存在明显差异。

Conclusion: 全面评估LLM的多语言安全性对实现更平衡的安全对齐至关重要，LinguaSafe为深入研究多语言LLM安全提供了全面评估工具。

Abstract: The widespread adoption and increasing prominence of large language models
(LLMs) in global technologies necessitate a rigorous focus on ensuring their
safety across a diverse range of linguistic and cultural contexts. The lack of
a comprehensive evaluation and diverse data in existing multilingual safety
evaluations for LLMs limits their effectiveness, hindering the development of
robust multilingual safety alignment. To address this critical gap, we
introduce LinguaSafe, a comprehensive multilingual safety benchmark crafted
with meticulous attention to linguistic authenticity. The LinguaSafe dataset
comprises 45k entries in 12 languages, ranging from Hungarian to Malay. Curated
using a combination of translated, transcreated, and natively-sourced data, our
dataset addresses the critical need for multilingual safety evaluations of
LLMs, filling the void in the safety evaluation of LLMs across diverse
under-represented languages from Hungarian to Malay. LinguaSafe presents a
multidimensional and fine-grained evaluation framework, with direct and
indirect safety assessments, including further evaluations for oversensitivity.
The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across
different domains and different languages, even in languages with similar
resource levels. Our benchmark provides a comprehensive suite of metrics for
in-depth safety evaluation, underscoring the critical importance of thoroughly
assessing multilingual safety in LLMs to achieve more balanced safety
alignment. Our dataset and code are released to the public to facilitate
further research in the field of multilingual LLM safety.

TL;DR: CRED-SQL是一个针对大规模数据库的Text-to-SQL框架，通过聚类检索和执行描述语言来解决语义不匹配问题，在两个大型跨域基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然提升了Text-to-SQL系统的准确性，但在大规模数据库中，自然语言问题与SQL查询之间的语义不匹配问题仍然严重，特别是在语义相似的属性导致模式链接困难和语义漂移的情况下。

Method: CRED-SQL框架整合了聚类检索和执行描述：首先进行基于聚类的大规模模式检索来定位与自然语言问题最相关的表和列；然后引入中间自然语言表示——执行描述语言(EDL)，将任务分解为Text-to-EDL和EDL-to-SQL两个阶段。

Result: 在SpiderUnion和BirdUnion两个大规模跨域基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CRED-SQL达到了新的最先进性能，验证了其有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CRED-SQL通过创新的聚类检索和中间语言表示方法，有效解决了大规模数据库中Text-to-SQL的语义不匹配问题，展现了优异的性能和扩展能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
the accuracy of Text-to-SQL systems. However, a critical challenge remains: the
semantic mismatch between natural language questions (NLQs) and their
corresponding SQL queries. This issue is exacerbated in large-scale databases,
where semantically similar attributes hinder schema linking and semantic drift
during SQL generation, ultimately reducing model accuracy. To address these
challenges, we introduce CRED-SQL, a framework designed for large-scale
databases that integrates Cluster Retrieval and Execution Description. CRED-SQL
first performs cluster-based large-scale schema retrieval to pinpoint the
tables and columns most relevant to a given NLQ, alleviating schema mismatch.
It then introduces an intermediate natural language representation-Execution
Description Language (EDL)-to bridge the gap between NLQs and SQL. This
reformulation decomposes the task into two stages: Text-to-EDL and EDL-to-SQL,
leveraging LLMs' strong general reasoning capabilities while reducing semantic
deviation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale, cross-domain
benchmarks-SpiderUnion and BirdUnion-demonstrate that CRED-SQL achieves new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating its effectiveness and
scalability. Our code is available at https://github.com/smduan/CRED-SQL.git

TL;DR: SALAMANDRATA模型家族是针对38种欧洲语言的机器翻译任务优化的改进版本，提供2B和7B两种规模，采用持续预训练和监督微调的两阶段训练方法，并在WMT25翻译任务中应用了质量感知解码策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进SALAMANDRA LLMs模型，专门针对欧洲语言的翻译任务进行优化，提升多语言机器翻译性能，特别是为WMT25通用机器翻译共享任务做准备。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在平行数据上进行持续预训练，然后在高质量指令上进行监督微调。针对WMT25任务，还进行了词汇表扩展以适应非欧洲语言，并使用了最小贝叶斯风险解码和基于COMET的调优重排序策略。

Result: 开发了SALAMANDRATA 2B和7B两个版本的模型，并进一步推出了SALAMANDRATA-V2模型。这些模型已公开发布在Hugging Face平台上，专门针对38种欧洲语言的翻译任务进行了优化。

Conclusion: SALAMANDRATA模型家族通过改进的训练方法和解码策略，为多语言机器翻译任务提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在欧洲语言翻译方面表现出色，并为WMT25竞赛提供了强有力的技术基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the SALAMANDRATA family of models, an improved
iteration of SALAMANDRA LLMs (Gonzalez-Agirre et al., 2025) specifically
trained to achieve strong performance in translation-related tasks for 38
European languages. SALAMANDRATA comes in two scales: 2B and 7B parameters. For
both versions, we applied the same training recipe with a first step of
continual pre-training on parallel data, and a second step of supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality instructions. The BSC submission to the WMT25
General Machine Translation shared task is based on the 7B variant of
SALAMANDRATA. We first adapted the model vocabulary to support the additional
non-European languages included in the task. This was followed by a second
phase of continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, carefully designed
to optimize performance across all translation directions for this year's
shared task. For decoding, we employed two quality-aware strategies: Minimum
Bayes Risk Decoding and Tuned Re-ranking using COMET and COMET-KIWI
respectively. We publicly release both the 2B and 7B versions of SALAMANDRATA,
along with the newer SALAMANDRATA-V2 model, on Hugging Face1

Motivation: 医学大视觉语言模型存在事实不准确和输出不可靠的问题，当前的多模态RAG系统无法在异构数据源上进行有效检索，影响临床决策的可信度

Method: 构建MedAtlas多模态报告库，开发HeteroRAG框架：使用模态特定CLIP进行报告检索，多语料查询生成器动态构建查询，通过异构知识偏好调优实现跨模态多源知识对齐

Result: 在12个数据集和3种模态上的广泛实验表明，HeteroRAG在大多数医学视觉语言基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提高了Med-LVLMs的事实准确性和可靠性

Conclusion: HeteroRAG框架通过有效整合异构知识源，成功解决了医学大视觉语言模型的事实准确性问题，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的AI辅助工具

Abstract: Medical large vision-language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown promise in
clinical applications but suffer from factual inaccuracies and unreliable
outputs, posing risks in real-world diagnostics. While retrieval-augmented
generation has emerged as a potential solution, current medical multimodal RAG
systems are unable to perform effective retrieval across heterogeneous sources.
The irrelevance of retrieved reports affects the factuality of analysis, while
insufficient knowledge affects the credibility of clinical decision-making. To
bridge the gap, we construct MedAtlas, which includes extensive multimodal
report repositories and diverse text corpora. Based on it, we present
HeteroRAG, a novel framework that enhances Med-LVLMs through heterogeneous
knowledge sources. The framework introduces Modality-specific CLIPs for
effective report retrieval and a Multi-corpora Query Generator for dynamically
constructing queries for diverse corpora. Incorporating knowledge from such
multifaceted sources, Med-LVLM is then trained with Heterogeneous Knowledge
Preference Tuning to achieve cross-modality and multi-source knowledge
alignment. Extensive experiments across 12 datasets and 3 modalities
demonstrate that the proposed HeteroRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance
in most medical vision language benchmarks, significantly improving factual
accuracy and reliability of Med-LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前依靠结果奖励的强化学习方法存在奖励稀疏、梯度冲突等问题，限制了代理深度研究的性能提升

Method: 首先提出原子思维范式，将推理分解为细粒度功能单元，并使用推理奖励模型(RRM)提供原子思维奖励(ATR)。基于此构建Atom-Searcher RL框架，采用课程式奖励调度策略

Result: 在7个标准测试集上都实现了一致性提升，具有可扩展计算、推理过程可解释性强、更接近人类思维模式等优势

Conclusion: 原子思维和ATR机制有效解决了深度研究任务中的奖励指导问题，Atom-Searcher框架为代理智能研究提供了更高效、可解释的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities,
but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information,
yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid
workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to
autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current
approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical
issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance
gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic
Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into
fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward
Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained
guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for
agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher
uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR
early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on
effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent
improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1)
Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides
supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3)
Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了高资源标准语言对齐有助于低资源变体建模的假设，通过因果研究发现过度表示纠缠反而会阻碍生成建模，并提出在线变分探测框架进行解耦干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战高资源标准语言对齐有益于相关低资源变体建模的传统假设，研究表示纠缠对生成建模的负面影响，并为多语言多领域LLMs提供表示分配控制工具。

Method: 使用在线变分探测框架持续估计标准变体的子空间，在微调过程中进行基于投影的解耦干预，以阿拉伯语25种方言为案例进行研究。

Result: 在25种方言上，干预使生成质量平均提升+2.0 chrF++，最高提升+4.9 chrF++，尽管标准语言性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 提供了高资源变体子空间主导会限制相关变体生成能力的因果证据，统一了几何和信息论探测与子空间级因果干预，为密切相关的语言家族提供了实用的生成建模改进工具。

Abstract: Alignment with high-resource standard languages is often assumed to aid the
modeling of related low-resource varieties. We challenge this assumption by
demonstrating that excessive representational entanglement with a dominant
variety, such as Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) in relation to Arabic dialects,
can actively hinder generative modeling. We present the first comprehensive
causal study of this phenomenon by analyzing and directly intervening in the
internal representation geometry of large language models (LLMs). Our key
contribution is an online variational probing framework that continuously
estimates the subspace of the standard variety during fine-tuning, enabling
projection-based decoupling from this space. While our study uses Arabic as a
case due to its unusually rich parallel resources across 25 dialects, the
broader motivation is methodological: dialectal MT serves as a controlled proxy
for generative tasks where comparable multi-variety corpora are unavailable.
Across 25 dialects, our intervention improves generation quality by up to +4.9
chrF++ and +2.0 on average compared to standard fine-tuning, despite a measured
tradeoff in standard-language performance. These results provide causal
evidence that subspace dominance by high-resource varieties can restrict
generative capacity for related varieties. More generally, we unify geometric
and information-theoretic probing with subspace-level causal interventions,
offering practical tools for improving generative modeling in closely related
language families and, more broadly, for controlling representational
allocation in multilingual and multi-domain LLMs. Code will be released.

Abstract: We present our work to build a French semantic corpus by annotating French
dialogue in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR). Specifically, we annotate
the DinG corpus, consisting of transcripts of spontaneous French dialogues
recorded during the board game Catan. As AMR has insufficient coverage of the
dynamics of spontaneous speech, we extend the framework to better represent
spontaneous speech and sentence structures specific to French. Additionally, to
support consistent annotation, we provide an annotation guideline detailing
these extensions. We publish our corpus under a free license (CC-SA-BY). We
also train and evaluate an AMR parser on our data. This model can be used as an
assistance annotation tool to provide initial annotations that can be refined
by human annotators. Our work contributes to the development of semantic
resources for French dialogue.

TL;DR: 研究证明在社交媒体辱骂语言检测中，利用父推文的上下文特征能显著提升检测性能，其中基于内容的特征比基于账户的特征更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辱骂语言检测研究主要关注单个社交媒体帖子，忽略了周围帖子的上下文信息。本研究旨在探索利用父推文上下文是否有助于检测回复推文中的辱骂内容。

Method: 研究对话交流中的父推文-回复推文对，比较基于内容的特征和基于账户的特征，使用四种分类模型在标记数据集上进行测试。

Result: 融入上下文特征相比仅使用回复推文特征有显著改进，基于内容的特征比基于账户的特征贡献更大，组合多种特征效果最佳。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对辱骂语言检测至关重要，基于内容的特征组合能有效提升在对话场景中的检测性能。

Abstract: Abusive language detection has become an increasingly important task as a
means to tackle this type of harmful content in social media. There has been a
substantial body of research developing models for determining if a social
media post is abusive or not; however, this research has primarily focused on
exploiting social media posts individually, overlooking additional context that
can be derived from surrounding posts. In this study, we look at conversational
exchanges, where a user replies to an earlier post by another user (the parent
tweet). We ask: does leveraging context from the parent tweet help determine if
a reply post is abusive or not, and what are the features that contribute the
most? We study a range of content-based and account-based features derived from
the context, and compare this to the more widely studied approach of only
looking at the features from the reply tweet. For a more generalizable study,
we test four different classification models on a dataset made of
conversational exchanges (parent-reply tweet pairs) with replies labeled as
abusive or not. Our experiments show that incorporating contextual features
leads to substantial improvements compared to the use of features derived from
the reply tweet only, confirming the importance of leveraging context. We
observe that, among the features under study, it is especially the
content-based features (what is being posted) that contribute to the
classification performance rather than account-based features (who is posting
it). While using content-based features, it is best to combine a range of
different features to ensure improved performance over being more selective and
using fewer features. Our study provides insights into the development of
contextualized abusive language detection models in realistic settings
involving conversations.

Motivation: 虽然间接证据显示中世纪早期就常见基于口讲教学记录的文学作品，但很少有源材讨论这种实践。需要新方法来探索这些文档的编辑工作层次。

Method: 采用风格计量归因技术，基于最常见单词、词性标注和伪后缀进行分析。实施HTR流水线和自动化识别对齐技术。

Result: 这项研究将提供两个方法论改进：直接比较手工编写和自动提取数据的性能，以及验证基于transformer的OCR和转录对齐技术在中世纪拉丁语语料库中的有效性。

Conclusion: 如果成功，这项研究将为中世纪大学协作文学作品的探索性分析提供一个容易重用的模板，并为计算教育传统研究做出方法论贡献。

Abstract: While the indirect evidence suggests that already in the early scholastic
period the literary production based on records of oral teaching (so-called
reportationes) was not uncommon, there are very few sources commenting on the
practice. This paper details the design of a study applying stylometric
techniques of authorship attribution to a collection developed from
reportationes -- Stephen Langton's Quaestiones Theologiae -- aiming to uncover
layers of editorial work and thus validate some hypotheses regarding the
collection's formation. Following Camps, Cl\'erice, and Pinche (2021), I
discuss the implementation of an HTR pipeline and stylometric analysis based on
the most frequent words, POS tags, and pseudo-affixes. The proposed study will
offer two methodological gains relevant to computational research on the
scholastic tradition: it will directly compare performance on manually composed
and automatically extracted data, and it will test the validity of
transformer-based OCR and automated transcription alignment for workflows
applied to scholastic Latin corpora. If successful, this study will provide an
easily reusable template for the exploratory analysis of collaborative literary
production stemming from medieval universities.

<details>

Motivation: 探索转换器语言模型如何表征词汇意义，特别是是否存在类似于词汇库的语义信息存储机制。

Method: 提取RoBERTa-base模型的标记嵌入空间，使用k-means聚类算法将其分为200个聚类，然后通过人工检查和心理语言学指标（价值、具体性、象征性、禁忌性、获得年龄）进行分析。

Result: 发现标记嵌入空间中编码了广泛的语义信息，聚类结果显示出对语义信息的敏感性。

Conclusion: 转换器语言模型通过嵌入空间有效地编码了词汇的语义信息，这一发现推翻了认为模型不处理语义信息的"语义消过论"假设。

Abstract: We investigate how word meanings are represented in the transformer language
models. Specifically, we focus on whether transformer models employ something
analogous to a lexical store - where each word has an entry that contains
semantic information. To do this, we extracted the token embedding space of
RoBERTa-base and k-means clustered it into 200 clusters. In our first study, we
then manually inspected the resultant clusters to consider whether they are
sensitive to semantic information. In our second study, we tested whether the
clusters are sensitive to five psycholinguistic measures: valence,
concreteness, iconicity, taboo, and age of acquisition. Overall, our findings
were very positive - there is a wide variety of semantic information encoded
within the token embedding space. This serves to rule out certain "meaning
eliminativist" hypotheses about how transformer LLMs process semantic
information.

Conclusion: 该方法为语义表注释任务提供了高效、成本效益高的解决方案，有效解决了复杂表格注释的多重挑战

Abstract: The Semantic Table Annotation (STA) task, which includes Column Type
Annotation (CTA) and Cell Entity Annotation (CEA), maps table contents to
ontology entities and plays important roles in various semantic applications.
However, complex tables often pose challenges such as semantic loss of column
names or cell values, strict ontological hierarchy requirements, homonyms,
spelling errors, and abbreviations, which hinder annotation accuracy. To
address these issues, this paper proposes an LLM-based agent approach for CTA
and CEA. We design and implement five external tools with tailored prompts
based on the ReAct framework, enabling the STA agent to dynamically select
suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab
challenge, which contain the aforementioned challenges. Our method outperforms
existing approaches across various metrics. Furthermore, by leveraging
Levenshtein distance to reduce redundant annotations, we achieve a 70%
reduction in time costs and a 60% reduction in LLM token usage, providing an
efficient and cost-effective solution for STA.

Motivation: 现有自优化方法主要依赖固定迭代次数的被动过程，难以根据生成上下文动态确定最佳优化时机和内容，无法像人类思考那样在生成过程中实时优化。

Method: 提出ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR)方法，基于模型内部状态和演化上下文主动决定是否优化、何时优化以及如何优化，而不是重新生成整个响应。

Result: 在10个多样化任务上的实验表明，PASR显著提升问题解决性能。在Qwen3-8B上，相比标准生成平均减少41.6%的token消耗，同时准确率提升8.2%。

Conclusion: PASR通过主动式自优化实现了更高效和准确的输出生成，为LLM的自优化提供了新的动态决策范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-refinement have demonstrated significant potential
for improving the outputs of large language models (LLMs) through iterative
refinement. However, most existing self-refinement methods rely on a reactive
process with a fixed number of iterations, making it difficult to determine the
optimal timing and content of refinement based on the evolving generation
context. Inspired by the way humans dynamically refine their thoughts during
execution, we propose ProActive Self-Refinement (PASR), a novel method that
enables LLMs to refine their outputs during the generation process. Unlike
methods that regenerate entire responses, PASR proactively decides whether,
when, and how to refine based on the model's internal state and evolving
context. We conduct extensive experiments on a diverse set of 10 tasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of PASR. Experimental results show that PASR
significantly enhances problem-solving performance. In particular, on Qwen3-8B,
PASR reduces average token consumption by 41.6 percent compared to standard
generation, while also achieving an 8.2 percent improvement in accuracy. Our
code and all baselines used in the paper are available in the GitHub.

Result: 笔记本减少幻觉错误18%，协调器进一步减少错误13.5%，组合机制在TravelPlanner基准上达到25%通过率，相比单智能体基线7.5%有17.5%的绝对提升

Conclusion: 结构化信息共享和反射式协调是多智能体系统处理LLM长时程规划任务的关键组件，具有重要潜力

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MASs) have pushed the boundaries of large language model
(LLM) agents in domains such as web research and software engineering. However,
long-horizon, multi-constraint planning tasks involve conditioning on detailed
information and satisfying complex interdependent constraints, which can pose a
challenge for these systems. In this study, we construct an LLM-based MAS for a
travel planning task which is representative of these challenges. We evaluate
the impact of a notebook to facilitate information sharing, and evaluate an
orchestrator agent to improve coordination in free form conversation between
agents. We find that the notebook reduces errors due to hallucinated details by
18%, while an orchestrator directs the MAS to focus on and further reduce
errors by up to 13.5% within focused sub-areas. Combining both mechanisms
achieves a 25% final pass rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, a 17.5% absolute
improvement over the single-agent baseline's 7.5% pass rate. These results
highlight the potential of structured information sharing and reflective
orchestration as key components in MASs for long horizon planning with LLMs.

Abstract: LLM-based web agents have the potential to automate long-running web tasks,
such as finding offers for specific products in multiple online shops and
subsequently ordering the cheapest products that meet the users needs. This
paper introduces WebMall, a multi-shop online shopping benchmark for evaluating
the effectiveness and efficiency of web agents for comparison-shopping. WebMall
consists of four simulated online shops populated with authentic product offers
sourced from the Common Crawl, alongside a suite of 91 cross-shop tasks. These
tasks include basic tasks such as finding specific products in multiple shops,
performing price comparisons, adding items to the shopping cart, and completing
checkout. Advanced tasks involve searching for products based on vague
requirements, identifying suitable substitutes, and finding compatible
products. Compared to existing e-commerce benchmarks, such as WebShop or
ShoppingBench, WebMall introduces comparison-shopping tasks across multiple
shops. Furthermore, the product offers are more heterogeneous, as they
originate from hundreds of distinct real-world shops. The tasks in WebMall
require longer interaction trajectories than those in WebShop, while remaining
representative of real-world shopping behaviors. We evaluate eight baseline
agents on WebMall, varying in observation modality, memory utilization, and
underlying large language model (GPT 4.1 and Claude Sonnet 4). The
best-performing configurations achieve completion rates of 75% and 53%, and F1
scores of 87% and 63%, on the basic and advanced task sets, respectively.
WebMall is publicly released to facilitate research on web agents and to
promote advancements in navigation, reasoning, and efficiency within e-commerce
scenarios.

Method: 1) 将双模态讽刺检测模型的反馈损失整合到TTS训练中；2) 采用两阶段迁移学习：先在多样化语音风格数据集上微调，再在讽刺语音数据集上精调

Result: 主客观评估表明，所提方法显著提升了合成语音的质量、自然度和讽刺感知能力

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了讽刺语音合成的挑战，为生成高质量讽刺感知语音提供了可行方案

Abstract: Sarcastic speech synthesis, which involves generating speech that effectively
conveys sarcasm, is essential for enhancing natural interactions in
applications such as entertainment and human-computer interaction. However,
synthesizing sarcastic speech remains a challenge due to the nuanced prosody
that characterizes sarcasm, as well as the limited availability of annotated
sarcastic speech data. To address these challenges, this study introduces a
novel approach that integrates feedback loss from a bi-modal sarcasm detection
model into the TTS training process, enhancing the model's ability to capture
and convey sarcasm. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning, a speech
synthesis model pre-trained on read speech undergoes a two-stage fine-tuning
process. First, it is fine-tuned on a diverse dataset encompassing various
speech styles, including sarcastic speech. In the second stage, the model is
further refined using a dataset focused specifically on sarcastic speech,
enhancing its ability to generate sarcasm-aware speech. Objective and
subjective evaluations demonstrate that our proposed methods improve the
quality, naturalness, and sarcasm-awareness of synthesized speech.

parameters. To tackle the challenge of poor reasoning in Small Language Models
(SLMs), existing methods typically leverage LLMs to generate massive amounts of
data for cramming training. In psychology, they are akin to System 1 thinking,
which resolves reasoning problems rapidly based on experience and intuition.
However, human learning also requires System 2 thinking, where knowledge is
first acquired and then reinforced through practice. Inspired by such two
distinct modes of thinking, we propose a novel method based on the multi-LoRA
Interaction for mathematical reasoning Distillation (LoRID). First, we input
the question and reasoning of each sample into an LLM to create
knowledge-enhanced datasets. Subsequently, we train a LoRA block on the student
model as an Intuitive Reasoner (IR), which directly generates Chain-of-Thoughts
for problem-solving. Then, to imitate System 2 thinking, we train the Knowledge
Generator (KG) and Deep Reasoner (DR), respectively. The former outputs only
knowledge after receiving problems, while the latter uses that knowledge to
perform reasoning. Finally, to address the randomness in the generation of IR
and DR, we evaluate whether their outputs are consistent, and the inference
process needs to be iterated if not. This step can enhance the mathematical
reasoning ability of SLMs through mutual feedback. Experimental results show
that LoRID achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially on the GSM8K
dataset, where it outperforms the second-best method by 2.3%, 16.1%, 2.4%,
12.3%, and 1.8% accuracy across the five base models, respectively.

Abstract: Language models have made significant advancements in understanding and
generating human language, achieving remarkable success in various
applications. However, evaluating these models remains a challenge,
particularly for resource-limited languages like Turkish. To address this
issue, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive
evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is based on a
meticulously curated dataset comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions across
62 sections within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a
standard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of
LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text. In this study, we evaluated
state-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, highlighting areas for improvement in model
design. TR-MMLU sets a new standard for advancing Turkish NLP research and
inspiring future innovations.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的评价框架，用于评估对于形态丰富和低资源语言（如土耳其语）的标记化方法。研究发现语言特定标记百分比比标记纯度更能预测下游性能，并强调了面向语言特定的标记化方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记化是NLP中的基础预处理步骤，对大语言模型的语言和语义理解能力有重要影响。当前的标记化方法在处理形态丰富和低资源语言时面临特别挑战，需要专门的评价标准。

Method: 使用土耳其语MMLU（TR-MMLU）数据集（包含6,200道多选题），评估标记化器的词汇量、标记数量、处理时间、语言特定标记百分比（%TR）和标记纯度（%Pure）。这些新提出的指标用于衡量标记化器保留语言结构的有效性。

Result: 分析显示，语言特定标记百分比与下游性能（如MMLU分数）的相关性更强，而标记纯度的相关性较弱。仅增加模型参数并不能确保提升语言性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为形态复杂语言建立了健壮而实用的标记化标准。结果强调了面向语言特定的标记化方法的重要性，对于提升大语言模型在形态丰富语言中的表现具有重要意义。

Abstract: Tokenization is a fundamental preprocessing step in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), significantly impacting the capability of large language
models (LLMs) to capture linguistic and semantic nuances. This study introduces
a novel evaluation framework addressing tokenization challenges specific to
morphologically-rich and low-resource languages such as Turkish. Utilizing the
Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) dataset, comprising 6,200 multiple-choice questions from
the Turkish education system, we assessed tokenizers based on vocabulary size,
token count, processing time, language-specific token percentages (\%TR), and
token purity (\%Pure). These newly proposed metrics measure how effectively
tokenizers preserve linguistic structures. Our analysis reveals that
language-specific token percentages exhibit a stronger correlation with
downstream performance (e.g., MMLU scores) than token purity. Furthermore,
increasing model parameters alone does not necessarily enhance linguistic
performance, underscoring the importance of tailored, language-specific
tokenization methods. The proposed framework establishes robust and practical
tokenization standards for morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 开发一个公开的语音错误数据库，用于测试和评估语音识别模型在真实语音错误场景下的性能表现。

Method: 利用SFUSED数据库中系统标注的自发英语语音错误，包含意图和实际错误产生的标注，采用多维度分类体系（语言层级、上下文敏感性、词退化、词修正、词级和音节级错误定位）来评估WhisperX模型的转录准确性。

Result: 通过对5300个文档化的词汇和语音学错误进行分析，验证了该数据库作为ASR系统性能诊断工具的有效性。

Conclusion: SFUSED数据库的设计和标注方案能够有效用于语音识别模型的测试和评估，为模型性能诊断提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The Simon Fraser University Speech Error Database (SFUSED) is a public data
collection developed for linguistic and psycholinguistic research. Here we
demonstrate how its design and annotations can be used to test and evaluate
speech recognition models. The database comprises systematically annotated
speech errors from spontaneous English speech, with each error tagged for
intended and actual error productions. The annotation schema incorporates
multiple classificatory dimensions that are of some value to model assessment,
including linguistic hierarchical level, contextual sensitivity, degraded
words, word corrections, and both word-level and syllable-level error
positioning. To assess the value of these classificatory variables, we
evaluated the transcription accuracy of WhisperX across 5,300 documented word
and phonological errors. This analysis demonstrates the atabase's effectiveness
as a diagnostic tool for ASR system performance.

TL;DR: 提出ReCOR强化学习框架，通过自适应选择token生成顺序来提升语言模型在复杂推理任务上的性能，无需标注数据即可从文本中学习最优生成顺序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前因果语言模型和扩散模型使用固定或随机的token生成顺序，这与原始逻辑顺序存在偏差，导致在需要自适应生成顺序的复杂推理问题上表现不佳。

Method: 基于强化学习的ReCOR框架，通过token预测统计进行自监督，估计每个未填充token的预测难度，在训练和推理过程中自适应选择下一个要生成的token。

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理和规划数据集上，ReCOR表现出优于基线模型的性能，有时甚至超过使用真实顺序监督的oracle模型。

Conclusion: ReCOR证明了自适应token生成顺序对提升语言模型推理能力的重要性，为无监督学习最优生成顺序提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete
diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful
content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output
tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the
logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we
observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in
problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably,
which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated
by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a
reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent
token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by
token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every
unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and
inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines,
sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.

TL;DR: 创建了DocHPLT，这是目前最大的公开文档级翻译数据集，包含50种语言与英语的1.24亿对齐文档对，共42.6亿句子，为长上下文建模和文档级翻译提供重要基础设施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档级机器翻译资源仅适用于少数高资源语言，需要为全球社区提供训练和评估文档级翻译及长上下文建模的基础设施。

Method: 修改现有的网页提取流程以保持源文档的完整性，保留所有内容包括未对齐部分，而不是基于句子级数据拼接文档的重建方法。

Result: LLMs在DocHPLT上微调后显著优于现成的指令调优基线，特别是对低资源语言有显著改进。初步实验确定了文档级翻译的最佳训练上下文策略。

Conclusion: DocHPLT数据集在宽松许可下开源，为推进多语言文档级翻译提供了必要的基础设施，特别是在低资源语言方面表现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for
a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training
and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context
modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly
available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million
aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26
billion sentences, with further possibility to provide 2500 bonus pairs not
involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece
together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web
extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source,
retaining all content including unaligned portions. After our preliminary
experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level
translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially
outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly
dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset
under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing
multilingual document-level translation.

Motivation: 为了解决法律领域中大型语言模型的幻觉问题，需要将模型输出基于引用来源进行验证，确保法律研究的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 开发了端到端RAG管道，包含：(i)上下文感知查询翻译器分离文档引用和自然语言问题；(ii)使用SBERT和GTE嵌入的开源检索策略；(iii)结合RAGAS、BERTScore-F1和ROUGE-Recall的综合评估框架。

Result: 检索性能显著提升：Recall@K提高30-95%，Precision@K提升约2.5倍（K>4），开源管道在检索质量上可媲美专有方法，定制法律提示能产生更忠实和上下文相关的答案。

Conclusion: 通过任务感知的组件级调优，可以构建法律基础扎实、可复现且成本效益高的RAG系统，为法律研究提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucinations by grounding
large language model outputs in cited sources, a capability that is especially
critical in the legal domain. We present an end-to-end RAG pipeline that
revisits and extends the LegalBenchRAG baseline with three targeted
enhancements: (i) a context-aware query translator that disentangles document
references from natural-language questions and adapts retrieval depth and
response style based on expertise and specificity, (ii) open-source retrieval
strategies using SBERT and GTE embeddings that achieve substantial performance
gains (improving Recall@K by 30-95\% and Precision@K by $\sim$2.5$\times$ for
$K>4$) while remaining cost-efficient, and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation and
generation framework that combines RAGAS, BERTScore-F1, and ROUGE-Recall to
assess semantic alignment and faithfulness across models and prompt designs.
Our results show that carefully designed open-source pipelines can rival or
outperform proprietary approaches in retrieval quality, while a custom
legal-grounded prompt consistently produces more faithful and contextually
relevant answers than baseline prompting. Taken together, these contributions
demonstrate the potential of task-aware, component-level tuning to deliver
legally grounded, reproducible, and cost-effective RAG systems for legal
research assistance.

TL;DR: AutoBnB-RAG是一个基于检索增强生成的多智能体事件响应框架，通过集成外部知识源来提升LLM在网络安全决策中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM在事件响应中的推理能力受限于缺乏外部知识访问，需要增强其获取和利用外部信息的能力。

Method: 在AutoBnB框架基础上集成RAG技术，提供两种检索设置：技术文档检索(RAG-Wiki)和事件报告检索(RAG-News)，并在八种团队结构中进行评估。

Result: 检索增强显著提高了决策质量和成功率，能够重建复杂的多阶段网络攻击，在不同组织模型中均表现良好。

Conclusion: 将检索机制集成到基于LLM的多智能体系统中对网络安全决策具有重要价值。

Abstract: Incident response (IR) requires fast, coordinated, and well-informed
decision-making to contain and mitigate cyber threats. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise as autonomous agents in simulated IR settings,
their reasoning is often limited by a lack of access to external knowledge. In
this work, we present AutoBnB-RAG, an extension of the AutoBnB framework that
incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) into multi-agent incident
response simulations. Built on the Backdoors & Breaches (B&B) tabletop game
environment, AutoBnB-RAG enables agents to issue retrieval queries and
incorporate external evidence during collaborative investigations. We introduce
two retrieval settings: one grounded in curated technical documentation
(RAG-Wiki), and another using narrative-style incident reports (RAG-News). We
evaluate performance across eight team structures, including newly introduced
argumentative configurations designed to promote critical reasoning. To
validate practical utility, we also simulate real-world cyber incidents based
on public breach reports, demonstrating AutoBnB-RAG's ability to reconstruct
complex multi-stage attacks. Our results show that retrieval augmentation
improves decision quality and success rates across diverse organizational
models. This work demonstrates the value of integrating retrieval mechanisms
into LLM-based multi-agent systems for cybersecurity decision-making.

Motivation: 联系中心中LLM每日生成数百万个通话摘要，但其偏见性很少被研究，特别是操作偏见（如语言流畅性、讲者、话题等）

Method: 建立15个操作偏见维度的分类法，利用LLM作为零检测分类器，并使用信度间隔（JS散度）和覆盖率两个指标来量化偏见

Result: 对2500个真实通话进行分析，测试20个不同规模和系列的LLM，发现所有模型都存在系统性偏见

Conclusion: 操作偏见是LLM在联系中心摘要中的普遍问题，无论模型规模大小都存在，需要更多关注

Abstract: Abstractive summarization is a core application in contact centers, where
Large Language Models (LLMs) generate millions of summaries of call transcripts
daily. Despite their apparent quality, it remains unclear whether LLMs
systematically under- or over-attend to specific aspects of the transcript,
potentially introducing biases in the generated summary. While prior work has
examined social and positional biases, the specific forms of bias pertinent to
contact center operations - which we term Operational Bias - have remained
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce BlindSpot, a framework built upon
a taxonomy of 15 operational bias dimensions (e.g., disfluency, speaker, topic)
for the identification and quantification of these biases. BlindSpot leverages
an LLM as a zero-shot classifier to derive categorical distributions for each
bias dimension in a pair of transcript and its summary. The bias is then
quantified using two metrics: Fidelity Gap (the JS Divergence between
distributions) and Coverage (the percentage of source labels omitted). Using
BlindSpot, we conducted an empirical study with 2500 real call transcripts and
their summaries generated by 20 LLMs of varying scales and families (e.g., GPT,
Llama, Claude). Our analysis reveals that biases are systemic and present
across all evaluated models, regardless of size or family.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Commonsense validation evaluates whether a sentence aligns with everyday
human understanding, a critical capability for developing robust natural
language understanding systems. While substantial progress has been made in
English, the task remains underexplored in Arabic, particularly given its rich
linguistic diversity. Existing Arabic resources have primarily focused on
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), leaving regional dialects underrepresented
despite their prevalence in spoken contexts. To bridge this gap, we present two
key contributions: (i) we introduce MuDRiC, an extended Arabic commonsense
dataset incorporating multiple dialects, and (ii) a novel method adapting Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to Arabic commonsense reasoning, which enhances
semantic relationship modeling for improved commonsense validation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves superior
performance in Arabic commonsense validation. Our work enhances Arabic natural
language understanding by providing both a foundational dataset and a novel
method for handling its complex variations. To the best of our knowledge, we
release the first Arabic multi-dialect commonsense reasoning dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语言模型经过指令循环训练或RLHF后训练，语言模型的回应程度降低，导致水印检测效果受限。需要找到更有效的检测方法。

Method: 探索多种混合方案，将水印检测器与非水印检测器结合使用。

Result: 在广泛的实验条件下，混合方案在检测性能上超过了任何单一类型检测器。

Conclusion: 通过结合水印和非水印检测技术，可以显著提高大语言模型生成文本的检测效果。

Abstract: Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the
generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark
typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and
the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice,
especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning
or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection
based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether
detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark
ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing
performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of
experimental conditions.

TL;DR: OptimalThinkingBench是一个统一基准，用于评估LLMs的过度思考（overthinking）和思考不足（underthinking）问题，并鼓励开发在性能和效率之间取得平衡的最优思考模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在处理复杂任务时需要更多计算资源（过度思考简单问题），而非思考型LLMs虽然更快更便宜，但在困难推理问题上思考不足。这导致用户需要为每个查询选择最优模型，因此需要统一的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含两个子基准的统一评测框架：OverthinkingBench（72个领域的简单查询）和UnderthinkingBench（11个挑战性推理任务），使用新颖的思考调整准确率指标评估33种不同思考和非思考模型。

Result: 评估显示没有模型能在该基准上实现最优思考。思考型模型经常在简单查询上过度思考数百个token而性能没有提升，大型非思考模型则思考不足，表现不如更小的思考型模型。

Conclusion: 现有方法往往在一个子基准上改进的同时损害另一个子基准的表现，凸显了未来需要开发更好的统一最优模型来解决过度思考和思考不足的平衡问题。

Abstract: Thinking LLMs solve complex tasks at the expense of increased compute and
overthinking on simpler problems, while non-thinking LLMs are faster and
cheaper but underthink on harder reasoning problems. This has led to the
development of separate thinking and non-thinking LLM variants, leaving the
onus of selecting the optimal model for each query on the end user. In this
work, we introduce OptimalThinkingBench, a unified benchmark that jointly
evaluates overthinking and underthinking in LLMs and also encourages the
development of optimally-thinking models that balance performance and
efficiency. Our benchmark comprises two sub-benchmarks: OverthinkingBench,
featuring simple queries in 72 domains, and UnderthinkingBench, containing 11
challenging reasoning tasks. Using novel thinking-adjusted accuracy metrics, we
perform extensive evaluation of 33 different thinking and non-thinking models
and show that no model is able to optimally think on our benchmark. Thinking
models often overthink for hundreds of tokens on the simplest user queries
without improving performance. In contrast, large non-thinking models
underthink, often falling short of much smaller thinking models. We further
explore several methods to encourage optimal thinking, but find that these
approaches often improve on one sub-benchmark at the expense of the other,
highlighting the need for better unified and optimal models in the future.

Motivation: 大型语言模型开发成本高弹，需要通过小规模实验做决策，但现有评测基准的可靠性有待提高。

Method: 引入信号（评测基准区分模型好坏的能力）和噪音（评测对训练步长随机变化的敏感度）两个指标，提出了三种改进方案：改用更好的评测指标、筛选噪音子任务、平均中间检查点输出。

Result: 信噪比更高的评测基准在小规模实验中更可靠，噪音更小的基准有更低的缩放式增长预测错误。提出的三种方案都能显著提高评测的可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议在创建新评测基准或选择现有基准时，应该追求高信号和低噪音的评测方案。

Abstract: Developing large language models is expensive and involves making decisions
with small experiments, typically by evaluating on large, multi-task evaluation
suites. In this work, we analyze specific properties which make a benchmark
more reliable for such decisions, and interventions to design higher-quality
evaluation benchmarks. We introduce two key metrics that show differences in
current benchmarks: signal, a benchmark's ability to separate better models
from worse models, and noise, a benchmark's sensitivity to random variability
between training steps. We demonstrate that benchmarks with a better
signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable when making decisions at small scale,
and those with less noise have lower scaling law prediction error. These
results suggest that improving signal or noise will lead to more useful
benchmarks, so we introduce three interventions designed to directly affect
signal or noise. For example, we propose that switching to a metric that has
better signal and noise (e.g., perplexity rather than accuracy) leads to better
reliability and improved scaling law error. We also find that filtering noisy
subtasks, to improve an aggregate signal-to-noise ratio, leads to more reliable
multi-task evaluations. We also find that averaging the output of a model's
intermediate checkpoints to reduce noise leads to consistent improvements. We
conclude by recommending that those creating new benchmarks, or selecting which
existing benchmarks to use, aim for high signal and low noise. We use 30
benchmarks for these experiments, and 375 open-weight language models from 60M
to 32B parameters, resulting in a new, publicly available dataset of 900K
evaluation benchmark results, totaling 200M instances.

Conclusion: LLM内部表示确实包含更有效的特征用于检测生成文本，RepreGuard方法在多种场景下都表现出优异的检测性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Detecting content generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for
preventing misuse and building trustworthy AI systems. Although existing
detection methods perform well, their robustness in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios is still lacking. In this paper, we hypothesize that, compared to
features used by existing detection methods, the internal representations of
LLMs contain more comprehensive and raw features that can more effectively
capture and distinguish the statistical pattern differences between
LLM-generated texts (LGT) and human-written texts (HWT). We validated this
hypothesis across different LLMs and observed significant differences in neural
activation patterns when processing these two types of texts. Based on this, we
propose RepreGuard, an efficient statistics-based detection method.
Specifically, we first employ a surrogate model to collect representation of
LGT and HWT, and extract the distinct activation feature that can better
identify LGT. We can classify the text by calculating the projection score of
the text representations along this feature direction and comparing with a
precomputed threshold. Experimental results show that RepreGuard outperforms
all baselines with average 94.92% AUROC on both in-distribution (ID) and OOD
scenarios, while also demonstrating robust resilience to various text sizes and
mainstream attacks. Data and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection
models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model
derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance
contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of
78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object
detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge
devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed
data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for
time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform
for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

*Adrián Rodríguez-Muñoz,Manel Baradad,Phillip Isola,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过仅使用程序生成数据训练表征模型，结合视觉内存数据库，在多个认知任务上实现了与真实图像训练模型相当的性能，同时完全隔离真实图像数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度学习模型依赖大量真实图像数据所带来的数据潜在风险和法律问题，尝试通过程序生成数据完全替代真实图像进行模型训练。

Method: 仅使用程序生成数据训练表征模型，通过视觉内存（参考图像嵌入的显式数据库）来处理视视相似性、分类和语义分割任务，无需进一步训练。

Result: 在NIGHTS视觉相似性任务上与Places训练模型相差1%以内；在CUB200和Flowers102细粒度分类任务上分别超10%和15%；在ImageNet-1K分类任务上相差10%以内；在COCO零样本分割任务上与真实数据训练模型相差10%以内。

Conclusion: 程序生成数据可以在保持强劲性能的同时完全隔离真实图像数据，但对象内部表征差异导致的内存搜索错误是性能差距的主要原因。

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on
visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without
further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference
image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves
full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining
strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model
performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and
$15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within
$10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot
segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on
real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that
parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models,
resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining
performance gap.

TL;DR: 本文系统评使用FusionFM框架对四种眼科基础模型进行单模型和融合模型的综合评测，发现DINORET和RetiZero表现最优，融合策略在某些疾病预测中有轻微改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管眼科基础模型快速发展，但仍缺乏系统性评估来回答哪个模型表现最好、是否在不同任务上都有良好表现以及融合所有模型的效果如何等根本问题

Method: 提出FusionFM评估框架，包括两种融合方法，测试四个先进眼科FM（RETFound、VisionFM、RetiZero、DINORET）在眼科疾病检测（青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变、黄斑变性）和系统性疾病预测（糖尿病、高血压）上的表现，使用AUC和F1指标进行量化评估

Result: DINORET和RetiZero在眼科和系统疾病任务中表现最优，RetiZero在外部数据集上显示更强的沿半性。门控融合策略在预测青光眼、AMD和高血压时有轻微改善，但预测系统性疾病特别是外部群体的高血压仍面临挑战

Conclusion: 研究提供了眼科基础模型的证据基础评估，强调了模型融合的优势，并指出了提升临床应用性的策略方向

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by
improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology,
several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to
fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across
different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is
the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic
FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive
evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different
ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection
(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and
systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal
imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,
RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and
evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that
DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and
systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on
external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach
provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.
Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension
in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an
evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model
fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙颌面硬组织缺损严重影响患者生理功能、面部美观和心理健康，当前深度学习模型仅限于单组织场景和特定模态成像输入，导致泛化性差，在解剖保真度、计算效率和跨组织适应性之间存在权衡。

Method: 采用多模态融合编码方法，结合点云和多视角图像的互补优势，并引入基于分数的去噪模块来优化表面平滑度。构建了包含6,609名患者的口内扫描、CBCT和CT数据的大型多模态数据集。

Result: UniDCF在几何精度、结构完整性和空间准确性方面优于现有最先进方法。临床模拟显示重建设计时间减少99%，临床医生接受率超过94%。

Conclusion: UniDCF实现了快速、自动化、高保真度的重建，支持个性化和精确的修复治疗，简化临床工作流程，改善患者治疗效果。

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients'
physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being,
posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning
models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging
inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we
introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple
dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point
clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface
smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality
approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral
scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated
instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural
completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF
reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated
acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and
high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative
treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

TL;DR: Ovis2.5是一个多模态大语言模型的升级版本，采用原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理图像，避免固定分辨率分块带来的质量损失，并通过反思机制增强推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到开源模型的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决固定分辨率图像处理导致的细节丢失和全局布局破坏问题，特别是在视觉密集内容（如复杂图表）中，同时需要增强模型的推理能力，超越线性思维链的限制。

Method: 集成原生分辨率视觉Transformer处理可变分辨率图像，训练模型进行反思（包括自检和修订），采用五阶段课程学习（从基础视觉预训练到指令调优，再到DPO和GRPO对齐增强），使用多模态数据打包和混合并行技术提升效率。

Result: Ovis2.5-9B在OpenCompass多模态排行榜上平均得分78.3，相比前代Ovis2-8B有显著提升，在40B参数以下的开源MLLM中达到SOTA；Ovis2.5-2B得分73.9，在其规模级别建立SOTA。在STEM基准测试、接地任务、视频任务和复杂图表分析方面均取得领先结果。

Conclusion: Ovis2.5通过原生分辨率处理和反思推理机制，在多模态理解和推理能力方面实现了显著提升，为资源受限的端侧部署提供了高性能的小模型解决方案，在多个维度达到了开源模型的最先进水平。

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AVE数据集仅限于文本到文本或图像到文本设置，缺乏对产品视频支持、多样化属性覆盖和公开可用性的问题。

Method: 提出基于CLIP的混合专家过滤系统(CLIP-MoE)来移除不匹配的视频-产品对，确保数据质量。建立综合基准评估最先进的视频视觉语言模型。

Result: 视频到文本AVE仍然是一个具有挑战性的问题，特别是在开放设置中，现有模型在利用有效时间信息方面还有改进空间。

Conclusion: VideoAVE填补了视频AVE数据集的空白，为开发更先进的视频视觉语言模型提供了重要资源，展示了该领域仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product
information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited
to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos,
diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we
introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE
dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To
ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts
filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,
resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.
In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a
comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision
language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and
open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that
video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,
and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging
effective temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are

Motivation: 现代网络中恨恼图片通过文本和图像的细微互动传播隐式恨恼言论，而现有视觉-语言模型缺乏细粒度监督并容易受到隐式恨恼语的影响。

Method: 1）提示优化框架：系统性变化提示结构、监督粒度和训练模态。
2）多模态数据增强管道：使用多代理LLM-VLM设置生成2,479个偏假中立图片，通过隔离和重写恨恼模态来减少偏见相关性。

Result: 结构化提示提高了小模型的稳健性，InternVL2在二元和计数设置中获得最佳F1分数。增强管道成功减少了偏见相关性并改善了分类器的通用性。

Conclusion: 提示结构和数据组成与模型大小同样重要，目标增强可以支持更可信豖和上下文敏感的恨恼检测，为构建稳健公平的视觉-语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the
challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed
through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or
satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,
these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible
to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to
improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization
framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,
and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both
influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in
small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and
scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline
that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting
the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,
successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier
generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic
data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate
that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and
that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive
hate detection.

Motivation: 探索是否仅凭二阶几何线索就能替代卷积神经网络进行手写字符识别，提供一种可解释的手工特征替代方案。

Method: 使用三个手工特征图（曲率大小、曲率符号、梯度方向）作为多层感知机(MLP)分类器的输入，构建曲率-方向MLP模型。

Result: 在MNIST数字数据集上达到97%准确率，在EMNIST字母数据集上达到89%准确率。

Conclusion: 曲率基表示对手写字符图像具有强大的判别能力，深度学习优势可以通过可解释的手工工程特征实现。

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar
curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient
on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten
character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our
curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89
percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of
curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and
demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with
interpretable, hand-engineered features.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了高斯曲率在3D表面建模中的作用，提出高斯曲率作为一种稀疏缩结表征和几何先验知识，可以改善现有的单目和双目深度重建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法虽然表现出艰，但缺乏明确的3D几何模型，无法直接分析、跨模态转移或系统性修改。需要探索曲面几何特征在深度重建中的作用。

Method: 通过在Middlebury双目数据集上进行实验，研究高斯曲率的特性：观察者不变性、稀疏缩结表征能力、在现有方法中的隐式使用，以及作为无监督评量标准的可能性。

Result: 高斯曲率提供了一种稀疏但密集的3D表面描述，现有的单目和双目深度重建方法广泛地隐式考虑了高斯曲率，这种几何先验知识可以优化和改善3D表面重建。

Conclusion: 高斯曲率作为一种几何不变量，在3D表面建模中具有重要价值，既可以作为稀疏表征和几何先验，也可以用于无监督评估双目方法的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven
approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural
networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and
monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of
3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or
systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role
of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being
an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we
demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse
and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and
stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such
use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and
improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised
metric for stereo methods.

Motivation: 虽然GNN已广泛应用于图像演算的图表示下流任务，但还没有研究系统性比较不同图像到图象转换方法在图级异常检测中的效果。

Method: 系统评估了多种分割方案、边网格构建策略和节点特征集（包括颜色、纹理和形状描述符），在皮肤镜图像上进行广泛实验，测试了无监督、弱监督和全监督三种模式。

Result: 颜色描述符单独性能最佳，组合形状和纹理特征持续提升检测效果。最佳无监督配置达到AUC-ROC 0.805，弱监督提升到0.872，全监督达到0.914。

Conclusion: 这项研究为图像到图象转换方法的选择提供了系统性指南，表明适当的特征组合和转换策略可以在不依赖预训练模型的情况下实现竞争性能的图级异常检测。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived
graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or
anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting
features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness
of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for
GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we
systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge
construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and
shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to
perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on
dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance
and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised
regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute
the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features
consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised
configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805
without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.
With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to
0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks
for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary
tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that
exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage
- colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial
content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and
without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive
experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a
variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and
transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and
synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on
downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for
applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic
systems.

Motivation: 多模态模型在空间理解和推理方面仍有显著局限性，而GPT-5作为最新发布的最强大AI模型，需要系统评估其在空间智能方面的进展

Method: 提出了统一的空间任务分类法，并在8个关键测试集上评估了现有最先进的专有和开源模型，消耗超过1亿次token，进行了定性评估

Result: GPT-5在空间智能方面显示出前所未有的强大能力，但在广泛任务中仍落后于人类表现；专有模型在最困难问题上并无决定性优势；识别出了多模态模型的关键挑战问题

Conclusion: 多模态模型在空间智能方面仍有重大空白，GPT-5代表了重要进步但未完全超越人类，专有模型在极端情况下不一定优于开源模型，需要进一步研究解决空间理解的核心挑战

Abstract: Multi-modal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years.
Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial
understanding and reasoning, which are fundamental capabilities to achieving
artificial general intelligence. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly
the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading
models stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. First, we propose a
comprehensive taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and
discuss the challenges in ensuring fair evaluation. We then evaluate
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models on eight key benchmarks, at
a cost exceeding one billion total tokens. Our empirical study reveals that (1)
GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence, yet (2)
still falls short of human performance across a broad spectrum of tasks.
Moreover, we (3) identify the more challenging spatial intelligence problems
for multi-modal models, and (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive
advantage when facing the most difficult problems. In addition, we conduct a
qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for
humans yet fail even the most advanced multi-modal models.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了医学影像基础模型在图像质量变化下的标签效率，发现图像质量分布及其在微调与测试集之间的不匹配显著影响模型性能，强调了在特定下游任务中量化和对齐图像质量分布的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型在标签效率方面显示出潜力，但图像质量变化如何影响其微调效果尚不清楚。本研究旨在系统评估前列腺多参数MRI中图像质量分布对领域特定视觉基础模型微调性能的影响。

Method: 使用ProFound（基于大规模前列腺MRI数据集预训练的领域特定视觉基础模型），通过系统变化微调和评估集中的高/低质量图像比例，测量微调模型的泛化能力。

Result: 研究发现：a) 微调集和测试集之间高/低质量图像比例的变化会导致下游性能显著差异；b) 微调集中足够高质量图像对保持强性能至关重要；c) 当质量比例一致时，微调所需标注数据远少于从头训练，但标签效率取决于图像质量分布。

Conclusion: 图像质量分布及其在微调与部署环境之间的匹配程度对基础模型的性能至关重要。缺乏足够高质量微调数据时，预训练模型可能无法超越无预训练的模型，强调了在特定下游任务中建立微调数据质量标准的必要性。

Abstract: Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency,
achieving high downstream performance with only a fraction of annotated data.
Here, we evaluate this in prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a
domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI
datasets. We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient
finetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments
systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation
sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its
finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In
particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between
finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream
performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the
finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the
importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between
different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate
cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less
labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image
quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained
models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This
highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions
between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in
finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the
value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully
realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaRing是一个基于跨层张量环分解的视觉语言微调框架，通过整合多样化适配器实现超轻量参数高效适配，在减少90%训练参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器方法存在两个主要局限：1)由于忽略跨层冗余导致的压缩率有限，2)同质适配器的表示能力有限。需要解决跨层冗余问题并提升适配器的表示能力。

Method: 利用张量级低秩性将适配器表示为层共享的张量核和层特定切片，通过泛化感知微调指导多样化秩驱动适配器协作处理不同表示需求的任务。

Result: 实验表明AdaRing在减少平均训练参数90%的情况下实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的跨层张量环分解框架有效解决了适配器冗余问题，通过多样化适配器协作实现了参数高效的高性能视觉语言模型适配。

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large
pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks
efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,
without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale
adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity
of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited
compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited
representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer
tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of
diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient
adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists
among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to
formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.
Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven
adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our
experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art
performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EVTP-IV的视觉token剪枝方法，通过选择空间代表性强的token子集来加速指令视觉分割任务，在保持精度的同时实现3.5-5倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在指令视觉分割任务中推理成本过高，特别是在视频处理时成为主要瓶颈。研究发现视觉token子集覆盖度与分割性能强相关。

Method: 基于k-center算法整合空间信息来选择紧凑但空间代表性的token子集，确保更好的覆盖度，并提供信息论分析支持设计。

Result: 在标准IVS基准测试中，使用仅20%的token实现了视频任务5倍加速和图像任务3.5倍加速，同时保持可比精度，且在不同剪枝比例下始终优于最先进的剪枝基线。

Conclusion: EVTP-IV是一种简单有效的视觉token剪枝方法，能够显著加速指令视觉分割任务的推理过程，同时保持性能，为解决MLLMs推理成本问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in
images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We
empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong
correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This
motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that
selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate
inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for
IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial
information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an
information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard
IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks
and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%
of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

*Quanwei Hu,Yinggan Tang,Xuguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于纯CNN的大核调制网络（LKMN），通过增强部分大核块和交叉门控前馈网络，在轻量级图像超分辨率任务中平衡性能与推理速度，超越现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决资源受限场景下图像超分辨率的需求：CNN模型推理快但缺乏非局部特征捕获能力，Transformer擅长非局部建模但推理速度慢。需要平衡性能与延迟的轻量级模型。

Method: 提出LKMN模型，包含两个核心组件：1）增强部分大核块（EPLKB）- 使用通道混洗增强通道交互，通道注意力关注关键信息，部分通道应用大核条带卷积进行非局部特征提取；2）交叉门控前馈网络（CGFN）- 通过可学习缩放因子动态调整输入、局部和非局部特征的差异，采用交叉门控策略调制融合特征。

Result: 在Manga109数据集×4超分辨率任务上，LKMN-L比DAT-light提升0.23dB PSNR，推理速度快约4.8倍，在质量和效率之间取得更好平衡。

Conclusion: LKMN证明了纯CNN架构可以通过创新的模块设计实现非局部特征捕获，在轻量级超分辨率任务中达到优于Transformer的性能，同时保持CNN的高效推理优势。

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands
lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while
Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address
this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure
CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel
Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes
channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel
attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip
convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced
complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,
and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a
cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their
complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality
and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over
DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8
times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials. The code is available
at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKMN.

TL;DR: 重新考察Sobel算子，仅使用水平和垂直边缘演算子作为输入，训练全密层MLP网络在手写字符识别任务上达到了接近CNN的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一阶导数边缘映射是否足以驱动全密层MLP进行手写字符识别，作为卷积神经网络的替代方案

Method: 仅使用水平和垂直Sobel导数作为输入，在MNIST和EMNIST Letters数据集上训练全密层MLP网络

Result: 在MNIST数字上达到98%准确率，在EMNIST字母上达到92%准确率，性能接近CNN但占用更少内存并具有透明的特征表示

Conclusion: 手写字符图像中的类别区分信息已经被一阶梯度抓取，边缘感知MLP成为手写字符识别的一个简洁而有效的选择

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are
first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron
(MLP) for handwritten character recognition (HCR), as an alternative to
convolutional neural networks (CNNs)? Using only horizontal and vertical Sobel
derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its
extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits
and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory
footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the
class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already
captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option
for HCR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频基准任务在流式视频和使用视觉符号的查询时遇到困难，需要一种能够处理混合多模态查询的在线方案。

Method: 提出OVG-HQ-Unify统一框架，包含参数化记忆块(PMB)保留历史知识提升决策，以及跨模态荟蓬策略平衡不同模态的学习。构建QVHighlights-Unify多模态数据集，并推出在线评估指标。

Result: 实验结果显示OVG-HQ-Unify在新的在线混合模态视频基准任务上表现超过现有模型，提供了稳健的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开连了在线混合模态视频基准的新任务，通过创新的框架设计有效解决了在线设置下的上下文限制和模态不平衡问题，为该领域的研究提供了基础性贡献。

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video
based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with
some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this
gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal
Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,
video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:
limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,
where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose
OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)
that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a
cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant
modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle
hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct
QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides,
since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the
online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision
(omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our
OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for
online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Source code and datasets are available at
https://github.com/maojiaqi2324/OVG-HQ.

*Lingyun Zhang,Yu Xie,Yanwei Fu,Ping Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SafeCtrl，一种轻量级的检测-压制方案，用于防止文本到图像模型生成有害内容，在保持安全性的同时维持了图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全方法（如提示重写或模型微调）存在安全性与保真度之间的批执，而基于概念替换的定位方法可能导致语义不协调。

Method: 提出SafeCtrl插件，先精确定位不安全内容，然后压制有害语义而非硬替换，让生成过程自然解决为安全适配。使用DPO训练策略，利用图像级偏好数据训练模块。

Result: 实验结果显示SafeCtrl在安全效果和保真度保持方面都显著超过了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 解耦合的压制基于控制是一种高效且可扩展的方向，可以建设更负责任的生成模型。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their
potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as
prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they
often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent
localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on
explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To
address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress
paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first
precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B
substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the
generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,
context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training
strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily
available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to
learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at
inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive
experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest
that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable
direction for building more responsible generative models.

TL;DR: TimeSenCLIP是一个轻量级框架，利用单像素的时序和光谱信息进行土地利用分类，减少了对大空间瓦片和文本监督的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在遥感应用中面临两个关键挑战：依赖大空间瓦片增加计算成本，以及依赖文本监督但文本数据往往不易获得。

Method: 利用Sentinel-2影像的光谱和时序信息，通过与地理标记的地面照片进行跨视角学习，最小化基于标题的训练需求，同时保持卫星和地面视角之间的语义对齐。

Result: 研究表明，单像素输入结合时序和光谱线索足以进行专题制图，为大规模遥感应用提供了可扩展且高效的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法在LULC、作物类型和生态系统类型分类任务中表现良好，证明了单像素时序光谱信息在遥感分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-language models have shown significant promise in remote sensing
applications, particularly for land-use and land-cover (LULC) via zero-shot
classification and retrieval. However, current approaches face two key
challenges: reliance on large spatial tiles that increase computational cost,
and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.
In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate
the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel
by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and
ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from
Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,
we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic
alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is
grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification
tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single
pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for
thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale
remote sensing applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤手动分割面临肿瘤异质性、标注数据稀缺和类别不平衡等挑战，合成数据有潜力通过增加数据集多样性来缓解这些问题。

Method: 使用预训练GAN模型生成合成MRI数据，结合BraTS 2020真实数据，构建不同比例的混合数据集训练U-Net分割网络，评估分割性能。

Result: 混合训练模型与纯真实数据训练模型在定量指标上表现相当，但40%真实+60%合成数据的混合数据集在肿瘤边界分割方面有定性改善，肿瘤核心区域精度仍较低。

Conclusion: 合成数据作为脑肿瘤分割的数据增强策略是可行的，但需要更大规模实验、保持体积数据一致性并解决类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor
heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical
imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the
potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study
investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI
data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net
segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS
2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid
datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While
overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall,
accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models,
qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40%
real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation.
However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor
remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support
the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor
segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments,
volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across
varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is
essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep
learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation
capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in
denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in
performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments
of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges
in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and
proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we
formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise
restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally,
we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective
advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions,
offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

Motivation: 现有方法主要适用于静态或准静态场景，在相机和物体同时快速移动时性能显著下降，需要解决快速运动场景下的6D姿态跟踪鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出三个协同组件：1）视觉惯性里程计补偿相机运动引起的ROI偏移；2）深度感知2D跟踪器校正大物体平移引起的ROI偏差；3）VIO引导的卡尔曼滤波器预测物体旋转并生成候选姿态，通过分层细化获得最终姿态。

Conclusion: DynamicPose形成了一个闭环系统，确保准确的姿态初始化和精确的姿态跟踪，在快速运动场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that
improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios.
Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its
performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move
rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components:
(1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of
Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker
corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided
Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and
then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking
results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a
closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving
cameras and objects.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable
features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are
critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature
learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware
layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be
conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This
paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood
based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive
diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature
embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as
transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this
paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization
to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization.
Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

Conclusion: UniUGG成功实现了3D理解和生成的统一框架，通过几何语义学习和潜在扩散模型的结合，显著提升了3D任务的性能表现。

Abstract: Despite the impressive progress on understanding and generating images shown
by the recent unified architectures, the integration of 3D tasks remains
challenging and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce UniUGG, the
first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our
unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D
representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent
diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for
the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an
arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual
question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic
learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures
the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding
and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation.
The source code will be released upon paper acceptance.

TL;DR: SAMDWICH是一个针对视频指代分割任务的新框架，通过引入时间标注和选择性监督来解决语义对齐问题，在MeViS基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频指代分割方法存在语义错位问题，主要原因是训练时对所有可见对象进行无差别采样和监督，而不考虑它们与文本查询的实际相关性。

Method: 提出了SAMDWICH框架，包含：1）新标注的MeViS-M数据集，手动标注每个对象被表达式引用的时间片段；2）时刻引导的双路径传播（MDP）策略，通过时刻中心记忆机制在相关和不相关帧上进行训练；3）对象级选择性监督（OSS），只监督与表达式时间对齐的对象。

Result: 在具有挑战性的MeViS基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在涉及多样化表达式的复杂场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: 通过引入时间对齐的监督和选择性训练策略，SAMDWICH显著提高了视频-文本对齐质量，有效解决了语义错位问题，为视频指代分割任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects
in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment
between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often
suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling
and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their
actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a
moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated
dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually
annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the
expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens
video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to
guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building
upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a
moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and
tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a
moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level
Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises
only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.
This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces
language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark,
particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘检测在计算机视觉中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法计算成本高，难以在资源受限设备上部署。需要平衡高精度与低计算复杂度。

Method: 提出PEdger++协作学习框架，利用异构架构、多样训练时刻和多重参数采样的跨信息，从集成学习角度增强特征学习能力。

Conclusion: PEdger++成功实现了边缘检测精度与计算效率的良好平衡，具有适应不同资源约束的灵活性，为边缘检测的实际部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision
applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries
and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with
varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy
with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved
accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their
applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture
discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated
models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to
reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection
accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived
from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple
parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble
perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also
provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,
highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource
constraints. Codes are accessible at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个新的多分辨率多模态微表情数据集，利用事件相机和RGB相机同步采集，在变化光照条件下记录微表情。基础实验显示事件数据在动作单元分类和帧重建任务上都较RGB数据更优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情分析在人机交互和驾驶监测等领域有重要应用，但依靠RGB相机很难准确捕捉细微快速的面部运动，因为时间分辨率有限且容易出现运动模糊。事件相机具有微秒级精度、高动态范围和低延迟的优势，但相关公开数据集仍然稀缺。

Method: 研究人员创建了一个新的多分辨率多模态微表情数据集，使用同步的RGB和事件相机在变化光照条件下进行记录。评估了两个基础任务：使用疯粉神经网络进行动作单元分类，以及使用条件变分自动编码器进行帧重建。

Result: 在动作单元分类任务中，使用事件数据的准确率达到51.23%，而RGB数据仅为23.12%。在帧重建任务中，使用高分辨率事件输入得到了SSIM=0.8513和PSNR=26.89 dB的结果。

Conclusion: 这些有前景的结果表明，事件基数据可以用于微表情识别和帧重建，为微表情分析领域提供了一个有效的新方法。

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot
Interaction and Driver Monitoring Systems. Accurately capturing subtle and fast
facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to
limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event
cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic
range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based
recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a
novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset
recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting
conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal
dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural
Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame
reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =
0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising
results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition
and frame reconstruction.

Conclusion: MOON作为首个基于生成式MLLM的产品表示学习模型，成功解决了产品理解中的关键挑战，为电子商务领域的产品表示学习提供了新的有效解决方案，并通过新基准推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations
rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For
product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures
drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one
alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue
that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant
potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:
the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the
common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a
standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the
first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation
learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for
targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)
effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the
distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the
specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity
of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark
MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model
demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the
public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute
prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the
effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Conclusion: InstDrive成功解决了动态驾驶场景中实例感知重建的挑战，为自动驾驶和场景理解提供了有效的实例级3D表示方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted
increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene
understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most
methods still unify all background elements into a single representation,
hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some
approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on
pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to
discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor
scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving
scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic
driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D
feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the
3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities
and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static
codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without
requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance
segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动化方法在B模式图像中直接预测标记点时，即使沿左室壁的小偏移也可能导致显著测量误差，影响临床可靠性。需要一种更稳健和准确的全自动测量方法。

Method: 提出了边界意识扫描线安置方法，通过弱监督B模式标记点检测器估计左室边界，然后推断左室长轴和基底水平来安置扫描线。基于此，构建了WiseLVAM框架，利用B模式的结构意识和AMM模式的运动意识来提高稳健性和准确性。

Result: WiseLVAM框架能够全自动地安置扫描线并在AMM模式下进行左室线性测量，同时保持人工调整的灵活性。该方法提高了测量的准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: WiseLVAM为左室线性测量提供了一种实用的全自动化解决方案，具有强大的临床应用潜力，能够在常规临床工作中提供更稳健和准确的测量结果。

Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear
measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically
at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long
axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate
landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even
small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant
measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent
semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining
landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated
Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To
enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in
this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised
B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV
long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this
foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet
manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then
automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.
\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the
motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the
potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Result: 在VQA-RAD数据集上表现超过之前模型，尤其在需要图像-文本推理的复杂案例中优势显著

Conclusion: 频域与量子信息的结合为建立智能、明确和有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的方法

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion

face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated
data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D
motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While
video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1)
developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that
distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error
propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion
Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer,
enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results
show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more
efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world
applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this
limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for
object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR),
which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional
detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates
detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the
spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability
of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a
more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying
image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that
PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods,
and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance.

Conclusion: 扩散模型为通用事件边界检测提供了有效的生成式解决方案，能够处理边界标注的主观多样性问题，并通过新评估指标验证了预测质量。

Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries
in a video, segmenting it into distinct and meaningful chunks. Despite the
inherent subjectivity of event boundaries, previous methods have focused on
deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,
dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative
perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames
via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into
plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.
Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in
denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.
Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard
benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event
boundaries.

Abstract: We propose a multi-stage convolutional neural network (MSCNN) based
integrated method for reducing uncertainty of 3D point accuracy of lasar
scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial
measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to
different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end
LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as
references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in
identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a
statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial
distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional
geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method
transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning
problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric
features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show
significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE)
reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of
approximately 6 decibels. This approach enables low-end devices to achieve
measurement uncertainty levels approaching those of high-end devices without
hardware modifications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing
unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their
large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive
iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ)
provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature
of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate
progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To
address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically
formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step
quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form
solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive
experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation
strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing
existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on
low-precision diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the
medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain.
However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text,
curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities
such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This
difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework,
termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric
data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on
large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective
pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1)
We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are
often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language
encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual
semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture
multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report
pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships
embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives,
thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The
resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation,
cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

*Ye Wang,Qianglong Chen,Zejun Li,Siyuan Wang,Shijie Guo,Zhirui Zhang,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Simple o3是一个端到端的多模态推理框架，通过动态视觉工具交互和监督微调，在多种基准测试中表现出色，建立了计算高效的多模态推理新范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现优异，但在多模态场景下的长链思维推理能力尚未充分探索，需要开发能够模拟人类"图像思维"的迭代视觉转换和语言推理方法。

Method: 提出了Simple o3端到端框架，通过监督微调整合动态工具交互（裁剪、缩放、重用），采用"观察-推理-行动"循环的数据合成管道生成高质量的交织视觉语言推理链，并创建了TWI-Tools-146K数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明Simple o3在多样化基准测试中表现卓越，优于现有方法。通过引入额外的视觉标记进行交织推理，重用和放大原始图像显著提升了模型的视觉推理和细粒度感知能力。

Conclusion: Simple o3结合增强的推理能力，建立了一个强大且计算成本合理的多模态推理范式，首次深入分析了不同交织推理策略对模型性能的影响，为多模态推理的发展提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on
vision-language tasks, but their long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capabilities in
multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which
emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual
transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end
framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,
and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline
that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an
''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and
rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse
benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning
capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable
paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first
in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering
insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing
additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and
magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual
reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise
visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or
regions, further enhancing its capabilities.

*Minh Tran,Johnmark Clements,Annie Prasanna,Tri Nguyen,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFit是一个两阶段虚拟试穿方法，通过变形和保真度合成来保持服装细节，解决了现有方法无法保留logo和印刷文本的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的免变形虚拟试穿方法虽然提升了感知质量，但无法保持服装的精细细节（如logo和印刷文本），这对品牌完整性和客户信任至关重要

Method: 采用两阶段混合方法：第一阶段通过学习的流场将目标服装变形对齐到人物图像；第二阶段通过保真度试穿模块将变形后的服装与保留的人体区域进行融合，使用保留区域输入和修复掩码来指导过程

Result: 广泛的定性结果显示DualFit实现了视觉上无缝的试穿效果，同时忠实地保持了高频服装细节，在重建准确性和感知真实性之间取得了有效平衡

Conclusion: DualFit通过混合方法成功解决了虚拟试穿中细节保持的问题，为在线时尚零售提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its
potential to transform the online fashion retail experience by allowing users
to visualize how garments would look on them without physical trials. While
recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved
perceptual quality, they often fail to preserve fine-grained garment details
such as logos and printed text elements that are critical for brand integrity
and customer trust. In this work, we propose DualFit, a hybrid VTON pipeline
that addresses this limitation by two-stage approach. In the first stage,
DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned
flow field, ensuring high-fidelity preservation. In the second stage, a
fidelity-preserving try-on module synthesizes the final output by blending the
warped garment with preserved human regions. Particularly, to guide this
process, we introduce a preserved-region input and an inpainting mask, enabling
the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly
around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves
visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency
garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy
and perceptual realism.

### [179] [TriQDef: Disrupting Semantic and Gradient Alignment to Prevent Adversarial Patch Transferability in Quantized Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12132)
*Amira Guesmi,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriQDef是一个三层次量化感知防御框架，通过特征不对齐惩罚和梯度感知失调惩罚来破坏跨位宽补丁对抗攻击的可迁移性，在保持高清洁精度的同时将攻击成功率降低40%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络(QNNs)虽然在计算和内存使用上高效，但对基于补丁的对抗攻击（局部高显著性扰动）的鲁棒性有限，现有防御要么过拟合固定量化设置，要么无法解决跨位宽泛化漏洞。

Method: TriQDef包含三个层次：1)特征不对齐惩罚(FDP)通过惩罚中间表示的感知相似性来强制语义不一致；2)梯度感知失调惩罚(GPDP)通过Edge IoU和HOG Cosine度量最小化结构性和方向性一致性来显式错位输入梯度；3)联合量化感知训练协议，在多个量化级别上统一这些惩罚。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TriQDef在未见过的补丁和量化组合上将攻击成功率(ASR)降低了40%以上，同时保持了高清洁精度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了破坏语义和感知梯度对齐对于减轻QNNs中补丁可迁移性的重要性，TriQDef框架有效解决了跨位宽补丁攻击的转移性问题。

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and
resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and
memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken
conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against
patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that
remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either
overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit
generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level
quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of
patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature
Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing
perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient
Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients
across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge
IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training
Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme
across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over
40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean
accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic
and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Motivation: 解决大规模对比预训练VLMs在细粒度开放集检索任务中表现次优的问题，避免传统细调方法导致的灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 受持续学习文献启发，系统分析标准正则化技术，提出高效组合策略，并关注验证集设计和超参数调整。

Result: 在细粒度和粗粒度图像-图像、图像-文本检索测试中一致获得强劲结果，在不使用文本数据的情况下保持了视觉-文本对齐能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效平衡预训练知识保留与领域适配，为VLMs的细调提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for
a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained
embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where
state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated
domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to
catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose
visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve
optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the
pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual
learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization
techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective
combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet
critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained
models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and
coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach
consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text
alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during
fine-tuning. Code and model checkpoints: https://github.com/nikosips/infusing .

Motivation: 现有INR方法主要关注基于坐标的位置嵌入，但忽略了目标点及其邻域上下文特征表示的重要性，这限制了心脏电影MRI重建的质量。

Method: 提出KP-INR双分支方法：一个分支处理k空间坐标的位置嵌入，另一个分支学习坐标处的局部多尺度k空间特征表示，并通过跨分支交互来近似目标k空间值。

Result: 在CMRxRecon2024数据集上的实验证实，KP-INR相比基线模型具有改进的性能，在具有挑战性的笛卡尔k空间数据上表现出色。

Conclusion: KP-INR通过结合位置嵌入和局部特征表示的双分支方法，在心脏电影MRI重建领域展现出巨大潜力，为快速采集技术提供了高质量图像恢复方案。

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for
assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by
capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To
reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have
been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural
Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction
by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling
high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily
focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,
while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its
neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method
operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes
the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from
local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By
enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values
from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging
Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its
improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this
field.

Motivation: 现有的记忆检测方法无法量化小图像区域的部分记忆，也无法捕捉超越特定提示-图像对的记忆模式。

Method: 提出FB-Mem方法，使用分割技术对生成图像中的记忆区域进行分类和量化分析。

Result: 发现：(1)单个提示可能与多个训练图像相关联，显示复杂的记忆模式；(2)现有减缓方法无法消除局部记忆，特别是前景区域。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个有效的记忆测量框架，证明了现有减缓方法的不足，并提出了基于聚类的更强劲减缓方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce
near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim
memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial
memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond
specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric
that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our
method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:
(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of
similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend
beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation
methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local
memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work
establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion
models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and
proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However,
while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they
often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while
preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce
RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high
emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity
preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D
facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label
embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce
emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly
condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to
synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy,
controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of
socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding,
enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP)
onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally
assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the
inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and
feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear
inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach
admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses
for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and
noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization
strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov
Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while
Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based,
grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted

Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution
modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional
ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a
generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with
physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning
a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of
cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the
efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative
imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic
properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data
(breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten
minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and
resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in
strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine
clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

Conclusion: 这项工作为天气噪声环境下的SOD研究提供了重要的数据集基础和基线方法，对推动该领域的进一步发展具有重要意义。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging
research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with
negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and
infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the
damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with
pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel
Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of
14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding
ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm
generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and
a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean
images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we
propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network
(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.
Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep
features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted
from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons
against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on
WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于超像素的连续低秩张量表示框架(SCTR)，解决传统低秩张量方法在实际应用中的两大限制：整体数据低秩假设不合理和仅限于网格数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩张量表示方法假设整体数据低秩，但实际场景中空间变化很大，这个假设常被违背；同时仅能处理离散网格数据，灵活性和适用性受限。

Method: 提出SCTR框架：(1)使用超像素作为基本建模单元，因为语义一致区域具有更强的低秩特性；(2)提出非对称低秩张量分解(ALTF)，通过共享神经网络与专门头部来参数化超像素特定因子矩阵，分离全局模式学习和局部适应。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行的广泛实验显示，SCTR在多谱图像、视频和色彩图像上，比现有的基于低秩张量表示的方法提高了3-5 dB的PSNR。

Conclusion: SCTR框架能够连续且灵活地建模多维数据，突破传统网格限制，通过超像素单元和非对称分解技术，有效捐捕了跨超像素的共性和超像素内的变化，实现了高表达力与简洁性的平衡。

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for
multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face
two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is
low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with
significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete
meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor
Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling
of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our
approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation
that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics
than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This
design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances
adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel
asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific
factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized
heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local
adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel
commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation
that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with
adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods
across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for
action-to-video generation of complex high-DoF interactions while maintaining
transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation
faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive
actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while
agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain
transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we
propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic
representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain
adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for
their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct
skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions
(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of
action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into
pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable
precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of
cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Project page:

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the
ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more
context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as
Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this
limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond
to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information
of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose
Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which
incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to
utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual
content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we
introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset
that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal
personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free
evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the
region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL
models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental
results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding
performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications
in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark
are available at https://github.com/hongliang-wei/RC-MLLM

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations,
offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them
well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration.
In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network
for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven
paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary
spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on
operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are
incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed
SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and
hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of
binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic
Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual
learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)
module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication
and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.
Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further
improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature
interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive
experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak
removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while
significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the
potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be
available after the article is accepted.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with
varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational
limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when
deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network
according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving
hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control
mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel --
allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware
constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model
scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific
optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and
performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to
efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets.
Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through
automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity
and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate
Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in
alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA
customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing
hardware utilization.

Abstract: The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate
pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot
Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we
therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with
noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this
end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score
from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we
design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images
into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to
alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping
function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image
features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image
features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization
ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of
learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,
Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR
consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: 该研究通过系统性的密度化流程改进，有效解决了3D高斯散点在重建质量方面的限制，为实时渲染领域提供了更优雅的解决方案

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has achieved impressive performance in
real-time rendering, its densification strategy often results in suboptimal
reconstruction quality. In this work, we present a comprehensive improvement to
the densification pipeline of 3DGS from three perspectives: when to densify,
how to densify, and how to mitigate overfitting. Specifically, we propose an
Edge-Aware Score to effectively select candidate Gaussians for splitting. We
further introduce a Long-Axis Split strategy that reduces geometric distortions
introduced by clone and split operations. To address overfitting, we design a
set of techniques, including Recovery-Aware Pruning, Multi-step Update, and
Growth Control. Our method enhances rendering fidelity without introducing
additional training or inference overhead, achieving state-of-the-art
performance with fewer Gaussians.

Result: 在三个白血球显微镜数据集上评估，NCA-WSS显著超过现有弱监督方法

Conclusion: 证明了NCA在弱监督框架下既能分类又能分割的潜力，为医学图像分析提供了可扩展和高效的解决方案

Abstract: The detection and segmentation of white blood cells in blood smear images is
a key step in medical diagnostics, supporting various downstream tasks such as
automated blood cell counting, morphological analysis, cell classification, and
disease diagnosis and monitoring. Training robust and accurate models requires
large amounts of labeled data, which is both time-consuming and expensive to
acquire. In this work, we propose a novel approach for weakly supervised
segmentation using neural cellular automata (NCA-WSS). By leveraging the
feature maps generated by NCA during classification, we can extract
segmentation masks without the need for retraining with segmentation labels. We
evaluate our method on three white blood cell microscopy datasets and
demonstrate that NCA-WSS significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised
approaches. Our work illustrates the potential of NCA for both classification
and segmentation in a weakly supervised framework, providing a scalable and
efficient solution for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 基于NCA的模型具有作为可解释图像分类替代方案的潜力，注意力池化的集成有效提升了性能

Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) offer a robust and interpretable approach to
image classification, making them a promising choice for microscopy image
analysis. However, a performance gap remains between NCA and larger, more
complex architectures. We address this challenge by integrating attention
pooling with NCA to enhance feature extraction and improve classification
accuracy. The attention pooling mechanism refines the focus on the most
informative regions, leading to more accurate predictions. We evaluate our
method on eight diverse microscopy image datasets and demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing NCA methods while remaining

Conclusion: DoppDrive通过多普勒驱动的智能时间聚合，有效解决了雷达点云稀疏和动态散射问题，为雷达目标检测提供了通用的性能提升方案

Abstract: Radar-based object detection is essential for autonomous driving due to
radar's long detection range. However, the sparsity of radar point clouds,
especially at long range, poses challenges for accurate detection. Existing
methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion
compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects,
degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven
temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while
minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according
to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point
assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to
minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement
step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate
that it significantly improves object detection performance across various
detectors and datasets.

Motivation: 头成显示器(HMDs)遮挡了用户面部上半部分，影响视频记录和社交XR应用，特别是需要面部表情和眼神交流的情境

Method: 整合GAN基础的视频修复网络，通过密集面部关键点和单张无遮挡参照帧指导，恢复缺失面部区域保持身份识别。然后使用SynergyNet基础模块从修复后的帧中回归3DMM参数，实现3D面部重建

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种高效的解决方案，能够在保持面部身份识别的前提下去除HMD遮挡，为社交XR应用提供了重要技术支撑

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality
(XR) environments and observing virtual content. However, they obscure the
upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and
significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where
facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive
experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to
jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from
RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based
video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single
occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while
preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate
3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout
the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the
recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining
facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.
Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across
different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse
landmark configurations.

Conclusion: 所提出的SDD方法通过空间对齐和概念引导的差异学习，有效提升了伪造图像检测的性能

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery
detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of
digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of
pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the
misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the
model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction
learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting
the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we
specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space
shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic
concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a
visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction
between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing
discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery
feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies
to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two
standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD,
which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/wzy1111111/SSD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba架构在图像去模糊中存在局部像素遗忘和频道冗余问题，而现有方法通过修改扫描策略或添加局部特征模块来缓解，但这会增加计算复杂度影响实时性能

Method: 设计内存缓冲机制保存历史信息以便后期融合，并引入Ising灵感的正则化损失，模拟物理系统能量最小化的"相互吸引"机制，维护图像结构一致性

Result: 在广泛使用的测试集上超越了目前最先进的方法

Conclusion: MBMamba在不改变原有Mamba架构的情况下，通过内存缓冲和物理灵感正则化有效解决了局部信息遗失问题，实现了更好的图像去模糊效果

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and
Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often
results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability
to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods
mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature
modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.
In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without
changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory
buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling
reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we
introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy
minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels,
helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop
MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on widely used benchmarks.

the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is
crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic
motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction
localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,
but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although
current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting
verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training
and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation
moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed
EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric
videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate
high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify
contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide
closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for
object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot
implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel
benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric
videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream
applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and
relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

*Ahmet H. Güzel,Ilija Bogunovic,Jack Parker-Holder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过生成合成训练数据来改善视觉基于离线强化学习的绝继性能，使用扩增和潜空间激光模型生成更多样本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线RL策略在视觉数据上遇到绝继困难，因为限制的数据多样性导致过拟合和模型偏偏，需要更多多样化的训练数据来提升演进性能

Method: 两步过程：首先对原始离线数据进行扩增增加多样性，然后使用激光模型在潜空间生成额外的合成数据

Result: 在连续动作空间(Visual D4RL)和离散动作空间(Procgen)上都显著提升了绝继性能，减小了测试时的绝继差距，同时保持计算效率

Conclusion: 该方法不需要改变现有离线RL算法就能提升性能，为使用合成数据训练更具演进性的代理提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training
agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment
interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to
generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual
data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious
correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of
overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this
makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust
agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we
propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We
propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline
data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a
diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method
across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces
(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without
requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We
show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but
also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while
maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel
additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents
in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了IPGPhormer框架，通过图-Transformer结构同时捕获肿瘤微环境特征和空间依赖关系，在生存分析中实现了更好的预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡长距离空间关系建模与局部上下文依赖方面存在困难，且缺乏内在可解释性，限制了临床实用性

Method: 使用Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer)框架，在组织和细胞层面提供可解释性，无需后处理人工标注

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上的综合评估表明，IPGPhormer在预测准确性和可解释性方面均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: IPGPhormer为癌症预后评估提供了一个有前景的工具，为病理学中更可靠和可解释的决策支持系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while
survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict
critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning
have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,
existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial
relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,
we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel
framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and
models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely
provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring
post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and
cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark
datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,
IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the
way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViT-EnsembleAttack方法，通过对抗性增强ViT模型来提升集成攻击的迁移性，包含多头丢弃、注意力分数缩放和MLP特征混合三种策略，并使用贝叶斯优化优化参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击研究主要关注优化集成权重或路径，忽视了通过增强集成模型本身来提升对抗迁移性，特别是ViT模型的集成攻击研究较少。

Method: 为每个ViT代理模型应用对抗性增强：1）多头丢弃 2）注意力分数缩放 3）MLP特征混合，使用贝叶斯优化参数，并引入自动重加权和步长放大模块。

Result: 实验表明ViT-EnsembleAttack显著提升了ViT集成攻击的对抗迁移性，大幅优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过对抗性增强ViT模型可以有效提升集成攻击的迁移性，为ViT模型的对抗攻击提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing
adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various
architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining
ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration
of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To
address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate
models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce
the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision
Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on
the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack
method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates
augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head
dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated
parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented
models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we
introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost
transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack
significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based
attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Code

*Xiaochuan Lin,Xiangyong Chen,Xuan Li,Yichen Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCoT是一个通过大语言模型分解复杂文本指令来提升文生图模型性能的框架，在LongBench-T2I基准测试中显著改善了文本渲染和构图准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文生图模型在处理复杂长文本指令时存在困难，经常无法准确渲染细节、空间关系和特定约束，需要更好的方法来理解和执行复杂指令。

Method: DeCoT框架包含两个核心阶段：1）复杂指令分解和语义增强，使用LLM将原始指令分解为结构化语义单元；2）多阶段提示集成和自适应生成，将这些单元转换为适合现有T2I模型的分层或优化提示。

Result: 在LongBench-T2I数据集上，DeCoT显著提升了主流T2I模型的性能，特别是在"文本"和"构图"等挑战性维度。与Infinity-8B集成时平均得分3.52，优于基线3.44。人类评估也证实了感知质量和指令保真度的提升。

Conclusion: DeCoT有效弥合了高级用户意图与T2I模型需求之间的差距，实现了更忠实和准确的图像生成，证明了LLM在增强T2I模型复杂指令理解能力方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle
with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately
render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This
limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal
deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To
address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'
understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core
stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,
where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic
units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and
Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or
optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments
on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and
substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all
evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and
"Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators
(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with
Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline
Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each
DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,
human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual
quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between
high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and
accurate image generation.

TL;DR: FedCSAP是一个联邦学习框架，利用CLIP模型的多尺度视觉特征和客户端特定风格统计，生成上下文感知的提示词，在保护数据隐私的同时提升分类准确性和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习方法仅使用最终层特征，忽略了丰富的多尺度视觉线索和客户端特定的风格变化，限制了模型在非IID数据分布下的性能

Method: 从CLIP视觉编码器提取低、中、高三个层次的特征，结合客户端批处理统计生成风格指示器，将视觉细节与文本上下文融合生成鲁棒的提示词

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedCSAP在准确性和泛化能力方面优于现有的联邦提示学习方法

Conclusion: FedCSAP通过有效利用多尺度视觉特征和客户端风格信息，在联邦学习框架下实现了更好的跨模态表示学习和分类性能

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in
diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational
efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer
features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style
variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework
harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder
alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics.
By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces
robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant,
thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating
within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through
local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class
distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms
existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall
generalization.

TL;DR: MPCAR是一种无需微调的推理时策略，通过多角度生成描述来增强视觉语言模型的上下文理解能力，在复杂视觉推理任务中显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在需要深度上下文理解、多角度分析或精细细节识别的复杂视觉推理任务中表现有限，主要依赖单次图像编码和提示，难以充分捕捉细微视觉信息

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 从不同角度生成N个多样互补的描述或初步推理路径；2) 智能整合这些描述与原问题构建上下文增强提示；3) 使用增强提示指导最终深度推理和答案生成

Result: 在GQA、VQA-CP v2和ScienceQA等挑战性VQA数据集上的实验显示，MPCAR持续优于基线方法，特别是在需要强上下文理解的任务中取得显著准确率提升，人类评估也确认了生成答案的连贯性和完整性改进

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了利用LVLMs固有生成能力来丰富输入上下文的有效性，从而释放其在复杂多模态任务中的潜在推理能力，无需修改模型参数即可实现性能提升

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep
contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail
recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and
prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.
Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information
can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective
Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy
designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an
LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary
reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are
intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a
comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt
guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.
Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning
of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and
ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms
established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant
accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual
understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and
completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the
importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated
perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent
generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their
latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

Conclusion: LMAD为可解释自动驾驶设立了新标准，完全兼容现有VLM并能无缝集成到规划导向的驾驶系统中。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
scene understanding, enhancing the explainability of driving behaviors and
interactivity with users. Existing methods primarily fine-tune VLMs on on-board
multi-view images and scene reasoning text, but this approach often lacks the
holistic and nuanced scene recognition and powerful spatial awareness required
for autonomous driving, especially in complex situations. To address this gap,
we propose a novel vision-language framework tailored for autonomous driving,
called LMAD. Our framework emulates modern end-to-end driving paradigms by
incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized
structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction
and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which
better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach
is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly
integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on
the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts
the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new
standard in explainable autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS)
analysis by leveraging unlabeled data through pseudo-labeling and consistency
learning. However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and
models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5,
the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,
which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically
underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing
large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that
integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the
RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by
pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive
corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and
object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which
enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.
This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across
diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance
across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised
learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released

Abstract: Liver Cirrhosis plays a critical role in the prognosis of chronic liver
disease. Early detection and timely intervention are critical in significantly
reducing mortality rates. However, the intricate anatomical architecture and
diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection
and characterization of lesions in clinical settings. Existing methods
underutilize the spatial anatomical details in volumetric MRI data, thereby
hindering their clinical effectiveness and explainability. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel Mamba-based network, SRMA-Mamba, designed to
model the spatial relationships within the complex anatomical structures of MRI
volumes. By integrating the Spatial Anatomy-Based Mamba module (SABMamba),
SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and
combines anatomical information from the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes to
construct a global spatial context representation, enabling efficient
volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we
introduce the Spatial Reverse Attention module (SRMA), designed to
progressively refine cirrhotic details in the segmentation map, utilizing both
the coarse segmentation map and hierarchical encoding features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SRMA-Mamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
delivering exceptional performance in 3D pathological liver segmentation. Our

Conclusion: TiP4GEN框架成功解决了动态全景场景生成的挑战，为创建高质量沉浸式虚拟环境提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of VR/AR technologies,
there is a growing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive dynamic
scenes. However, existing generation works predominantly concentrate on the
creation of static scenes or narrow perspective-view dynamic scenes, falling
short of delivering a truly 360-degree immersive experience from any viewpoint.
In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic
panorama scene generation framework that enables fine-grained content control
and synthesizes motion-rich, geometry-consistent panoramic 4D scenes. TiP4GEN
integrates panorama video generation and dynamic scene reconstruction to create
360-degree immersive virtual environments. For video generation, we introduce a
\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a
perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,
respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates
comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene
reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using
metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our
method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually
compelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes. Our project page is at

Method: 通过系统性对比人类和AI对经典视觉幻觉（颜色、大小、形状、运动）的响应，分析幻觉效果的出现机制

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发保持人类有益感知偏见、避免破坏信任和安全的投影偏差的视觉系统提供了重要见解

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of
illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs
visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of
more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)
vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is
based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial
vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:
does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article
explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,
shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these
models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern
recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as
pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By
systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover
alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human
perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision
systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding
distortions that undermine trust and safety.

Motivation: 现有VQA-NLE系统可能产生不一致的解释，并在没有真正理解背景情境的情况下得出结论，曝露了模型推理流程或解释生成机制的弱点。

Method: 不仅利用现有对抗策略干扰问题，还提出了一种新的策略来最小程度改变图像以诱导矛盾或假的输出，并提出了利用外部知识的缓解方法。

Result: 在两个标准测试集和两个广泛使用的VQA-NLE模型上进行了涉及广泛的评估，证明了攻击的有效性和知识基防御的潜力。

Conclusion: 强调了当前VQA-NLE系统在安全性和可靠性方面的紧迫问题，显示了知识基防御方法的潜力。

Abstract: Natural language explanations in visual question answering (VQA-NLE) aim to
make black-box models more transparent by elucidating their decision-making
processes. However, we find that existing VQA-NLE systems can produce
inconsistent explanations and reach conclusions without genuinely understanding
the underlying context, exposing weaknesses in either their inference pipeline
or explanation-generation mechanism. To highlight these vulnerabilities, we not
only leverage an existing adversarial strategy to perturb questions but also
propose a novel strategy that minimally alters images to induce contradictory
or spurious outputs. We further introduce a mitigation method that leverages
external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model
robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely
used VQA-NLE models underscore the effectiveness of our attacks and the
potential of knowledge-based defenses, ultimately revealing pressing security
and reliability concerns in current VQA-NLE systems.

(LVLMs) for intelligent chest X-ray diagnosis and interpretable report
generation. X-Ray-CoT simulates human radiologists' "chain-of-thought" by first
extracting multi-modal features and visual concepts, then employing an
LLM-based component with a structured Chain-of-Thought prompting strategy to
reason and produce detailed natural language diagnostic reports. Evaluated on
the CORDA dataset, X-Ray-CoT achieves competitive quantitative performance,
with a Balanced Accuracy of 80.52% and F1 score of 78.65% for disease
diagnosis, slightly surpassing existing black-box models. Crucially, it
uniquely generates high-quality, explainable reports, as validated by
preliminary human evaluations. Our ablation studies confirm the integral role
of each proposed component, highlighting the necessity of multi-modal fusion
and CoT reasoning for robust and transparent medical AI. This work represents a
significant step towards trustworthy and clinically actionable AI systems in
medical imaging.

### [217] [Inverse-LLaVA: Eliminating Alignment Pre-training Through Text-to-Vision Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12466)
*Xuhui Zhan,Tyler Derr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inverse-LLaVA是一种新型多模态学习方法，无需对齐预训练，将文本嵌入映射到视觉表示空间，在推理任务上表现优异，计算需求减少45%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态学习方法需要昂贵的对齐预训练来桥接视觉和语言模态，通常将视觉特征投影到离散文本标记空间。本文挑战这一范式的两个基本假设。

Method: 提出Inverse-LLaVA方法，完全消除对齐预训练，反转传统映射方向：将文本嵌入映射到连续视觉表示空间，在transformer中间层进行融合，通过注意力机制中的选择性加性组件实现动态集成。

Result: 在9个多模态基准测试中显示细微性能权衡：推理密集型任务显著提升（MM-VET: +0.2%, VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, 认知推理: +27.2%），但在需要记忆视觉-文本关联的感知任务上有所下降（名人识别: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%）。计算需求减少45%。

Conclusion: 首次实证证明对齐预训练对于有效的多模态学习并非必要，特别是对于复杂推理任务。建立了一种减少计算需求、挑战传统模态融合观念的新范式，为保留模态特定特征的高效多模态架构开辟了新研究方向。

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment
pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting
visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental
assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel
approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the
conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text
space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation
space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through
selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic
integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive
image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves
notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,
VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing
expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text
associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results
provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not
necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning
tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces
computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about
modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal
architectures that preserve modality-specific characteristics. Our project

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a
critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology.
Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and
interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and
standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned
Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model
(LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform
interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each
fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with
clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models
are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting
neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from
EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium
are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized
reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision
support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform
orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning
LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning
workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid
system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex
assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of
neuromuscular diagnostics. To our knowledge, this work represents the first
integration of a fine-tuned VLM consortium with a reasoning LLM for image-based
H-reflex analysis, laying the foundation for next-generation AI-assisted
neuromuscular assessment and athlete monitoring platforms.

Abstract: Skin cancer classification is a crucial task in medical image analysis, where
precise differentiation between malignant and non-malignant lesions is
essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explore
Sequential and Parallel Hybrid CNN-Transformer models with Convolutional
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN). Our approach integrates transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation, where CNNs extract local spatial features,
Transformers model global dependencies, and CKAN facilitates nonlinear feature

results demonstrate that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures effectively
capture both spatial and contextual features, leading to improved

diverse datasets. This study highlights the significance of feature

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是工作年龄人群视力丧失的主要原因，早期检测可降低95%的视力丧失风险。但由于视网膜专家短缺和及时检查困难，检测面临挑战。AI模型虽然提供解决方案，但低质量数据和偏见阻碍了临床采用。

Method: 开发了RAIS-DR系统，在整个AI生命周期中整合伦理原则。系统集成了高效的卷积模型进行预处理、质量评估和三个专门的DR分类模型。在1,046名患者的本地数据集上进行评估，与FDA批准的EyeArt系统进行比较。

Conclusion: RAIS-DR是一个强大且符合伦理的DR筛查解决方案，有潜力减少医疗保健差距，适合临床环境应用。代码和权重已开源提供。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to
95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination
complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus
photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical
settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to
learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a
Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles
across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for
preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification
models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local
dataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated
significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by
6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as
Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable
performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to
reduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and
ethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings. The code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LoRA方法使用固定秩进行微调，可能限制了在不同多模态任务中的灵活性和效率。需要一种能够动态搜索最优LoRA秩配置的方法。

Method: 提出LangVision-LoRA-NAS框架，将神经架构搜索与LoRA结合，为特定多模态任务动态搜索最优的LoRA秩配置，平衡性能和计算效率。

Result: 在多个数据集上使用LLaMA-3.2-11B模型进行实验，LangVision-LoRA-NAS显著提升了模型性能，同时降低了微调成本。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态秩搜索优化了视觉语言模型的微调过程，在性能和效率之间取得了更好的平衡，为多模态任务提供了更灵活的适应方案。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual and text modalities to enable
multimodal understanding and generation. These models typically combine a
Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM)
for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning
method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates
to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for
fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current
implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and
efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces
\textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank
adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal
LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing
performance and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments using
the LLaMA-3.2-11B model on several datasets, LangVision-LoRA-NAS demonstrates
notable improvement in model performance while reducing fine-tuning costs. Our

Motivation: 鸟视图映射为自动驾驶感知提供结构化的顶视抽象，本研究旨在探索交叉视图变换器在这一任务中的效果。

Method: 使用现实模拟器生成城市驾驶数据，采用四摄像头布局，比较L1损失咈焦点损失两种损失函数的表现。

Result: 在仅使用一个城市训练数据的情况下，采用L1损失的四摄像头CVT模型在新城市中表现最为稳健。

Conclusion: 交叉视图变换器在将摄像头输入映射到准确鸟视图方面具有很大潜力。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is
crucial for autonomous-driving perception. In this work, we employ Cross-View
Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels -
road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for
urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of
different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using
training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss
delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall,
our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably
accurate BEV maps.

TL;DR: MuSACo是一个基于协同训练的多模态个性化表情识别方法，通过选择相关源主体并利用多模态互补信息进行主体特异性适应，在BioVid和StressID数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多源域适应方法往往忽视多模态信息或将多个源混合为单一域，限制了主体多样性，无法明确捕捉主体特异性特征。个性化表情识别需要适应主体间的高度变异性。

Method: 基于协同训练的多模态主体特异性选择和适应方法。选择与目标相关的源主体，使用主导模态生成伪标签进行类感知学习，结合类无关损失从低置信度目标样本中学习，对齐各模态源特征并仅组合高置信度目标特征。

Result: 在BioVid和StressID两个具有挑战性的多模态表情识别数据集上，MuSACo超越了无监督域适应（混合）和最先进的多源域适应方法。

Conclusion: MuSACo通过有效利用多模态和多源域信息，成功解决了个性化表情识别中的主体特异性适应问题，特别适用于数字健康中的情感计算应用。

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning
model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with
considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit
significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each
domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and
robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often
overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting
subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific
characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a
multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on
co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities
and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo
particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,
such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level
nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and
generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,
in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target
samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only
confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging
multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform
UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

Conclusion: 该框架通过视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，有效解决了跨领域图像伪造检测的泛化问题，提供了可解释的伪造检测和定位能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of
detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks
for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization.
While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for
specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space,
generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of
forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the
semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a
framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through
Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two
tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the
physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2)
Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and
analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different
domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language
Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by
them.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在大规模数据集上训练，但直接应用于老照片着色存在挑战，因为缺乏真实标签且自然灰度图与老照片存在域差距

Method: CNN-based SFAC算法，使用特征分布对齐损失建立语义对应，结合特征级感知约束和像素级冻结-更新金字塔的结构保持机制

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在老照片着色方面的有效性，通过定性和定量指标验证

Conclusion: SFAC算法成功解决了老照片着色的域差距问题，无需大数据依赖，实现了高质量的颜色迁移

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in
reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However,
directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is
challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap
between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a
novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature
Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo
colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct
processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our
primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two
images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We
achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust
to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence
to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable
structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving
mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a
frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: 该工作拓展了骨架动作理解的研究范围，鼓励更多关注密集预测任务，为骨架基础模型发展做出贡献。

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of
intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and
device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action
understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and
interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and
generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is
no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action
understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense
Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model
for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a
Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature
Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The
DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial
structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature
decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce
dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module
employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.
The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the
impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the
learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments
on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,
covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We
hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based
action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: 潜在连续推理是推进多模态大模型超越语言绑定思维链的有前景方向，为类人反思性多模态推理提供了可扩展框架

Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning
as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for
multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information
dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal
Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a
joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning
state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and
aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective
cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language
model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,
and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen
cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on
benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently
improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong
baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and
open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a
promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a
scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference. Code is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs)
have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive
architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The
sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high
inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them
unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD)
framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift.
ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of
entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational
latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing
the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports
progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD
outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning

TL;DR: 该研究构建了首个大规模UGC图像视觉失真评估指令调优数据集ViDA-UGC，包含11K图像和细粒度质量标注，通过CoT框架提升MLLMs的图像质量分析能力，在多个基准测试中超越GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释图像质量评估方法存在两个主要问题：对UGC和AIGC图像使用相同的失真评估标准不恰当，以及缺乏详细的图像质量分析来监控质量和指导图像修复。

Method: 通过失真导向的流程构建ViDA-UGC数据集，包含人工标注和CoT评估框架，指导GPT-4o生成质量描述。从数据集中精选476张图像和6149个QA对构建ViDA-UGC-Bench基准。

Result: 实验结果表明，ViDA-UGC数据集和CoT框架能持续增强多种基础MLLMs在ViDA-UGC-Bench和Q-Bench上的图像质量分析能力，甚至超越了GPT-4o的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为UGC图像质量评估提供了首个大规模数据集和基准，通过CoT框架有效提升了MLLMs的图像质量分析性能，为解决当前可解释IQA方法的局限性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a
paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image
quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like
quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA
methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both
User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also
lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image
restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual
Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed
ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding,
detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This
dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves
human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework.
This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying
and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual
features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we
carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from
ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of
GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to
the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT
framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities
across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing
GPT-4o.

Conclusion: 该研究通过新的数据集和模型有效解决了动作捕捉中的遮挡问题，已集成到MoSen系统中实际部署，代码已开源

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in
cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However,
system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common
in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary
limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately
reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of
training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which
incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker
occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving
model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with
significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,
OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep
constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across
diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future
studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the
MoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at:

Motivation: 现有视觉表示方法依赖频率指导或复杂神经网络解码，导致频谱损失或渲染速度慢，需要一种能同时提供灵活频率调制和快速渲染的连续视觉表示

Method: 基于小波的空间-频率局部化优势构建WIPES表示，开发基于小波的可微分光栅化器实现快速视觉渲染

Result: 在2D图像表示、5D静态和6D动态新视角合成等视觉任务中，WIPES相比基于INR的方法提供更高质量的渲染和更快的推理速度，在渲染质量上优于基于高斯的方法

Conclusion: WIPES作为一种视觉基元表示，能够有效平衡渲染质量和速度，在多种视觉任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Pursuing a continuous visual representation that offers flexible frequency
modulation and fast rendering speed has recently garnered increasing attention
in the fields of 3D vision and graphics. However, existing representations
often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to
spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose
WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing
multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency
localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the
low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop
a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering.
Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image
representation, 5D static and 6D dynamic novel view synthesis, demonstrate that
WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster
inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based
representations in rendering quality.

Motivation: 当前创意图片评估方法主要集中于排名，缺乏解释性，无法满足广告主对可解释创意选择的需求。AIGC技术能大量生产创意图片，但缺乏有效的质量评估方法。

Method: 构建CreativePair数据集（8k带注释的图片对），提出Creative4U模型，采用Reason-to-Select RFT训练方法（包括CoT-SFT和GRPO强化学习），将创意评估与选择转换为自然语言生成任务。

Result: 离线和在线实验都证明了方法的有效性，能够准确评估和选择创意图片。

Conclusion: 该研究首次提出了解释性创意评估与选择的范式，通过MLLMs技术实现了根据用户兴趣的创意图片选择，为研究和产业应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform.
An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users,
boosting income for advertisers and advertising revenue for platforms. With the
advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative
images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality
to select. Existing methods primarily focus on creative ranking, which fails to
address the need for explainable creative selection.
  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative
assessment and selection. Powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a
natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct
CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset
featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label
indicating which image is superior. Additionally, we introduce Creative4U
(pronounced Creative for You), a MLLMs-based creative selector that takes into
account users' interests. Through Reason-to-Select RFT, which includes
supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement learning, Creative4U is able to
evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code and dataset
will be made public to advance research and industrial applications.

Result: 在四个数据集的三个实时视视觉任务上经过大量实验验证了框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该新范式为未来VLM系统中更有效和延迟感知的协同策略奠定了基础

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time
applications such as autonomous driving and human-computer interaction, which
demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these
requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative
architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task
offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).
However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and
overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this
work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed
Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical
context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this
paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and
visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual
grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks
across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware
collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

Motivation: 对比增强MRI导入镍基对比剂带来成本、执行时间、环境和病人风险问题，需要无对比剂的替代方案

Method: 两阶段流模型管道：先用片基3D U-Net预测后骏均值，然后用时间条件化3D正流模型精炼，以给合真实细节和结构保真

Result: 在360份测试数据上，精炼后输出达到FID 12.46和KID 0.007（比后骏均值改善68.7%），保持低平方误差0.057，能恢复病变边缘和血管细节

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了觉知-失真交换问题，为临床部署提供了可行的无对比剂对比增强MRI生成方案

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic
diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time,
raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we
propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for
synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a
patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE).
Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow
to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We
train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and
post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360
diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and
KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while
maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the
posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores
lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the
perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有的持续测试时适配方法在平衡新域适配咈历史知识利用方面遇到了挑战：1）基于深层输出调整预测效率低；2）单一模型容易遗忘历史知识。

Method: 提出了一种基于mean teacher框架的方法：1）多层次一致性正则化(MCR)捕捉浅层特征加速适配；2）补充性锐销回放(CAR)机制重现历史检查点保留多样化知识。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上，该方法显著超越了现有的最先进方法，证明了其在持续测试时适配任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: BEE方法通过合理平衡新域适配咈历史知讬利用，有效解决了CTTA中的关键挑战，为持续学习领域提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental
principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains
(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously
encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite
significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still
challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on
deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect
shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,
leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge
of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting
historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an
appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA
process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency
Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student
and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the
latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to
reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for
diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness
for CTTA tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效处理时间不同步和节奏不一致问题，确保在严重遮挡情况下仍能实现鲁棒且合理的运动恢复。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly
important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.
However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,
causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical
impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first
framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of
individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a
coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust
crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and
severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based
human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The
core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term
dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals
with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous
Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion
segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and
plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization
and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no
existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual
benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction
from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd
reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research
purposes.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的两阶段演进式人体去遮捏方法有效解决了严重遮挡下的人体恢复问题，为人体相关计算机视觉任务提供了更好的前置处理方案。

Abstract: Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior
knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to
accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task.
De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB
appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically
targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our
approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB
completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to
provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with
occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.
The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the
second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To
further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features
derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP
encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder
fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a
known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent
space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances
even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in
both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our
approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as
2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly
available.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在自动化艺术分析方面具有巨大潜力，微调后的CLIP模型能够有效理解和预测复杂的艺术风格特征。

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing
stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric
effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally
evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can
interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent
advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability
to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for
this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on
large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our
findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic
elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art
images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP,
on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its
ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the
potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Conclusion: 通过综合多域高质量数据和精心设计的训练策略，可以有效提升VLM模型的广泛视觉推理能力，解决现有模型域限性问题

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on
a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a
result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning
capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of
readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined
areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the
compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address
these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset
from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such
as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface,
medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function
based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify
high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the
VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to
iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks,
outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at

Conclusion: AdaBEV通过自适应实例感知的BEV表示学习方法，有效解决了多无人机协同3D检测中的计算效率问题，为资源受限平台提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception
by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant
advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for
computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present
AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV
representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods
that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement
Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to
enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV
grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial
subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and
background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive
experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves
superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming
other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound
performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible
overhead.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically

TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains.
Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain
detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to

detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes
repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the
traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains
unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data
from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two
components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability
and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce
multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple
previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so
the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement
dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that
accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps
the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components
significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the
CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了自主驾驶车不同相机传感器配置导致的跨传感器域差异问题，提出了CamShift数据集和一种基于神经渲染的数据驱动传感器适配方案，有效减少了跨传感器性能泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主驾驶车的相机传感器配置因车辆类型不同而异，导致在一种传感器配置上训练的感知模型在其他配置上性能显著降低，这就是跨传感器域差异问题。

Method: 创建了CamShift数据集（受nuScenes启发在CARLA中模拟）来专门研究跨传感器域差。评估了各种3D物体检测器的稳健性，并提出了一种基于神经渲染的数据驱动传感器适配管道，可以将整个数据集转换以匹配不同相机传感器配置。

Result: 证明了跨传感器性能显著泄漏，识别了模型稳健性对模型架构的依赖关系（BEVFormer类模型最稳健）。提出的神经渲染适配方案大幅度减少了跨传感器域差，提高了所有研究的3D检测器的性能。

Conclusion: 传感器配置差异对自主驾驶感知模型有重大影响，BEV基础模型更稳健，而神经渲染适配技术可以有效减少数据重新收集需求，提高数据在不同传感器配置之间的可重用性。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is
inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types.
Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new,
different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically
leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this
end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA
to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport
utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant
cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model
architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the
one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View
(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most
robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a
novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which
can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying
this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,
mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need
for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles
with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation
benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态错误信息的扩散对公众话语和社会信任构成威胁。生成式AI工具带来的新闻多样性导致多层级漂移，显著降低了当前基于大型视觉语言模型的多模态错误信息检测系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI工具的兴起，新闻内容变得高度多样化和复杂化，这给多模态错误信息检测带来了新的挑战。研究旨在系统性地研究生成式AI驱动的新闻多样性如何影响现有检测系统的性能。

Method: 引入了DriftBench大规模基准测试，包含16,000个新闻实例，涵盖六种多样化类别。设计了三个评估任务：多层级漂移下的真实性验证鲁棒性、对生成式AI生成对抗性证据污染的敏感性分析，以及跨多样化输入的推理一致性分析。

Result: 对六个最先进的基于LVLM的检测器进行实验，结果显示性能显著下降（平均F1分数下降14.8%），推理轨迹越来越不稳定，在对抗性证据注入下失败更加严重。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有MMD系统的基本脆弱性，表明在生成式AI时代迫切需要更具弹性的方法来解决多模态错误信息检测问题。

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to
public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the
rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven
news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show
that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level
misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal
reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades
the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts
significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To
systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of
diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth
verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial
evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning
consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art
LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and
increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under
adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental
vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more
resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像生成模型在实际图像编辑中的两大挑战：用户难以精确描述图像细节的提示词，以及现有方法在修改目标区域时容易导致非期望的其他区域变化

Method: 提出Dual Contrastive Denoising Score框架，通过在潜在扩散模型的自注意力层中引入简单的双对比损失，利用中间表征的丰富空间信息，无需辅助网络

Conclusion: 该方法能够同时实现灵活的内容修改和结构保持，还支持零样本图像到图像转换，为实际图像编辑提供了一种简单而高效的解决方案

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to
synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to
directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it
is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately
describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models
can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically
alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.
To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a
simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of
text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for
unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual
contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the
extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the
self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary
networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure
preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot
image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining
the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models
without further training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然3D高斯拓扑在密集视角下表现出色，但在稀疏视角场景中存在新视角外观偏差问题。研究发现这是因为高斯元素之间过度耦合，过分适配训练视图而忽视了场景真实的外观分布。

Method: 提出了一种称为协同适应分数(CA)的指标来量化高斯元素间的耦合程度，并基于分析结果提出了两种轻量级策略：(1)随机高斯投弃技术 (2)不透明度乘性噪声注入技术。

Result: 分析显示随着训练视图数量增加，协同适应效应自然减弱。提出的两种策略在多个方法和测试集上都验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了3D高斯拓扑在稀疏视角下的核心限制，并提供了简单有效的解决方案。希望通过对协同适应效应的深入分析，能够激励研究社区对稀疏视角3DGS有更全面的理解。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel
view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios,
despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests
appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance
artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current
approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to
aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real
appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance
artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed
Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,
i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple
renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.
The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated
as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose
two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in
sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise
injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and
their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope
that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Motivation: 现有方法依靠空间特征进行内核估计，但在严重模糊区域性能会降低，因为局部高频细节信息缺失。需要利用频域表示来增强内核建模的结构可识别性。

Method: 提出FDIKP网络：1)双分支逆内核预测策略(DIKP)利用频域优势提高估计准确性；2)位置适配卷积(PAC)增强反卷积过程的适应性；3)双域尺度递归模块(DSRM)融合反卷积结果并逐步改善去模糊质量。

Result: 大量实验证明，该方法在单图散焦去模糊任务中超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合频域表示和空间特征，提出的FDIKP网络能够更准确地建模空间变化模糊内核，尤其在严重模糊区域表现更优。

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a
defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels
remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for
kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions
where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a
Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates
frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in
kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency
domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction
(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while
maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted
inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance
the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a
Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and
progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code
will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种深度类别特定协同表示网络（DCSCR），用于解决少样本图像集分类问题，通过同时学习框架级和概念级特征表示来提高分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像集分类中存在两个关键挑战：如何学习有效特征表示和如何探索不同图像集之间的相似性。传统方法忽视特征学习，而深度方法在测量集距离时无法自适应调整特征，导致少样本分类性能有限。

Method: 结合传统图像集分类方法与深度模型，提出DCSCR网络。包含三个模块：全卷积深度特征提取器模块、全局特征学习模块和基于类别特定协同表示的距离度量学习模块。前两个模块学习框架级特征，后者学习概念级特征表示并通过新的CSCR对比损失函数获取集距离相似性。

Result: 在多个知名少样本图像集分类数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果表明所提方法相比一些最先进的图像集分类算法具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: DCSCR网络能够同时学习图像集的框架级和概念级特征表示，并通过自适应的方式探索不同集之间的相似性，有效解决了少样本图像集分类的挑战。

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing
similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with
variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in
recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore
the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging
issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image
sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.
Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively
adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited
performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines
traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC
approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)
network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature
representations of each image set and the distance similarities between
different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep
feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The
deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn
(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is
exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each
image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by
developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on
several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴影移除任务中，受阴影区域的修复变换与良照区域差异显著，需要有效整合非局部上下文线索和适应性建模区域特定变换

Method: 设计了双规模融合Mamba块(DFMB)提升多规模特征表征，以及双路径Mamba组(DPMG)通过水平扫描捕获全局特征，结合掩码识别适应性扫描策略

Result: 在阴影移除标准数据集上显著超过现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过选择性上下文传播和区域特定变换建模，有效解决了阴影移除中的区域差异性挑战

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows,
where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general
restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage
abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the
transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly
from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform
correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local
contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To
this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion
and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on
transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale
Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing
original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary
artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via
horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,
which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

Abstract: Computer vision models can be used to assist during mechanical thrombectomy
(MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), but poor image quality often degrades
performance. This work presents CLAIRE-DSA, a deep learning--based framework
designed to categorize key image properties in minimum intensity projections
(MinIPs) acquired during MT for AIS, supporting downstream quality control and
workflow optimization. CLAIRE-DSA uses pre-trained ResNet backbone models,
fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,
projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained
on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model
achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$
to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of
CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by
filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on
filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from
$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an
automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of
acute ischemic stroke patients, supporting image annotation and quality control
in clinical and research applications. Source code is available at

Motivation: CdZnTe半导体图像标注困难，低对比度缺陷边界需要多视图交叉参考，传统半监督分割方法受限于'一对一'关系，在低对比度区域容易产生误差累积和确认偏差

Method: 提出Intra-group Consistency Augmentation Framework (ICAF)，包含Intra-group View Sampling (IVS)建立组导向基线，Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN)增强一致性表示，包含View Augmentation Module (VAM)动态合成边界感知视图，View Correction Module (VCM)进行信息交互强调显著区域

Result: 在CdZnTe数据集上使用DeepLabV3+和ResNet-101骨干网络，仅用2%组标注数据就达到70.6% mIoU

Conclusion: ICAF框架有效解决了CdZnTe材料的多视图标注难题，通过组内一致性增强显著提升了低对比度缺陷边界的分割性能

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging
due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to
cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),
forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders
advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as
they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image
is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error
accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.
To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented
perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency
Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent
consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented
baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,
we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency
representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module
(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware
view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module
(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information
interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe
materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation
model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2
group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT),
UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the
analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems.
However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale
variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely
hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed
at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex
urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the
detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.
The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of
trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.
The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors
to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly
improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.
Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical
trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,
effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the
UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant
improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,
highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack
is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with
existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in
image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing
methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in
the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle
content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging
multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent
content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both
image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the
denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can
intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the
denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill
a small representative set of attention features from the large number of
attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our
experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results
for stylization.

TL;DR: 利用路视图像和深度学习技术发展了一种全球规模估算自行车和摩托车使用水平的新方法，通过分析185个城市的Google Street View图像得到了准确的预测结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通方式影响健康，但全球范围内自行车和摩托车行为的比较数据缺乏，需要有效的方法来收集这些数据

Method: 使用YOLOv4模型分析185个全球城市的Google Street View图像（每个城市8000张），识别自行车和摩托车，然后使用beta回归模型预测交通方式分享率

Result: 模型识别准确度达89%，摩托车计数与实际使用率相关系数为0.78，自行车为0.51，预测模型R²值均超0.61，绝对误差仅1.3-1.4%

Conclusion: 路视图像结合计算机视觉技术能够有效捕捉交通行为数据，为传统数据源提供了有价值的补充，特别是在数据缺乏的地区

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air
pollution and injury risk.Comparative data on cycling and motorcycling
behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such
as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable
resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study
demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to
estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We
utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and
motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to
detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per
city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean
average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A
global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level
mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of
GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for
population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts
and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle
counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode
shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling,
achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though
cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities
globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates
for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer
vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights
alongside traditional data sources.

TL;DR: 使用预训练的ResNet50和ViT模型，通过极坐标变换和hexbin可视化技术分析风叙变星光曲图像，实现了高精度的双星系统分离与接触分类，但旭发现效果辣差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对大规模天文调查中风叙变星分类的需求，探索计算机视觉方法在光曲分析中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用预训练的ResNet50和ViT模型，将相位折叠光曲转换为极坐标形式并结合hexbin可视化，构建了两步分层分类策略：先分离/接触分类，再识别旭组织。

Result: 主要分类任务在多个通道(Gaia G、I、TESS)验证集上达到>96%精度，在OGLE、DEBCat、WUMaCat观测数据上也表现优异(>94%，TESS达100%)。但旭发现效果差。

Conclusion: 计算机视觉在大规模风叙变星形态分类中展现强大潜力，但需进一步研究更稳健的自动化旭发现技术。

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

Motivation: 传统图像生成方法缺乏层次化的细粒度控制，需要一种能够从全局到局部逐步精化的生成框架

Method: 提出Next Visual Granularity (NVG)生成框架，将图像解构为具有相同空间分辨率但不同粒度级别的序列，从空白图像开始逐步精化生成

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上训练的NVG模型显示了明显的扩展性能，在FID指标上一致超过VAR系列(3.30->3.03, 2.57->2.44, 2.09->2.06)

Conclusion: NVG框架通过层次化的视觉粒度序列表示，提供了多粒度级别的细粒度控制能力，在图像生成性能方面取得显著改进

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30
-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to
showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing
marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous
exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on
mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and
autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant
challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade
image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation
difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep
learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and
high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed
Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to
adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and
simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our
comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority
over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural
consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA
has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms
for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous
navigation.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型迅速迁移学习方法在复杂跨域任务中表现有限，特别是当图像领域与自然图像差异较大时

Method: 提出CoMuCo策略，使用两个功能互补的专家模块提取多视图特征，结合先验知识的一致性约束和信息几何基础的共识机制

Result: 在新建立的跨域少样本测试集上，CoMuCo正常超过现有方法，表现出更好的性能

Conclusion: CoMuCo通过多视图协同优化有效提升了视觉-语言模型在跨域少样本任务中的适应能力，为跨域学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data,
such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image
recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer
learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs
and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their
effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where
imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we
propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a
novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally
complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while
incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information
geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature
learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to
help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural
images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed
benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot
tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型微调方法往往忽略数据分布的几何结构，可能导致整体语义表示的扭曲，需要一种能够保持流形结构的方法

Method: 将特征空间中的数据分布视为语义流形，通过对齐微调前后的Gram矩阵来保持流形的宏观和微观拓扑结构，并优化图像-文本模态特征对的相似性来增强类别可分性

Result: 大量实验表明MPS-Tuning显著提升了模型性能，同时有效保持了语义流形的结构

Conclusion: MPS-Tuning通过几何结构约束和类别可分性增强，为视觉语言模型的微调提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable
potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective
transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge
of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting
through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.
However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data
distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic
representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning
method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the
data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning
explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further
sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves
both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original
manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.
Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text
modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the
manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively
preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

Motivation: 研究发现Classifier-free Guidance (CFG)方法在扩散模型中会产生与真实情况不符的次优预测结果，导致语义不连贯和低质量输出，需要改进现有引导策略。

Method: 提出S²-Guidance方法，利用前向过程中的随机块丢弃构建随机子网络，通过这些子网络有效精炼模型的次优预测，引导模型远离低质量预测并趋向高质量输出。

Result: 在文本到图像和文本到视频生成任务上的大量定性和定量实验表明，S²-Guidance始终优于CFG和其他先进引导策略，提供卓越的性能表现。

Conclusion: S²-Guidance通过利用模型自身的子网络来优化预测，有效解决了CFG方法的局限性，为扩散模型提供了更高质量的引导机制。

Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion
models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an
empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we
observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the
ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions
often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this
issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions
can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on
this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic
block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,
effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and
toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that
S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and
other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

Conclusion: ONG提供了一种有效的稀疏化策略，能够在训练过程中保持结构完整性，并提供明确的机制来达到目标稀疏度。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success but their large
size poses deployment challenges. While various pruning techniques exist, many
involve complex iterative processes, specialized criteria, or struggle to
maintain sparsity effectively during training. We introduce ONG (One-shot
NMF-based Gradient Masking), a novel sparsification strategy that identifies
salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for
one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise
gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated,
strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We
integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable
sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve
comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining
structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting
desired sparsities.

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has
the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation,
privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data
while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become
achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching
transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and
the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against
state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our
approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image
alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered
significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent
works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature
extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to
effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic
information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space
via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the
representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral
cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and
pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an
encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR
points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to
mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D
convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point
aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from
LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal
refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an
intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel
proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with
both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the
superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Conclusion: 7Bench填补了布局对齐评估的空白，为布局引导文本到图像生成提供了全面的评估框架，有助于提升合成数据质量。

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation
process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement
of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision
applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A
critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual
prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although
recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,
and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability
to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using
layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and
degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to
assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image
generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging
scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute
recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an
evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the
layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective
strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is

Motivation: 当前异常检测方法主要针对低分辨率场景，高分辨率图像的传统下采样会导致细粒度判别信息丢失，造成细微异常区域漏检。现有方法在检测精度和效率方面难以满足工业场景实际需求。

Method: 采用双分支架构集成不同尺度的异常线索，结合多分辨率特征融合策略处理高分辨率图像的细粒度纹理变化。使用检测器池和多种检测器分配策略，根据图像块特征自适应分配检测器。

Conclusion: HiAD框架能够有效解决高分辨率图像异常检测的挑战，在检测精度和计算效率方面都表现出色，适用于工业实际应用场景。

Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution
scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results
in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of
fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies
have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight
networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these
approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios
in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we
propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD
is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution
images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a
dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales
to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore,
it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the
challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.
To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in
conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to
be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance
while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive
experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection
benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark
RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD. The code is

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for
adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or
more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term
knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging
incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have
achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the
generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it
helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and
robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual
methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their
effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform
even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical
samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a
two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on
sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,
SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized
representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and
balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation
(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more
generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD
for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of its components. The code is available at

Abstract: Anatomic tracer studies are critical for validating and improving diffusion
MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, large-scale analysis of data from such
studies is hampered by the labor-intensive process of annotating fiber bundles
manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse
bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections,
limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined,
fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data,
based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware
sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common
errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse
bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared
to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This
new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data
at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to
validate and optimize dMRI tractography methods.

TL;DR: Lumen是一个端到端的视频重光照框架，基于大规模视频生成模型，通过文本描述控制光照和背景，在保持前景一致性的同时实现和谐的视频重光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频重光照是一个具有挑战性但有价值的任务，需要在替换视频背景的同时相应调整前景光照并实现和谐融合。现有方法缺乏高质量的多光照条件配对视频数据，且难以保持前景属性（如反照率）和时序一致性。

Method: 构建混合真实和合成视频的大规模数据集；使用3D渲染引擎生成合成视频对；采用HDR光照模拟补充真实视频；设计联合训练课程，注入域感知适配器解耦重光照和域外观分布学习。

Result: 实验结果表明Lumen能够有效编辑输入视频，生成具有一致光照和严格前景保持的电影级重光照视频，在综合基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Lumen框架通过大规模混合数据集和域感知适配器设计，成功解决了视频重光照中的前景保持和时序一致性问题，为视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the
background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the
foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to
preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate
consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,
an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video
generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the
control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified
paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we
construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic
videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the
community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in
diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting
simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the
aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively
unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in
synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.
To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple
the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from
the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into
cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground
preservation. Our project page: https://lumen-relight.github.io/

TL;DR: MaskSem是一种新颖的语义引导掩码方法，通过Grad-CAM基于相对运动来指导关节掩码，并使用混合高阶运动作为重建目标，提升了自监督骨架动作识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督骨架动作识别方法主要关注有限关节集和低阶运动模式，限制了模型对复杂运动模式的理解能力。

Method: 提出语义引导掩码方法MaskSem，利用基于相对运动的Grad-CAM指导关节掩码；使用混合高阶运动（低阶速度和高阶加速度）作为重建目标。

Result: 在NTU60、NTU120和PKU-MMD数据集上的实验表明，MaskSem结合普通transformer提升了骨架动作识别性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能更全面地描述动态运动过程，增强对运动模式的理解，更适合人机交互应用。

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics,
particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based
reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the
skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.
However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion
patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.
To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking
method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel
framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of
joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal
orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore
more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order
motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order
motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion
acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach
offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,
enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the
NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla
transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more
suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

Motivation: 现有医学影像领域的强化微调方法主要针对封闭式VQA，限制了临床应用的实用性。开放式医学VQA更符合临床实践但研究不足，且基于模型的语义奖励存在奖励崩塌问题

Method: 首先在思维链数据上进行监督微调融入领域知识，然后应用强化学习结合文本正确性和自适应语义奖励来增强推理质量

Conclusion: 奖励可区分性在医学强化学习中至关重要，语义引导的奖励对于实现鲁棒且具有临床意义的多模态推理具有重要前景

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong
potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing
computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains
underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this
domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting
their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended
medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited
attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via
semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often
suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic
differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive
Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended
medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning
with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning
quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results
show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving
a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain
benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward
discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards
for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has become an invaluable imaging
modality in dentistry, enabling 3D visualization of teeth and surrounding
structures for diagnosis and treatment planning. Automated segmentation of
dental structures in CBCT can efficiently assist in identifying pathology
(e.g., pulpal or periapical lesions) and facilitate radiation therapy planning
in head and neck cancer patients. We describe the DLaBella29 team's approach
for the MICCAI 2025 ToothFairy3 Challenge, which involves a deep learning
pipeline for multi-class tooth segmentation. We utilized the MONAI Auto3DSeg
framework with a 3D SegResNet architecture, trained on a subset of the
ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key
preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution
and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE
on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted
tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2
segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average
Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This
paper details the clinical context, data preparation, model development,
results of our approach, and discusses the relevance of automated dental
segmentation for improving patient care in radiation oncology.

TL;DR: GazeDETR是一种新颖的端到端架构，使用两个解耦的解码器分别处理头部定位和视线预测任务，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端视线目标检测模型使用单一解码器同时定位人头部和预测视线，导致表示纠缠。需要解耦这两个任务以获得更好的性能。

Method: 提出GazeDETR架构，包含两个独立的解码器：一个用于头部定位（利用局部信息），另一个用于视线预测（结合局部和全局信息），使用连贯注意力场。

Result: 在GazeFollow、VideoAttentionTarget和ChildPlay数据集上达到最先进结果，显著优于现有端到端模型。

Conclusion: 解耦的架构设计能够更好地学习各自任务的独特表示，证明了局部和全局信息结合在视线预测中的重要性，为视线通信量化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions.
Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital
phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only
utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict
their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This
multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation
for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose
GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that
individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent
attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its
human head predictor utilizes local information, while its gaze decoder
incorporates both local and global information. Our proposed architecture
achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget and
ChildPlay datasets. It outperforms existing end-to-end models with a notable
margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分析视频波散Transformer的注意力矩阵结构，发现其存在异质性稀疏模式，提出Compact Attention加速框架，通过适配到砖、变长时间窗口和自动配置搜索，实现1.6~2.5倍注意力计算加速，保持相当的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制的计算需求给Transformer基于视频生成带来严重挑战，特别是在生成超长序列时。现有的因子化注意力和固定稀疏模式方法无法充分利用视频数据中的内在时空冗余性。

Method: 提出Compact Attention加速框架，包括：1）适配到砖策略，通过动态到砖分组近似多样的空间交互模式；2）时间变化窗口，根据帧距离调整稀疏程度；3）自动化配置搜索算法，在保留关键注意力途径的同时优化稀疏模式。

Result: 在单GPU环境下实现了注意力计算1.6~2.5倍的加速效果，同时保持了与全注意力基准方法相当的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构化稀疏利用提供了一种有理论基础的方法，用于开启高效的长形式视频生成。

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical
challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing
ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and
fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal
redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion
transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit
structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads
dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,
cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods
either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting
their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a
hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive
tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via
dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity
levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search
algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention
pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on
single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with
full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking
efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

Motivation: 解决现有零样本NAS代理方法对标签数据的依赖问题，以及仅关注汇聚性/普遍化性或单纯表达能力的限制，需要一种综合考虑各方面性能的方法。

Method: 利用神经网络层特征的奇异值分解(SVD)和网络输出的外在曲率来设计代理。通过简化调和平均的对数组合来结合特征条件数的逆和输出曲率两个关键组件。

Result: 在NAS-Bench-101、NAS-Bench-201、TransNAS-Bench-101-micro等多个相关性测试中表现艶越，在DARTS和AutoFormer搜索空间的NAS任务中也显示出显著效果，仅需单个无标签数据样本即可预测网络性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地结合了汇聚性、普遍化性和表达能力三个重要网络特性，提供了一种高效、无需标签数据的零样本NAS解决方案，在多个领域和数据集上都显示出良好的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the
architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at
initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on
labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.
Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the
convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the
network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how
channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a
neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and
expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the
requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and
the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a
result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the
logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature
condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our
approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using
only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total
of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search
space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The
proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation
benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and
TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the
AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient. The code is

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts
of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a
comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This
paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object
tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,
MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,
modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.
Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,
laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a
discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and
annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on
different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the
auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental
configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth
(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part
of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an
omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),
covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we
discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always
guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of
information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is
beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the
distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,
revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal
categories when compared with RGB datasets.

Method: 通过实证研究提供证据，分析增强特征多样性对开放集样本识别和持续学习性能的影响

Result: 增强特征多样性确实能够改善开放集样本的识别，同时在持续学习中有助于保持先前学习的数据并促进新数据的整合

Conclusion: 特征多样性在开放集识别和持续学习中扮演重要角色，这一发现可为这两个领域的实践方法和理论理解提供新的研究灵感

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges
in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at
inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many
recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by
heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined
the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we
provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the
recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also
facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration
of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further
research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these
domains.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to
overcome occlusion and limited sensor range by sharing intermediate features.
Yet transmitting dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps can overwhelm the
bandwidth available for inter-vehicle communication. We present SlimComm, a
communication-efficient framework that integrates 4D radar Doppler with a
query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to
distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i)
reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory
queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV
features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable
attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we
release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler
radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion
model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and
interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on
bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting
real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world
dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical
context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an
interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step
auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)
A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to

TL;DR: 提出了EgoTwin框架，用于联合生成第一人称视角视频和人体运动，解决了视角对齐和因果交互两个关键挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然外中心视角视频合成取得了很大进展，但第一人称视角视频生成仍然研究不足，需要同时建模第一人称视角内容和穿戴者身体运动引起的相机运动模式

Method: 基于扩散变换器架构构建EgoTwin框架，引入以头部为中心的运动表示，并采用控制论启发的交互机制在注意力操作中显式捕捉视频与运动之间的因果交互

Result: 构建了大规模真实世界的文本-视频-运动三元组数据集，设计了新颖的指标来评估视频-运动一致性，大量实验证明了EgoTwin框架的有效性

Conclusion: EgoTwin框架成功解决了第一人称视频和人体运动联合生成的关键挑战，为这一未充分探索的领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric
video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling
first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the
wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint
egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key
challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated
video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;
2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the
observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these
challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built
on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a
head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head
joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that
explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within
attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale
real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel
metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

Motivation: 深度学习心脏MRI重建在多个临床中心部署时面临显著的域偏移挑战，不同扫描仪配置和成像协议导致性能下降。

Method: 使用分层适配器框架：协议级适配器处理序列特定特征，中心级适配器处理扫描仪相关变化，基于变分展开主干网络，通过通用适配器实现未见中心的泛化。

Result: 在CMRxRecon2025数据集（5+中心、10+扫描仪、9种模态）上的综合评估显示，该方法在保持重建质量的同时具有优异的跨中心泛化性能。

Conclusion: HierAdaptMR通过分层特征适应有效解决了多中心心脏MRI重建的域偏移问题，为临床部署提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning-based cardiac MRI reconstruction faces significant domain shift
challenges when deployed across multiple clinical centers with heterogeneous
scanner configurations and imaging protocols. We propose HierAdaptMR, a
hierarchical feature adaptation framework that addresses multi-level domain
variations through parameter-efficient adapters. Our method employs
Protocol-Level Adapters for sequence-specific characteristics and Center-Level
Adapters for scanner-dependent variations, built upon a variational unrolling
backbone. A Universal Adapter enables generalization to entirely unseen centers
through stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The
framework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and
contrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation
on the CMRxRecon2025 dataset spanning 5+ centers, 10+ scanners, and 9
modalities demonstrates superior cross-center generalization while maintaining
reconstruction quality. code: https://github.com/Ruru-Xu/HierAdaptMR

TL;DR: 一种基于视觉-语言模型的扫描指导技术，通过识别重要物体并生成球面代理来指导用户进行密集视角采集，以支持高质量新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前新视角合成技术已经取得重大进步，但在帮助人类收集输入图像方面关注较少。高质量合成需要均匀密集的视角采样，而这对人类摄影师来说很难做到。

Method: 利用语义分割和类别识别，通过视觉-语言模型评分重要物体，然后在高排名物体周围生成球面代理来指导用户扫描。

Result: 在真实场景中表现出艶于传统视角采样策略的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效指导用户进行多尺度扫描，特别是对需要扩展图像覆盖的视角依赖外观的重要物体。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,
has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for
demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting
humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has
received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and
dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed
by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding
of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to
guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect
view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated
visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of
a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image
coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we
leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a
vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked
objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior
performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

Motivation: 人体形状编辑领域缺乏大规模数据集，现有方法存在身体比例不协调、纹理扭曲和背景不一致等问题

Method: 构建了18,573张图片的大规模数据集，提出Odo结构：冻结UNet保留外观和背景细节，ControlNet通过SMPL深度地图指导形状变换

Result: 在重建误差方面显著优于基线方法（7.5mm vs 13.6mm），能够产生现实而准确的目标形状

Conclusion: 该方法为人体形状编辑提供了有效的解决方案，通过洞洞模型与深度控制的结合，实现了高质量的身体重塑效果

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body
shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity,
clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced
rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches
typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing
unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background
inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is
the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and
evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the
first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically
designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in
body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent
identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose
Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive
body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a
frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from
the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target
SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,
significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while
producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

Method: 第一阶段使用眼动导向对比学习框架，整合视觉特征、临床标签、盒子和眼动信号，采用多项眼动注意力损失函数；第二阶段通过模块化报告生成流程，提取信心度加权诊断关键词并映射到解剖学区域

Result: 眼动数据将F1分数从0.597提升到0.631（+5.70%），AUC从0.821提升到0.849（+3.41%），同时提高了精确率和召回率；报告生成在临床关键词召回率和ROUGE重叠指标上都有显著改善

Conclusion: 集成眼动数据能够同时提升疾病分类性能和生成医学报告的可解释性，证明了眼动监督在医学图像分析中的重要价值

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease
classification and region-aware radiology report generation from chest X-rays,
leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a
gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It
integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist
eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention
loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment.
Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC
from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall,
highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the
second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts
confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using
a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates
region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report
quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results
demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance
and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

Abstract: Nowadays, the development of a Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) system for
ID cards presents a challenge due to the lack of images available to train a
robust PAD system and the increase in diversity of possible attack instrument
species. Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not
take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of
the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating
synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the
generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images
generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial
solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our
images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and
data restrictions.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges
in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual
content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and
explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to
shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel
RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253
questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or
more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model
called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its
decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,
we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy
decision-making in RSVQA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督立体匹配和单目深度估计方法在遮挡区域存在对应像素缺失的问题，导致光度重建模糊，需要更好的解决方案来建立明确的光度对应关系。

Method: 通过微调Stable Diffusion模型，沿极线方向生成三个新视角图像（左-左视图、右-右视图和中间视图），补充遮挡像素以实现明确的光度重建。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，异常值减少高达35%，仅使用未标注的立体图像对进行训练和合成。

Conclusion: DMS是一种即插即用的免费方法，能有效增强自监督立体匹配和单目深度估计，为解决遮挡问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced
significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using
stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and
require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity
introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing
corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as
occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit
photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that
utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along
the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we
finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:
left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the
right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right
cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit
photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''
method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular
depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both
training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 海滩污染是全球急需解决的环境问题，需要可扩展的自动化监测方案。

Method: 使用RT-DETR-L和RT-DETR-X两个模型变体，在公开海岸垃圾数据集上进行训练和比较分析。

Result: RT-DETR-X模型较RT-DETR-L模型有略高的检测精度(mAP@50: 0.816 vs 0.810)，但RT-DETR-L模型的推理速度更快(20.1ms vs 34.5ms)。

Conclusion: RT-DETR-L模型在处理速度和检测准确性之间得到更优的平衡，更适合实时现场部署。

Abstract: Coastal pollution is a pressing global environmental issue, necessitating
scalable and automated solutions for monitoring and management. This study
investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a
state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated
detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is
conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and
RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of
coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves
marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU
(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's
0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized
at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a
substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the
RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more
practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its
superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research
provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based
detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs
between model complexity and operational viability.

Result: 在相似骨骼和跨物种骨骼迁移场景中都表现出高效可靠的性能，成功集成到下游应用和用户界面中

Conclusion: 该方法具有工业应用潜力，为跨拓扑结构的动画迁移提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters
whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have
advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse
topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent
topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts
the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,
the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different
topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven
approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,
training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only
one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set
of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both
similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical
utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in
downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for
industrial applications. Code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有的3D场景重建方法存在多阶段流程复杂、需要密集扫描、对遮挡区域处理效果差等问题，难以实现完整且可交互的3D场景重建。

Method: 提出IGFuse框架，通过多扫描融合构建分割感知的高斯场，引入双向光度和语义一致性约束，使用伪中间场景状态进行统一对齐，并采用协作共剪枝策略优化几何结构。

Conclusion: IGFuse无需密集观测或复杂流程即可实现高保真渲染和对象级场景操作，为3D场景重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent
object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a
single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing
approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,
background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,
both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a
novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing
observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between
captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation
aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic
consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a
pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative
co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity
rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or
complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong
generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness
for real world 3D reconstruction and real-to-simulation transfer. Our project

TL;DR: SamKV是首个针对多上下文KV Cache的注意力稀疏化方法，通过考虑其他上下文的互补信息进行稀疏化并局部重计算，在RAG场景中将序列长度压缩至15%且不损失精度


<details>

Motivation: 大语言模型在长序列推理中面临显著成本挑战，现有稀疏注意力方法仅限于单上下文场景，无法处理RAG中多上下文KV Cache缺乏交叉注意力的问题

Method: SamKV在稀疏化一个上下文时考虑其他上下文的互补信息，然后对稀疏化信息进行局部重计算，实现多上下文KV Cache的高效压缩

Result: 实验表明该方法将序列长度压缩至15%，相比完全重计算基线无精度损失，显著提升了多上下文RAG场景的吞吐量

Conclusion: SamKV有效解决了多上下文KV Cache的稀疏化问题，为RAG场景提供了高效推理解决方案

Abstract: Large language models face significant cost challenges in long-sequence
inference. To address this, reusing historical Key-Value (KV) Cache for
improved inference efficiency has become a mainstream approach. Recent advances
further enhance throughput by sparse attention mechanisms to select the most
relevant KV Cache, thereby reducing sequence length. However, such techniques
are limited to single-context scenarios, where historical KV Cache is computed
sequentially with causal-attention dependencies. In retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) scenarios, where retrieved documents as context are unknown
beforehand, each document's KV Cache is computed and stored independently
(termed multiple-context KV Cache), lacking cross-attention between contexts.
This renders existing methods ineffective. Although prior work partially
recomputes multiple-context KV Cache to mitigate accuracy loss from missing
cross-attention, it requires retaining all KV Cache throughout, failing to
reduce memory overhead. This paper presents SamKV, the first exploration of
attention sparsification for multiple-context KV Cache. Specifically, SamKV
takes into account the complementary information of other contexts when
sparsifying one context, and then locally recomputes the sparsified
information. Experiments demonstrate that our method compresses sequence length
to 15% without accuracy degradation compared with full-recompuation baselines,
significantly boosting throughput in multi-context RAG scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗文本防御方法通常是攻击特定的或需要昂贵的模型重新训练，需要一个模型无关的检测框架来应对持续存在的对抗文本攻击威胁。

Method: RS框架首先使用重要性启发式对词汇排序，然后通过掩码top-k关键词汇测量嵌入敏感性，最后使用BiLSTM检测器处理结果模式。使用NDCG衡量扰动识别质量。

Result: 在三个数据集、三种攻击类型和两个受害者模型上，RS达到超过88%的检测准确率，计算成本较低。基于梯度的排序方法优于注意力和随机选择方法。

Conclusion: RS框架能够很好地泛化到未见过的数据集、攻击和模型，无需重新训练，为对抗文本检测提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attacks remain a persistent threat to transformer models,
yet existing defenses are typically attack-specific or require costly model
retraining. We introduce Representation Stability (RS), a model-agnostic
detection framework that identifies adversarial examples by measuring how
embedding representations change when important words are masked. RS first
ranks words using importance heuristics, then measures embedding sensitivity to
masking top-k critical words, and processes the resulting patterns with a
BiLSTM detector. Experiments show that adversarially perturbed words exhibit
disproportionately high masking sensitivity compared to naturally important
words. Across three datasets, three attack types, and two victim models, RS
achieves over 88% detection accuracy and demonstrates competitive performance
compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, often at lower computational
cost. Using Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) to measure
perturbation identification quality, we reveal that gradient-based ranking
outperforms attention and random selection approaches, with identification
quality correlating with detection performance for word-level attacks. RS also
generalizes well to unseen datasets, attacks, and models without retraining,
providing a practical solution for adversarial text detection.

Abstract: Noninvasive arterial blood pressure (ABP) monitoring is essential for patient
management in critical care and perioperative settings, providing continuous
assessment of cardiovascular hemodynamics with minimal risks. Numerous deep
learning models have developed to reconstruct ABP waveform from noninvasively
acquired physiological signals such as electrocardiogram and
photoplethysmogram. However, limited research has addressed the issue of model
performance and computational load for deployment on embedded systems. The
study introduces a lightweight sInvResUNet, along with a collaborative learning
scheme named KDCL_sInvResUNet. With only 0.89 million parameters and a
computational load of 0.02 GFLOPS, real-time ABP estimation was successfully
achieved on embedded devices with an inference time of just 8.49 milliseconds
for a 10-second output. We performed subject-independent validation in a
large-scale and heterogeneous perioperative dataset containing 1,257,141 data
segments from 2,154 patients, with a wide BP range (41-257 mmHg for SBP, and
31-234 mmHg for DBP). The proposed KDCL_sInvResUNet achieved lightly better
performance compared to large models, with a mean absolute error of 10.06 mmHg
and mean Pearson correlation of 0.88 in tracking ABP changes. Despite these
promising results, all deep learning models showed significant performance
variations across different demographic and cardiovascular conditions,
highlighting their limited ability to generalize across such a broad and
diverse population. This study lays a foundation work for real-time,
unobtrusive ABP monitoring in real-world perioperative settings, providing
baseline for future advancements in this area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了MSLoRA-CR方法，通过模态特定的LoRA模块和对比正则化来解决多模态生物医学图像增量学习中的知识保留和跨模态知识迁移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态生物医学图像增量学习(MBIIL)对于处理生物医学领域的不同任务和模态至关重要，因为为每个模态或任务训练单独的模型会显著增加推理成本。现有增量学习方法主要关注单一模态内的任务扩展，而MBIIL需要在跨模态场景下训练统一模型

Method: MSLoRA-CR方法基于大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)，保持预训练模型冻结，同时为每个模态或任务增量适配新的LoRA模块。通过对比正则化增强模态内知识共享并促进模态间知识区分

Result: 在生物医学图像增量学习实验中，MSLoRA-CR在整体性能上比无约束增量学习方法提高了1.88%，同时保持了计算效率，优于为每个模态训练单独模型的最先进方法和通用增量学习方法

Conclusion: MSLoRA-CR方法有效解决了MBIIL的两个核心挑战：知识保留和跨模态知识迁移，为多模态生物医学图像分析提供了一种高效统一的增量学习解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Biomedical Image Incremental Learning (MBIIL) is essential for
handling diverse tasks and modalities in the biomedical domain, as training
separate models for each modality or task significantly increases inference
costs. Existing incremental learning methods focus on task expansion within a
single modality, whereas MBIIL seeks to train a unified model incrementally
across modalities. The MBIIL faces two challenges: I) How to preserve
previously learned knowledge during incremental updates? II) How to effectively
leverage knowledge acquired from existing modalities to support new modalities?
To address these challenges, we propose MSLoRA-CR, a method that fine-tunes
Modality-Specific LoRA modules while incorporating Contrastive Regularization
to enhance intra-modality knowledge sharing and promote inter-modality
knowledge differentiation. Our approach builds upon a large vision-language
model (LVLM), keeping the pretrained model frozen while incrementally adapting
new LoRA modules for each modality or task. Experiments on the incremental
learning of biomedical images demonstrate that MSLoRA-CR outperforms both the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach of training separate models for each modality
and the general incremental learning method (incrementally fine-tuning LoRA).
Specifically, MSLoRA-CR achieves a 1.88% improvement in overall performance
compared to unconstrained incremental learning methods while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/VentusAislant/MSLoRA_CR.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种终身学习框架，通过Transformer网络和上下文调度器，让神经解法器能够增量学习解决不同场景下的车辆路由问题，提升了模型的适用性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经解法器通常在单一场景下训练，如使用欧几里得距离和固定问题规模，导致在不同场景下应用效果不佳。需要提升解法器的多样性和适用性。

Method: 设计了一个终身学习者(LL)，使用Transformer网络作为核心，通过上下文自注意力机制进行知识转移。还开发了动态上下文调度器(DCS)，利用跨上下文经验重放技术来回顾学到的解决策略。

Result: 在合成和标准数据集上（问题规模达18k）进行了广泛实验，结果显示该方法能够发现有效的策略来处理不同场景下的VRP问题，性能超过其他神经解法器，在大部分VRP问题上达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该终身学习框架通过知识转移和经验重放技术，有效提升了神经解法器在不同车辆路由问题场景下的适用性和性能，为解决复杂实际问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively explored to solve vehicle routing problems
(VRPs), which yields a range of data-driven neural solvers with promising
outcomes. However, most neural solvers are trained to tackle VRP instances in a
relatively monotonous context, e.g., simplifying VRPs by using Euclidean
distance between nodes and adhering to a single problem size, which harms their
off-the-shelf application in different scenarios. To enhance their versatility,
this paper presents a novel lifelong learning framework that incrementally
trains a neural solver to manage VRPs in distinct contexts. Specifically, we
propose a lifelong learner (LL), exploiting a Transformer network as the
backbone, to solve a series of VRPs. The inter-context self-attention mechanism
is proposed within LL to transfer the knowledge obtained from solving preceding
VRPs into the succeeding ones. On top of that, we develop a dynamic context
scheduler (DCS), employing the cross-context experience replay to further
facilitate LL looking back on the attained policies of solving preceding VRPs.
Extensive results on synthetic and benchmark instances (problem sizes up to
18k) show that our LL is capable of discovering effective policies for tackling
generic VRPs in varying contexts, which outperforms other neural solvers and
achieves the best performance for most VRPs.

Abstract: Demographic shifts, influenced by globalization, economic conditions,
geopolitical events, and environmental factors, pose significant challenges for
policymakers and researchers. Accurate demographic forecasting is essential for
informed decision-making in areas such as urban planning, healthcare, and
economic policy. This study explores the application of time series foundation
models to predict demographic changes in the United States using datasets from
the U.S. Census Bureau and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). We evaluate
the performance of the Time Series Foundation Model (TimesFM) against
traditional baselines including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Linear Regression. Our
experiments across six demographically diverse states demonstrate that TimesFM
achieves the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in 86.67% of test cases, with
particularly strong performance on minority populations with sparse historical
data. These findings highlight the potential of pre-trained foundation models
to enhance demographic analysis and inform proactive policy interventions
without requiring extensive task-specific fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统站点规划依赖经验判断和单一数据源，无法系统性量化多功能布局，需要数据驱动的结构化分析框架

Method: 构建SPLI系统，整合OSM、POI、建筑形态、土地利用和卫星影像等多源数据，包含五大维度：层次化功能分类、空间组织模式、功能多样性、基础服务可达性、土地利用强度，使用RGNN和GNN等深度学习方法补充数据缺口

Conclusion: SPLI系统通过多源数据整合和多维度量化，有效解决了传统规划方法的局限性，为城市空间规划提供了更科学、系统的分析工具和标准化基础

Abstract: The spatial layout of urban sites shapes land-use efficiency and spatial
organization. Traditional site planning often relies on experiential judgment
and single-source data, limiting systematic quantification of multifunctional
layouts. We propose a Site Planning Layout Indicator (SPLI) system, a
data-driven framework integrating empirical knowledge with heterogeneous
multi-source data to produce structured urban spatial information. The SPLI
supports multimodal spatial data systems for analytics, inference, and
retrieval by combining OpenStreetMap (OSM), Points of Interest (POI), building
morphology, land use, and satellite imagery. It extends conventional metrics
through five dimensions: (1) Hierarchical Building Function Classification,
refining empirical systems into clear hierarchies; (2) Spatial Organization,
quantifying seven layout patterns (e.g., symmetrical, concentric,
axial-oriented); (3) Functional Diversity, transforming qualitative assessments
into measurable indicators using Functional Ratio (FR) and Simpson Index (SI);
(4) Accessibility to Essential Services, integrating facility distribution and
transport networks for comprehensive accessibility metrics; and (5) Land Use
Intensity, using Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and Building Coverage Ratio (BCR) to
assess utilization efficiency. Data gaps are addressed through deep learning,
including Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNN) and Graph Neural Networks
(GNN). Experiments show the SPLI improves functional classification accuracy
and provides a standardized basis for automated, data-driven urban spatial
analytics.

Motivation: 现实世界系统往往只有部分被观测，存在潜在子过程，这对现有的因果结构发现方法提出了重大挑战。现有方法主要关注观测到的子过程之间的因果结构，而忽略了潜在子过程的影响。

Method: 将连续时间事件序列表示为离散时间模型，建立识别潜在子过程和因果影响的充要条件。提出两阶段迭代算法：交替推断已发现子过程间的因果关系和发现新的潜在子过程，通过基于路径的条件保证可识别性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在存在潜在子过程的情况下能够有效恢复因果结构。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理多元霍克斯过程中的潜在子过程问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过离散时间表示和路径条件保证了因果结构的可识别性，在复杂系统中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Multivariate Hawkes process provides a powerful framework for modeling
temporal dependencies and event-driven interactions in complex systems. While
existing methods primarily focus on uncovering causal structures among observed
subprocesses, real-world systems are often only partially observed, with latent
subprocesses posing significant challenges. In this paper, we show that
continuous-time event sequences can be represented by a discrete-time model as
the time interval shrinks, and we leverage this insight to establish necessary
and sufficient conditions for identifying latent subprocesses and the causal
influences. Accordingly, we propose a two-phase iterative algorithm that
alternates between inferring causal relationships among discovered subprocesses
and uncovering new latent subprocesses, guided by path-based conditions that
guarantee identifiability. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our method effectively recovers causal structures despite
the presence of latent subprocesses.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种受脑细胎启发的特征融合框架BRIEF，通过改进神经网络连接搜索策略和Transformer融合模块，在精神分裂症和孤独谱系障碍识别中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的fMRI分类深度学习模型在网络架构确定上依赖经验，特征融合方式简单（主要是拼接），缺乏相互学习机制。受人脑通过学习和决策更新神经连接的机制启发，需要更有效的特征融合方法。

Method: 1. 提取4种fMRI时间表征：时间序列、静态/动态功能连接、多尺度分散熵 2. 使用改进Q学习动态优化神经网络连接搜索（NCS），将NCS形式化为马尔可夫决策过程 3. 通过Transformer模块融合所有特征向量，利用稳定/时变连接和多尺度依赖关系 4. 嵌入注意力模块提高可解释性

Result: 在精神分裂症（SZ，n=1100）和孤独谱系障碍（ASD，n=1550）识别任务中，与21个最新模型相比，BRIEF实现了2.2%到12.1%的显著性能提升： SZ：AUC 91.5% ± 0.6% ASD：AUC 78.4% ± 0.5%

Conclusion: 这是首次将脑细胎启发的强化学习策略应用于fMRI基于精神障碍分类，显示了在识别精确神经影像生物标记物方面的重要潜力。

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for functional MRI-based classification have
limitations in network architecture determination (relying on experience) and
feature space fusion (mostly simple concatenation, lacking mutual learning).
Inspired by the human brain's mechanism of updating neural connections through
learning and decision-making, we proposed a novel BRain-Inspired feature Fusion
(BRIEF) framework, which is able to optimize network architecture automatically
by incorporating an improved neural network connection search (NCS) strategy
and a Transformer-based multi-feature fusion module. Specifically, we first
extracted 4 types of fMRI temporal representations, i.e., time series (TCs),
static/dynamic functional connection (FNC/dFNC), and multi-scale dispersion
entropy (MsDE), to construct four encoders. Within each encoder, we employed a
modified Q-learning to dynamically optimize the NCS to extract high-level
feature vectors, where the NCS is formulated as a Markov Decision Process.
Then, all feature vectors were fused via a Transformer, leveraging both
stable/time-varying connections and multi-scale dependencies across different
brain regions to achieve the final classification. Additionally, an attention
module was embedded to improve interpretability. The classification performance
of our proposed BRIEF was compared with 21 state-of-the-art models by
discriminating two mental disorders from healthy controls: schizophrenia (SZ,
n=1100) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n=1550). BRIEF demonstrated
significant improvements of 2.2% to 12.1% compared to 21 algorithms, reaching
an AUC of 91.5% - 0.6% for SZ and 78.4% - 0.5% for ASD, respectively. This is
the first attempt to incorporate a brain-inspired, reinforcement learning
strategy to optimize fMRI-based mental disorder classification, showing
significant potential for identifying precise neuroimaging biomarkers.

Abstract: High-quality labeled geospatial datasets are essential for extracting
insights and understanding our planet. Unfortunately, these datasets often do
not span the entire globe and are limited to certain geographic regions where
data was collected. Google DeepMind's recently released AlphaEarth Foundations
(AEF) provides an information-dense global geospatial representation designed
to serve as a useful input across a wide gamut of tasks. In this article we
propose and evaluate a methodology which leverages AEF to extend geospatial
labeled datasets beyond their initial geographic regions. We show that even
basic models like random forests or logistic regression can be used to
accomplish this task. We investigate a case study of extending LANDFIRE's
Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) dataset beyond the USA into Canada at two levels
of granularity: EvtPhys (13 classes) and EvtGp (80 classes). Qualitatively, for
EvtPhys, model predictions align with ground truth. Trained models achieve 81%
and 73% classification accuracy on EvtPhys validation sets in the USA and
Canada, despite discussed limitations.

Conclusion: 通过序列化初始化和自适应聚合的多阶段方法，为多样化TinyML网络部署高性能智能提供了稳健途径。

Abstract: Real-time fault classification in resource-constrained Internet of Things
(IoT) devices is critical for industrial safety, yet training robust models in
such heterogeneous environments remains a significant challenge. Standard
Federated Learning (FL) often fails in the presence of non-IID data, leading to
model divergence. This paper introduces Fed-Meta-Align, a novel four-phase
framework designed to overcome these limitations through a sophisticated
initialization and training pipeline. Our process begins by training a
foundational model on a general public dataset to establish a competent
starting point. This model then undergoes a serial meta-initialization phase,
where it sequentially trains on a subset of IOT Device data to learn a
heterogeneity-aware initialization that is already situated in a favorable
region of the loss landscape. This informed model is subsequently refined in a
parallel FL phase, which utilizes a dual-criterion aggregation mechanism that
weights for IOT devices updates based on both local performance and cosine
similarity alignment. Finally, an on-device personalization phase adapts the
converged global model into a specialized expert for each IOT Device.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Fed-Meta-Align achieves an average
test accuracy of 91.27% across heterogeneous IOT devices, outperforming
personalized FedAvg and FedProx by up to 3.87% and 3.37% on electrical and
mechanical fault datasets, respectively. This multi-stage approach of sequenced
initialization and adaptive aggregation provides a robust pathway for deploying
high-performance intelligence on diverse TinyML networks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven remarkably effective at improving the
accuracy of language models in verifiable and deterministic domains like
mathematics. Here, we examine if current RL methods are also effective at
optimizing language models in verifiable domains with stochastic outcomes, like
scientific experiments. Through applications to synthetic data and real-world
biological experiments, we demonstrate that Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) induces overconfident probability predictions for binary stochastic
outcomes, while Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and REINFORCE Leave-One-Out
(RLOO) yield well-calibrated models. We show that removing group standard
normalization in GRPO fixes its miscalibration and provide a theoretical
explanation for why normalization causes overconfidence. Our results provide
new evidence against the use of standard normalization in GRPO and help pave
the way for applications of RL for reasoning language models beyond
deterministic domains.

Abstract: Generating synthetic data is crucial in privacy-sensitive, data-scarce
settings, especially for tabular datasets widely used in real-world
applications. A key challenge is improving counterfactual and causal fairness,
while preserving high utility. We present FairTabGen, a fairness-aware large
language model-based framework for tabular synthetic data generation. We
integrate multiple fairness definitions including counterfactual and causal
fairness into both its generation and evaluation pipelines. We use in-context
learning, prompt refinement, and fairness-aware data curation to balance
fairness and utility. Across diverse datasets, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods, achieving up to 10%
improvements on fairness metrics such as demographic parity and path-specific
causal effects while retaining statistical utility. Remarkably, it achieves
these gains using less than 20% of the original data, highlighting its
efficiency in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate a principled and
practical approach for generating fair and useful synthetic tabular data.

Abstract: For years, many neural networks have been developed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem (KART), which was created to address
Hilbert's 13th problem. Recently, relying on KART, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) have attracted attention from the research community, stimulating the
use of polynomial functions such as B-splines and RBFs. However, these
functions are not fully supported by GPU devices and are still considered less
popular. In this paper, we propose the use of fast computational functions,
such as ReLU and trigonometric functions (e.g., ReLU, sin, cos, arctan), as
basis components in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). By integrating these
function combinations into the network structure, we aim to enhance
computational efficiency. Experimental results show that these combinations
maintain competitive performance while offering potential improvements in
training time and generalization.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了PCA和SVM层在CNN中的可视化问题，为开发白盒分类方法提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an effective approach for
classification tasks, particularly when the training dataset is large. Although
CNNs have long been considered a black-box classification method, they can be
used as a white-box method through visualization techniques such as Grad-CAM.
When training samples are limited, incorporating a Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) layer and/or a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier into a CNN can
effectively improve classification performance. However, traditional Grad-CAM
cannot be directly applied to PCA and/or SVM layers. It is important to
generate attention regions for PCA and/or SVM layers in CNNs to facilitate the
development of white-box methods. Therefore, we propose ``PCA-Grad-CAM'', a
method for visualizing attention regions in PCA feature vectors, and
``SVM-Grad-CAM'', a method for visualizing attention regions in an SVM
classifier layer. To complete our methods analytically, it is necessary to
solve the closed-form Jacobian consisting of partial derivatives from the last
convolutional layer to the PCA and/or SVM layers. In this paper, we present the
exact closed-form Jacobian and the visualization results of our methods applied
to several major datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 较于Transformer，需要更高效的架构来建模长序列高阶数据，特别是将原本设计用于语言建模的线性循环模型扩展到高阶数据的方法。

Method: 研究了扫描策略和注意力混合架构两个关键方面，重点分析了注意力类型，发现磕装高阶滑动窗口注意力（SWA）在理论和实践中都很高效，并将其与线性循环结合构成ENA架构。

Result: 实验结果显示扫描策略提供的改善有限，而注意力混合模型呈现出艰望的结果，尤其是使用滑动窗口注意力的ENA架构在超长高阶数据建模中表现出艰望的效果。

Conclusion: 线性循环将全局信息压缩到状态中，而滑动窗口注意力通过强化严格的局部建模来补充它们，共同构成了一个简单的框架，为超长高阶数据建模提供了有前景的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient modeling of long sequences of high-order data requires a more
efficient architecture than Transformer. In this paper, we investigate two key
aspects of extending linear recurrent models, especially those originally
designed for language modeling, to high-order data (1D to ND): scanning
strategies and attention-hybrid architectures. Empirical results suggest that
scanning provides limited benefits, while attention-hybrid models yield
promising results. Focusing on the latter, we further evaluate types of
attention and find that tiled high-order sliding window attention (SWA) is
efficient in both theory and practice. We term the resulting hybrid
architecture of linear recurrence and high-order SWA as Efficient N-dimensional
Attention (ENA). We then conduct several experiments to demonstrate its
effectiveness. The intuition behind ENA is that linear recurrence compresses
global information into a state, while SWA complements it by enforcing strict
local modeling. Together, they form a simple framework that offers a promising
and practical solution for ultra-long high-order data modeling.

Conclusion: SDSTM框架通过有效解耦多尺度时空特征并使其保持独立但补充的关系，显著提高了长期交通排放预测的准确性，为城市空气污染综合管理提供了有效觤决方案

Abstract: Long-term traffic emission forecasting is crucial for the comprehensive
management of urban air pollution. Traditional forecasting methods typically
construct spatiotemporal graph models by mining spatiotemporal dependencies to
predict emissions. However, due to the multi-scale entanglement of traffic
emissions across time and space, these spatiotemporal graph modeling method
tend to suffer from cascading error amplification during long-term inference.
To address this issue, we propose a Scale-Disentangled Spatio-Temporal Modeling
(SDSTM) framework for long-term traffic emission forecasting. It leverages the
predictability differences across multiple scales to decompose and fuse
features at different scales, while constraining them to remain independent yet
complementary. Specifically, the model first introduces a dual-stream feature
decomposition strategy based on the Koopman lifting operator. It lifts the
scale-coupled spatiotemporal dynamical system into an infinite-dimensional
linear space via Koopman operator, and delineates the predictability boundary
using gated wavelet decomposition. Then a novel fusion mechanism is
constructed, incorporating a dual-stream independence constraint based on
cross-term loss to dynamically refine the dual-stream prediction results,
suppress mutual interference, and enhance the accuracy of long-term traffic
emission prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a road-level traffic
emission dataset within Xi'an's Second Ring Road demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an efficient algorithm for linear contextual bandits with
adversarial losses and stochastic action sets. Our approach reduces this
setting to misspecification-robust adversarial linear bandits with fixed action
sets. Without knowledge of the context distribution or access to a context
simulator, the algorithm achieves $\tilde{O}(\min\{d^2\sqrt{T}, \sqrt{d^3T\log
K}\})$ regret and runs in $\text{poly}(d,C,T)$ time, where $d$ is the feature
dimension, $C$ is an upper bound on the number of linear constraints defining
the action set in each round, $K$ is an upper bound on the number of actions in
each round, and $T$ is number of rounds. This resolves the open question by Liu
et al. (2023) on whether one can obtain $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$ regret in
polynomial time independent of the number of actions. For the important class
of combinatorial bandits with adversarial losses and stochastic action sets
where the action sets can be described by a polynomial number of linear
constraints, our algorithm is the first to achieve $\text{poly}(d)\sqrt{T}$
regret in polynomial time, while no prior algorithm achieves even $o(T)$ regret
in polynomial time to our knowledge. When a simulator is available, the regret
bound can be improved to $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{L^\star})$, where $L^\star$ is the
cumulative loss of the best policy.

<details>

Motivation: 解决多模态环境下OOD检测器选择难题，由于OOD检测的无监督特性和新数据评估成本高，需要自动化选择方法。

Method: 结合多模态嵌入和手工设计的元特征来表示数据集，利用元学习从历史性能数据中学习，快速适应新的分布偏移。

Result: 在12个测试场景中持续优于10个竞争基线方法，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: M3OOD为多模态OOD检测提供了有效的自动化选择方案，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness is a critical challenge for modern
machine learning systems, particularly as they increasingly operate in
multimodal settings involving inputs like video, audio, and sensor data.
Currently, many OOD detection methods have been proposed, each with different
designs targeting various distribution shifts. A single OOD detector may not
prevail across all the scenarios; therefore, how can we automatically select an
ideal OOD detection model for different distribution shifts? Due to the
inherent unsupervised nature of the OOD detection task, it is difficult to
predict model performance and find a universally Best model. Also,
systematically comparing models on the new unseen data is costly or even
impractical. To address this challenge, we introduce M3OOD, a
meta-learning-based framework for OOD detector selection in multimodal
settings. Meta learning offers a solution by learning from historical model
behaviors, enabling rapid adaptation to new data distribution shifts with
minimal supervision. Our approach combines multimodal embeddings with
handcrafted meta-features that capture distributional and cross-modal
characteristics to represent datasets. By leveraging historical performance
across diverse multimodal benchmarks, M3OOD can recommend suitable detectors
for a new data distribution shift. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that
M3OOD consistently outperforms 10 competitive baselines across 12 test
scenarios with minimal computational overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于直通估计器(STE)框架的噪声感知训练方法，通过解耦前向噪声模拟和后向梯度计算，解决了模拟计算内存(CIM)系统中复杂硬件噪声的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟CIM架构虽然能显著提升神经网络推理的能效，但复杂的硬件噪声给部署带来重大挑战。现有的噪声感知训练方法依赖理想化且可微分的噪声模型，无法捕捉模拟CIM硬件变化的全部复杂性。

Method: 借鉴量化中的直通估计器(STE)框架，将前向噪声模拟与后向梯度计算解耦，使得能够使用更准确但计算上难以处理的噪声模型进行噪声感知训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像分类上实现5.3%的准确率提升，文本生成上降低0.72困惑度，训练时间加速2.2倍，峰值内存使用降低37.9%。

Conclusion: 扩展的STE框架为模拟CIM系统提供了有效的噪声感知训练解决方案，在保持计算可行性和优化稳定性的同时，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Analog Compute-In-Memory (CIM) architectures promise significant energy
efficiency gains for neural network inference, but suffer from complex
hardware-induced noise that poses major challenges for deployment. While
noise-aware training methods have been proposed to address this issue, they
typically rely on idealized and differentiable noise models that fail to
capture the full complexity of analog CIM hardware variations. Motivated by the
Straight-Through Estimator (STE) framework in quantization, we decouple forward
noise simulation from backward gradient computation, enabling noise-aware
training with more accurate but computationally intractable noise modeling in
analog CIM systems. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that our
approach preserves essential gradient directional information while maintaining
computational tractability and optimization stability. Extensive experiments
show that our extended STE framework achieves up to 5.3% accuracy improvement
on image classification, 0.72 perplexity reduction on text generation,
2.2$\times$ speedup in training time, and 37.9% lower peak memory usage
compared to standard noise-aware training methods.

Motivation: 神经网络MTPP模型在高风险应用中广泛使用，但其输出的可信度存在担忧，需要找到能够解释预测结果的最小历史事件子集。

Method: 提出CFF方法，结合反事实和事实解释，通过精心设计的技术来解决MTPP的解释问题。

Result: 实验证明CFF在解释质量和处理效率方面优于基线方法，具有正确性和优越性。

Conclusion: CFF方法有效解决了MTPP模型的解释问题，提供了更可信和理性的解释方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models have been
widely adopted to model event sequences in high-stakes applications, raising
concerns about the trustworthiness of outputs from these models. This study
focuses on Explanation for MTPP, aiming to identify the minimal and rational
explanation, that is, the minimum subset of events in history, based on which
the prediction accuracy of MTPP matches that based on full history to a great
extent and better than that based on the complement of the subset. This study
finds that directly defining Explanation for MTPP as counterfactual explanation
or factual explanation can result in irrational explanations. To address this
issue, we define Explanation for MTPP as a combination of counterfactual
explanation and factual explanation. This study proposes Counterfactual and
Factual Explainer for MTPP (CFF) to solve Explanation for MTPP with a series of
deliberately designed techniques. Experiments demonstrate the correctness and
superiority of CFF over baselines regarding explanation quality and processing
efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN)来解决高排放车辆识别中的长尾分布问题，通过transformer学习时间相似性和集合值识别算法，在合肥柴油车数据上实现了9.5%的漏检率降低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际监测数据中高排放状态数据比例远低于正常排放状态，这种长尾分布特征严重阻碍了排放状态识别中判别性特征的提取，同时排放状态的高度非线性和先验知识缺乏也给模型构建带来挑战

Method: 使用transformer测量微行程条件变化的时间相似性，构建从高维排放数据到低维特征空间的映射规则；采用集合值识别算法对特征向量与标签关系进行概率建模，为分类算法提供准确度量标准

Result: 在合肥市2020年柴油车监测数据上的实验表明，相比基于transformer的基线方法，该方法将高排放车辆的漏检率降低了9.5%

Conclusion: SVTN方法能够有效学习高排放样本的判别性特征，显著提高高排放移动污染源的准确识别能力

Abstract: Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban
pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies.
However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state
data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This
characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of
discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining.
Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the
lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the
construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we
propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive
learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby
enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the
transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition
variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original
high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a
set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the
relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing
an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on
the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection
rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline,
highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission
mobile pollution sources.

TL;DR: LoRA模块可以通过简单加法组合，无需额外训练即可实现多领域适配，性能接近合并数据训练的效果，并揭示了高阶组合中的干扰现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于叠加原理的假设，研究独立训练的LoRA模块在不相交领域上的正交性，探索通过简单加法组合这些模块的可能性。

Method: 使用GPT-2 Small模型，LoRA秩为4，alpha=64，在三个QA领域（数学、医学、金融）上独立训练适配器，然后通过简单加法组合这些LoRA模块。

Result: 数学+医学组合相对合并数据微调困惑度改善-9.10%，数学+金融和金融+医学组合分别变化+4.54%和+27.56%。LoRA delta之间的RMS余弦相似度与困惑度变化呈正相关线性关系。

Conclusion: 朴素加法方法无需额外训练，可在秒级完成，性能与合并数据训练模型相当，同时揭示了高阶组合中出现干扰的条件。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models are driven by scale, while
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) enables updating only a small fraction
of parameters. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stores parameter deltas as the
product of two small matrices, which makes them natural building blocks that
can be composed. Motivated by the superposition principle, we hypothesize that
independently trained LoRA modules on disjoint domains are approximately
orthogonal and can be combined by simple addition. Using GPT-2 Small (117M)
with LoRA rank 4 and alpha=64, we train adapters for three QA domains (math,
medicine, finance). In pairwise tests, adding Math+Medicine adapters improves
perplexity by -9.10% relative to merged-data fine-tuning, while Math+Finance
and Finance+Medicine change by +4.54% and +27.56%, respectively. Across
combinations, the RMS cosine similarity between LoRA deltas correlates
positively and approximately linearly with the change in perplexity. Naive
summation requires no additional training, can be applied in seconds, and
achieves performance comparable to models trained on merged data, while
clarifying when interference appears in higher-order compositions.

Conclusion: 该方法显著推广了原始谱滤波算法，能够处理非对称动态和噪声校正，对线性动力系统的谱滤波有独立的理论价值

Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning a marginally stable unknown
nonlinear dynamical system. We describe an algorithm for this problem, based on
the technique of spectral filtering, which learns a mapping from past
observations to the next based on a spectral representation of the system.
Using techniques from online convex optimization, we prove vanishing prediction
error for any nonlinear dynamical system that has finitely many marginally
stable modes, with rates governed by a novel quantitative control-theoretic
notion of learnability. The main technical component of our method is a new
spectral filtering algorithm for linear dynamical systems, which incorporates
past observations and applies to general noisy and marginally stable systems.
This significantly generalizes the original spectral filtering algorithm to
both asymmetric dynamics as well as incorporating noise correction, and is of
independent interest.

Motivation: 解决无监督联邦学习中的三个主要挑战：非独立同分布数据、边缘设备的高计算通信成本、通信噪声脆弱性。传统基于神经网络的方法存在计算和通信开销大的问题。

Method: 基于超维度计算（HDC）构建框架，客户端使用kNN聚类超向量移除方法处理非iid数据，服务器端采用加权HDC聚合技术平衡数据分布。

Conclusion: HDC-based FedUHD框架为无监督联邦学习提供了高效、轻量且鲁棒的解决方案，在多个关键指标上显著优于现有神经网络方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised federated learning (UFL) has gained attention as a
privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning approach that eliminates the
need for labor-intensive data labeling. However, UFL faces several challenges
in practical applications: (1) non-independent and identically distributed
(non-iid) data distribution across devices, (2) expensive computational and
communication costs at the edge, and (3) vulnerability to communication noise.
Previous UFL approaches have relied on deep neural networks (NN), which
introduce substantial overhead in both computation and communication. In this
paper, we propose FedUHD, the first UFL framework based on Hyperdimensional
Computing (HDC). HDC is a brain-inspired computing scheme with lightweight
training and inference operations, much smaller model size, and robustness to
communication noise. FedUHD introduces two novel HDC-based designs to improve
UFL performance. On the client side, a kNN-based cluster hypervector removal
method addresses non-iid data samples by eliminating detrimental outliers. On
the server side, a weighted HDC aggregation technique balances the non-iid data
distribution across clients. Our experiments demonstrate that FedUHD achieves
up to 173.6x and 612.7x better speedup and energy efficiency, respectively, in
training, up to 271x lower communication cost, and 15.50% higher accuracy on
average across diverse settings, along with superior robustness to various
types of noise compared to state-of-the-art NN-based UFL approaches.

Conclusion: 梯度方差正则化方法（FairGrad及其变体）是解决联邦学习中性能公平性问题的有效方法，特别是在数据异质环境下表现优异

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a vital paradigm in modern machine
learning that enables collaborative training across decentralized data sources
without exchanging raw data. This approach not only addresses privacy concerns
but also allows access to overall substantially larger and potentially more
diverse datasets, without the need for centralized storage or hardware
resources. However, heterogeneity in client data may cause certain clients to
have disproportionate impacts on the global model, leading to disparities in
the clients' performances. Fairness, therefore, becomes a crucial concern in FL
and can be addressed in various ways. However, the effectiveness of existing
fairness-aware methods, particularly in heterogeneous data settings, remains
unclear, and the relationships between different approaches are not well
understood. In this work, we focus on performance equitable fairness, which
aims to minimize differences in performance across clients. We restrict our
study to fairness-aware methods that explicitly regularize client losses,
evaluating both existing and newly proposed approaches. We identify and
theoretically explain connections between the investigated fairness methods,
and empirically show that FairGrad (approximate) and FairGrad* (exact) (two
variants of a gradient variance regularization method introduced here for
performance equitable fairness) improve both fairness and overall model
performance in heterogeneous data settings.

Abstract: Conventional methods for aggregating layers in fine-tuned self-supervised
speech models, such as using the final layer or weighted sum, suffer from
information bottlenecks and static feature weighting for all dataset examples.
We propose VARAN, a framework that dynamically tailors layer aggregation to

data-dependent weighting, VARAN adaptively prioritizes layer's features based
on input. Evaluations on automatic speech recognition and speech emotion
recognition tasks demonstrate VARAN's superior performance, particularly when
using the LoRA fine-tuning technique. The framework resolves the trade-off
between preserving layer-specific information and enabling flexible feature
utilization, advancing efficient adaptation of self-supervised speech
representations.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) can enhance artificial
intelligence-generated content (AIGC) networks by providing efficient sensing
and transmission. Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of
the generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,
thus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not
applicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on
inaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation
errors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing
resources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we
propose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).
Since allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content
accuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this
sensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource
tradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all
users with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution
space that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with
low complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the
LP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original
three-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while
improving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to
existing DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F
converges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,
improving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an
improvement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing
solely on CGQ.

Abstract: Realizing personalized medicine at scale calls for methods that distill
insights from longitudinal patient journeys, which can be viewed as a sequence
of medical events. Foundation models pretrained on large-scale medical event
data represent a promising direction for scaling real-world evidence generation
and generalizing to diverse downstream tasks. Using Epic Cosmos, a dataset with
medical events from de-identified longitudinal health records for 16.3 billion
encounters over 300 million unique patient records from 310 health systems, we
introduce the Cosmos Medical Event Transformer ( CoMET) models, a family of
decoder-only transformer models pretrained on 118 million patients representing
115 billion discrete medical events (151 billion tokens). We present the
largest scaling-law study for medical event data, establishing a methodology
for pretraining and revealing power-law scaling relationships for compute,
tokens, and model size. Based on this, we pretrained a series of
compute-optimal models with up to 1 billion parameters. Conditioned on a
patient's real-world history, CoMET autoregressively generates the next medical
event, simulating patient health timelines. We studied 78 real-world tasks,
including diagnosis prediction, disease prognosis, and healthcare operations.
Remarkably for a foundation model with generic pretraining and simulation-based
inference, CoMET generally outperformed or matched task-specific supervised
models on these tasks, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning or few-shot
examples. CoMET's predictive power consistently improves as the model and

TL;DR: DynamixSFT是一种动态自动化的指令调优数据集混合优化方法，通过多臂老虎机框架和先验缩放玻尔兹曼探索，在保持数据集多样性的同时实现性能提升2.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着后训练阶段大量指令调优数据集的出现，如何动态平衡和优化这些数据集的混合比例成为一个关键挑战。

Method: 将问题建模为多臂老虎机框架，提出先验缩放玻尔兹曼探索方法，使用轻量级1步前瞻奖励来更新采样概率，保持原始数据集比例的软锚定。

Result: 在包含16个指令调优数据集的Tulu-v2-mixture集合上，DynamixSFT在10个基准测试中实现了最高2.2%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效优化指令调优数据集的混合比例，在保持数据集多样性的同时显著提升模型性能，并提供对自适应动态的深入分析。

Abstract: As numerous instruction-tuning datasets continue to emerge during the
post-training stage, dynamically balancing and optimizing their mixtures has
become a critical challenge. To address this, we propose DynamixSFT, a dynamic
and automated method for instruction-tuning dataset mixture optimization. We
formulate the problem as a multi-armed bandit setup and introduce a
Prior-scaled Boltzmann Exploration that softly anchors the updated sampling
distribution to the original dataset proportions, thereby preserving the
inherent diversity and coverage of the collection. Sampling probabilities are
updated using a lightweight 1-Step Look-ahead Reward, reflecting how much the
dataset contributes to improving the model's performance at its current state.
When applied to the Tulu-v2-mixture collection comprising 16 instruction-tuning
datasets, DynamixSFT achieves up to a 2.2% performance improvement across 10
benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis and visualizations
to offer deeper insights into the adaptive dynamics of our method.

Motivation: 研究门控RNN中门控机制如何隐式地诱导自适应学习率行为，即使使用固定全局学习率训练时也能产生这种效果。

Method: 通过推导泄漏积分器和门控RNN的精确雅可比矩阵，获得一阶展开式，分析标量和多维门控如何重塑梯度传播、调节有效步长并引入参数更新的各向异性。

Result: 门控不仅控制隐藏状态中的记忆保留，还作为数据驱动的预处理器，自适应地调整参数空间中的优化轨迹，数值实验验证了微扰分析的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了统一的动力学系统视角，解释了门控如何耦合状态演化与参数更新，阐明了门控架构在实践中实现鲁棒可训练性和稳定性的原因。

Abstract: We study how gating mechanisms in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) implicitly
induce adaptive learning-rate behavior, even when training is carried out with
a fixed, global learning rate. This effect arises from the coupling between
state-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space
dynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for
leaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes
explicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient
propagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in
parameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control memory
retention in the hidden states, but also act as data-driven preconditioners
that adapt optimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal
analogies with learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as
Adam, showing that these optimization behaviors emerge naturally from gating.
Numerical experiments confirm the validity of our perturbative analysis,
supporting the view that gate-induced corrections remain small while exerting
systematic effects on training dynamics. Overall, this work provides a unified
dynamical-systems perspective on how gating couples state evolution with
parameter updates, explaining why gated architectures achieve robust
trainability and stability in practice.

TL;DR: DE-VAE是一种基于微分熵的不确定性感知变分自编码器，用于改进参数化和可逆投影，能处理分布外样本并分析嵌入不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自编码器在处理分布外样本时表现不佳，需要一种能够创建参数化、可逆投影并能分析不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用微分熵的变分自编码器，学习从原始空间到2D空间的映射及其逆映射，以UMAP和t-SNE作为基线方法进行比较。

Result: 在四个知名数据集上的定量和定性评估表明，DE-VAE在保持与其他AE方法相当精度的同时，能够分析嵌入不确定性。

Conclusion: DE-VAE成功实现了参数化和可逆投影，在处理分布外样本和不确定性分析方面表现出色，为多维数据投影提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, autoencoders (AEs) have gained interest for creating parametric and
invertible projections of multidimensional data. Parametric projections make it
possible to embed new, unseen samples without recalculating the entire
projection, while invertible projections allow the synthesis of new data
instances. However, existing methods perform poorly when dealing with
out-of-distribution samples in either the data or embedding space. Thus, we
propose DE-VAE, an uncertainty-aware variational AE using differential entropy
(DE) to improve the learned parametric and invertible projections. Given a
fixed projection, we train DE-VAE to learn a mapping into 2D space and an
inverse mapping back to the original space. We conduct quantitative and
qualitative evaluations on four well-known datasets, using UMAP and t-SNE as
baseline projection methods. Our findings show that DE-VAE can create
parametric and inverse projections with comparable accuracy to other current
AE-based approaches while enabling the analysis of embedding uncertainty.

Abstract: The paradigm of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has evolved into real-time
digital analysis, facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML), which has improved the diagnostic precision and predictive
capacity of cardiac diseases. This work proposes a novel deep learning (DL)
architecture called the attention-integrated convolutional residual network
(AICRN) to regress key ECG parameters such as the PR interval, the QT interval,
the QRS duration, the heart rate, the peak amplitude of the R wave, and the
amplitude of the T wave for interpretable ECG analysis. Our architecture is
specially designed with spatial and channel attention-related mechanisms to
address the type and spatial location of the ECG features for regression. The
models employ a convolutional residual network to address vanishing and
exploding gradient problems. The designed system addresses traditional analysis
challenges, such as loss of focus due to human errors, and facilitates the fast
and easy detection of cardiac events, thereby reducing the manual efforts
required to solve analysis tasks. AICRN models outperform existing models in
parameter regression with higher precision. This work demonstrates that DL can
play a crucial role in the interpretability and precision of ECG analysis,
opening up new clinical applications for cardiac monitoring and management.

TL;DR: ProtTeX-CC是一个轻量级的两阶段压缩框架，通过联合嵌入压缩和自压缩模块，有效减少蛋白质输入长度并提升在少样本设置下的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ProtTeX等蛋白质大语言模型中序列和结构标记拼接导致输入长度翻倍、破坏模态对齐，以及无法进行上下文学习的问题。

Method: 两阶段压缩：1）联合嵌入压缩机制在残基级别融合序列和结构表示；2）自压缩模块将完整演示聚合到潜在空间中，大幅减少标记数量。

Result: 在16-shot设置下实现约93.68%的总提示长度压缩比，域内基准性能提升2%，域外数据集性能提升11%。

Conclusion: ProtTeX-CC在不修改主干模型的情况下，通过少量额外参数显著提升了蛋白质功能预测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in protein large language models, such as ProtTeX, represent
both side-chain amino acids and backbone structure as discrete token sequences
of residue length. While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal
protein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The
concatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the
protein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between
modalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,
ProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it
incompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its
generalization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a
lightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under
few-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that
fuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively
reducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then
we propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration
into the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average
demonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the
original ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of
approximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.
Without modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number
of additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding
compression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the
self-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction
show that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and
generalizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可重现的系统方法来实现大语言模型的遗忘权（被遗忘权），通过记录训练过程的确定性日志，支持精确回放训练过程来删除特定数据，同时提供多种互补路径来满足延迟和可用性约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何实现GDPR第17条规定的被遗忘权，将遗忘问题构建为一个可重现的系统问题，确保模型能够从训练数据中删除特定信息。

Method: 将训练视为确定性程序，记录每个微批次的日志（包括ID哈希、RNG种子、学习率值、优化器步数计数器和累积边界）。在固定栈和确定性内核下，回放训练尾部同时过滤遗忘闭包，实现与在保留集上训练相同的参数。提供三种互补路径：精确回滚最近步骤、队列范围的适配器删除、以及曲率引导的反向更新加短时保留调优。

Result: 在满足前提条件的受控运行中，实现了模型和优化器状态的字节级完全相同。报告了存储/延迟预算，并通过玩具实验验证了机制的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模语言模型实现被遗忘权提供了一个系统化的解决方案，通过确定性训练记录和多种互补技术路径，能够在保证模型性能的同时满足法规要求。

Abstract: We study the right to be forgotten (GDPR Art. 17) for large language models
and frame unlearning as a reproducible systems problem. Our approach treats
training as a deterministic program and logs a minimal per-microbatch record
(ordered ID hash, RNG seed, learning-rate value, optimizer-step counter, and
accumulation boundary). Under a pinned stack and deterministic kernels,
replaying the training tail while filtering only the forget closure yields the
same parameters as training on the retain set (bit-identical in the training
dtype) when preconditions hold. To meet latency and availability constraints,
we add complementary paths: (i) exact reverts of recent steps via
micro-checkpoints or dense per-step deltas, (ii) cohort-scoped adapter deletion
when the base is frozen, and (iii) a curvature-guided anti-update followed by a
short retain-tune, audit-gated with escalation to exact replay. We report
storage/latency budgets and a toy artifact validating mechanics; in a
controlled run that satisfies the preconditions we demonstrate byte-identical
equality of model and optimizer states.

Result: 通过理论验证和在合成数据集、真实数据集上的实验证明了方法的性能

Conclusion: 该方法给分布匹配任务提供了一种更稳定、更易训练的GAN替代方案，合理结合了CNF和GAN的优势

Abstract: Recent advancement in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
performance across various data modalities. Beyond their typical use in data
synthesis, these models play a crucial role in distribution matching tasks such
as latent variable modeling, domain translation, and domain adaptation.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as the preferred method of
distribution matching due to their efficacy in handling high-dimensional data
and their flexibility in accommodating various constraints. However, GANs often
encounter challenge in training due to their bi-level min-max optimization
objective and susceptibility to mode collapse. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for distribution matching inspired by the consistency models employed
in Continuous Normalizing Flow (CNF). Our model inherits the advantages of CNF
models, such as having a straight forward norm minimization objective, while
remaining adaptable to different constraints similar to GANs. We provide
theoretical validation of our proposed objective and demonstrate its
performance through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 粗粗量化ADMM能够在保持收敛性的同时有效降低分布式优化的通信成本

Abstract: In distributed optimization and federated learning, asynchronous alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) serves as an attractive option for
large-scale optimization, data privacy, straggler nodes and variety of
objective functions. However, communication costs can become a major bottleneck
when the nodes have limited communication budgets or when the data to be
communicated is prohibitively large. In this work, we propose introducing
coarse quantization to the data to be exchanged in aynchronous ADMM so as to
reduce communication overhead for large-scale federated learning and
distributed optimization applications. We experimentally verify the convergence
of the proposed method for several distributed learning tasks, including neural
networks.

Abstract: With the success of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in various application
fields beyond natural language processing, language models have raised emerging
attention in the field of time series forecasting (TSF) and have shown great
prospects. However, current PLM-based TSF methods still fail to achieve
satisfactory prediction accuracy matching the strong sequential modeling power
of language models. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Model and
Cross-Modality Learning with PLMs for time series forecasting (CC-Time). We
explore the potential of PLMs for time series forecasting from two aspects: 1)
what time series features could be modeled by PLMs, and 2) whether relying
solely on PLMs is sufficient for building time series models. In the first
aspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal
dependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series
sequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,
CC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate
knowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive
modeling of time series patterns. Extensive experiments on nine real-world
datasets demonstrate that CC-Time achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy
in both full-data training and few-shot learning situations.

Abstract: Although conventional deep graph models have achieved great success in
relational learning, their focus on pairwise relationships limits their
capacity to learn pervasive higher-order interactions in real-world complex
systems, which can be naturally modeled as hypergraphs. To tackle this,
hypergraph neural networks (HNNs), the dominant approach in deep hypergraph
learning (DHGL), has garnered substantial attention in recent years. Despite
the proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for
HNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in
several aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;
(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent
dataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder
comparability. To fill the gap, we introduce DHG-Bench, the first comprehensive
benchmark for DHGL. Specifically, DHG-Bench integrates 20 diverse datasets
spanning node-, edge-, and graph-level tasks, along with 16 state-of-the-art
HNN algorithms, under consistent data processing and experimental protocols.
Our benchmark systematically investigates the characteristics of HNNs in terms
of four dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and fairness.
Further, to facilitate reproducible research, we have developed an easy-to-use
library for training and evaluating different HNN methods. Extensive
experiments conducted with DHG-Bench reveal both the strengths and inherent
limitations of existing algorithms, offering valuable insights and directions
for future research. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: 提出的STM2/STM3模型能够有效解决长期时空依赖学习问题，STM3通过改进的路由策略和对比学习进一步提升了性能

Abstract: Recently, spatio-temporal time-series prediction has developed rapidly, yet
existing deep learning methods struggle with learning complex long-term
spatio-temporal dependencies efficiently. The long-term spatio-temporal
dependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal
sequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract
efficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is
highly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an
efficient \textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ultiscale
\textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture
the multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive
graph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale
spatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation
for different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability. To
capture diverse temporal dynamics across all spatial nodes more efficiently, we
further propose an enhanced version termed
\textit{\textbf{S}patio-\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{M}ixture of
\textbf{M}ultiscale \textbf{M}amba} (STM3) that employs a special
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, including a more stable routing strategy and a
causal contrastive learning strategy to enhance the scale distinguishability.
We prove that STM3 has much better routing smoothness and guarantees the
pattern disentanglement for each expert successfully. Extensive experiments on
real-world benchmarks demonstrate STM2/STM3's superior performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results in long-term spatio-temporal time-series prediction.

Conclusion: 论文提供了一套完整的时间序列预测解释方法论，包括方法论基础、算法理论、实证评估和实践指南，为实践者提供了可靠的解释性工具。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting underpins critical decisions across aviation, energy,
retail and health. Classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
models offer interpretability via coefficients but struggle with
nonlinearities, whereas tree-based machine-learning models such as XGBoost
deliver high accuracy but are often opaque. This paper presents a unified
framework for interpreting time-series forecasts using local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley additive exPlanations (SHAP). We
convert a univariate series into a leakage-free supervised learning problem,
train a gradient-boosted tree alongside an ARIMA baseline and apply post-hoc
explainability. Using the Air Passengers dataset as a case study, we show that
a small set of lagged features -- particularly the twelve-month lag -- and
seasonal encodings explain most forecast variance. We contribute: (i) a
methodology for applying LIME and SHAP to time series without violating
chronology; (ii) theoretical exposition of the underlying algorithms; (iii)
empirical evaluation with extensive analysis; and (iv) guidelines for
practitioners.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning has achieved impressive results but remains limited
by its reliance on large labeled datasets, poor generalization to unseen
scenarios, and growing computational demands. In contrast, classical
optimization methods are data-efficient and lightweight but often suffer from
slow convergence. While learned optimizers offer a promising fusion of both
worlds, most focus on first-order methods, leaving learned second-order
approaches largely unexplored.
  We propose a novel learned second-order optimizer that introduces a trainable
preconditioning unit to enhance the classical Symmetric-Rank-One (SR1)
algorithm. This unit generates data-driven vectors used to construct positive
semi-definite rank-one matrices, aligned with the secant constraint via a
learned projection. Our method is evaluated through analytic experiments and on
the real-world task of Monocular Human Mesh Recovery (HMR), where it
outperforms existing learned optimization-based approaches. Featuring a
lightweight model and requiring no annotated data or fine-tuning, our approach
offers strong generalization and is well-suited for integration into broader
optimization-based frameworks.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used as the engine for various
graph-related tasks, with their effectiveness in analyzing graph-structured
data. However, training robust GNNs often demands abundant labeled data, which
is a critical bottleneck in real-world applications. This limitation severely
impedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are
inherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to
evade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring
Contrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by
jointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from
previous works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor
the context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the
attributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,
CRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the
message-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex
interaction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while
encouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover
intricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated
with the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness
unlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative
node embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with
varying scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CRoC achieves up to 14%
AUC improvement over baseline GNNs and outperforms state-of-the-art GAD methods
under limited-label settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了Lion优化器的收敛性能，包括标准版本、方差缩减版本以及分布式设置下的不同变体，并提出了各自的收敛率理论结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Lion优化器的收敛性能，以及如何通过方差缩减和分布式设计来提高其收敛速度和通信效率。

Method: 采用理论分析方法，对标准Lion优化器、方差缩减版本、分布式版本以及通信效率变体进行收敛率分析，得出不同算法的理论收敛率上界。

Result: 标准Lion收敛率为O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})，方差缩减版本提升到O(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})。分布式版本在n个节点下分别达到O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})和O(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})。通信效率变体获得O(max{d^{1/4}/T^{1/4}, d^{1/10}/(n^{1/5}T^{1/5})})和O(d^{1/4}/T^{1/4})的收敛率。

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析证明了Lion优化器的收敛性，并提出了多种改进版本来提高收敛速度和通信效率，为大规模优化问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence properties of the Lion optimizer.
First, we establish that the Lion optimizer attains a convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/4})$ under standard assumptions, where $d$ denotes
the problem dimension and $T$ is the iteration number. To further improve this
rate, we introduce the Lion optimizer with variance reduction, resulting in an
enhanced convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}T^{-1/3})$. We then analyze in
distributed settings, where the standard and variance reduced version of the
distributed Lion can obtain the convergence rates of
$\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/2}(nT)^{-1/3})$, with
$n$ denoting the number of nodes. Furthermore, we investigate a
communication-efficient variant of the distributed Lion that ensures sign
compression in both communication directions. By employing the unbiased sign
operations, the proposed Lion variant and its variance reduction counterpart,
achieve convergence rates of $\mathcal{O}\left( \max
\left\{\frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}}, \frac{d^{1/10}}{n^{1/5}T^{1/5}} \right\}
\right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{d^{1/4}}{T^{1/4}} \right)$, respectively.

TL;DR: 通过Funnel Schedule和Adaptive Temperature策略解决模式搜索中的探索-利用困境，在不增加计算成本的情况下显著提升模型生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将推理时缩放技术从语言模型扩展到模式模型，解决早期样本评估困难和后期样本不可逆的基本困境

Method: 提出Funnel Schedule逐渐减少维护粒子数量，和Adaptive Temperature下调早期奖励影响的简单有效策略

Result: 在多个标准测试集和最新文本生成图像模型上表现超过之前的基准方法

Conclusion: 通过针对模式模型生成动力学和相变行为的简单策略，成功解决了模式模型中的探索-利用困境，为推理时缩放技术提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has achieved remarkable success in language models,
yet its adaptation to diffusion models remains underexplored. We observe that
the efficacy of recent Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based methods largely stems
from globally fitting the The reward-tilted distribution, which inherently
preserves diversity during multi-modal search. However, current applications of
SMC to diffusion models face a fundamental dilemma: early-stage noise samples
offer high potential for improvement but are difficult to evaluate accurately,
whereas late-stage samples can be reliably assessed but are largely
irreversible. To address this exploration-exploitation trade-off, we approach
the problem from the perspective of the search algorithm and propose two
strategies: Funnel Schedule and Adaptive Temperature. These simple yet
effective methods are tailored to the unique generation dynamics and
phase-transition behavior of diffusion models. By progressively reducing the
number of maintained particles and down-weighting the influence of early-stage
rewards, our methods significantly enhance sample quality without increasing
the total number of Noise Function Evaluations. Experimental results on
multiple benchmarks and state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models
demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT)模型，通过同时关注临床变量和时间轴来处理电子健康记录数据，在脓毒症预测和死亡率分类任务上达到先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)数据日益复杂，传统Transformer在处理EHR分类时受限于数据表示方式，无法有效处理数据稀疏性和信息缺失问题。

Method: 开发了双向轴Transformer(BAT)模型，同时关注临床变量轴和时间点轴，学习更丰富的数据关系，处理数据稀疏性困难。

Result: BAT在脓毒症预测上达到最先进性能，在死亡率分类上与顶级方法竞争，相比其他Transformer对数据缺失更具鲁棒性，并能学习可迁移的传感器嵌入。

Conclusion: BAT模型有效解决了EHR数据处理的挑战，提供了更好的数据表示和缺失数据处理能力，为EHR分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's
medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical
research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends
indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations.
Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in
natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these
challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process
data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited
by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture
informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer
(BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR
data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data
sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is
competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other
transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and
learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning.
Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or
utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made
available for reproduction and future benchmarking.

Conclusion: 该端到端CAD到成本流水线缩短了报价周期，为成本敏感设计提供可操作见解，构建了可部署的实时ERP集成决策支持途径。

Abstract: We present an integrated machine learning framework that transforms how
manufacturing cost is estimated from 2D engineering drawings. Unlike
traditional quotation workflows that require labor-intensive process planning,
our approach about 200 geometric and statistical descriptors directly from
13,684 DWG drawings of automotive suspension and steering parts spanning 24
product groups. Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost,
LightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage
error across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific
heuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP,
the framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension
maxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for
cost-aware design. This end-to-end CAD-to-cost pipeline shortens quotation lead
times, ensures consistent and transparent cost assessments across part families
and provides a deployable pathway toward real-time, ERP-integrated decision
support in Industry 4.0 manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应均值漂移算法，通过局部距离分布估计聚类基数，动态调整带宽和核半径阈值，在变尺度数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KDE方法只能提供聚类局部区域信息，无法处理具有变化局部尺度和聚类基数的数据集，需要开发能够自适应调整参数的方法

Method: 利用点到所有其他点的局部距离分布，通过识别距离分布密度中的局部最小值来估计局部聚类基数，基于基数估计计算局部聚类参数，在均值漂移执行过程中自适应调整带宽和核半径阈值

Result: 在原始数据集上优于最近提出的自适应均值漂移方法，在更广泛的聚类基准测试中表现出竞争力

Conclusion: 该方法通过局部聚类基数估计实现了有效的参数自适应调整，为变尺度数据集的聚类问题提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets
with varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions,
from a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local
cluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance
distribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters
are then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods,
which provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the
mean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively
adjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm
outperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original
dataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering
benchmark.

### [341] [Cold-RL: Learning Cache Eviction with Offline Reinforcement Learning for NGINX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12485)
*Aayush Gupta,Arpit Bhayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cold-RL是一个基于强化学习的NGINX缓存淘汰策略，使用Dueling DQN在500微秒超时预算内选择淘汰对象，相比传统LRU在25MB缓存下命中率提升146%，在100MB缓存下提升15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LRU缓存淘汰策略对对象大小不敏感，在周期性突发流量和混合对象大小场景下容易产生抖动问题，需要更智能的淘汰机制。

Method: 使用Dueling Deep Q-Network作为ONNX sidecar，在每次淘汰时从K个最近最少使用对象中提取6个轻量级特征（年龄、大小、命中次数、到达间隔时间、剩余TTL、最后源站RTT），通过强化学习训练策略，500微秒超时后回退到原生LRU。

Result: 在25MB缓存下，命中率从0.1436提升到0.3538（146%提升）；在100MB缓存下，从0.7530提升到0.8675（15%提升）；在400MB缓存下与传统方法相当（约0.918）。推理增加不到2%的CPU开销，95%分位淘汰延迟保持在预算内。

Conclusion: Cold-RL是首个集成到NGINX中且满足严格SLO的强化学习淘汰策略，在中小缓存规模下显著优于传统方法，推理开销低且延迟可控。

Abstract: Web proxies such as NGINX commonly rely on least-recently-used (LRU)
eviction, which is size agnostic and can thrash under periodic bursts and mixed
object sizes. We introduce Cold-RL, a learned eviction policy for NGINX that
replaces LRU's forced-expire path with a dueling Deep Q-Network served by an
ONNX sidecar within a strict microsecond budget. On each eviction, Cold-RL
samples the K least-recently-used objects, extracts six lightweight features
(age, size, hit count, inter-arrival time, remaining TTL, and last origin RTT),
and requests a bitmask of victims; a hard timeout of 500 microseconds triggers
immediate fallback to native LRU. Policies are trained offline by replaying
NGINX access logs through a cache simulator with a simple reward: a retained
object earns one point if it is hit again before TTL expiry. We compare against
LRU, LFU, size-based, adaptive LRU, and a hybrid baseline on two adversarial
workloads. With a 25 MB cache, Cold-RL raises hit ratio from 0.1436 to 0.3538,
a 146 percent improvement over the best classical baseline; at 100 MB, from
0.7530 to 0.8675, a 15 percent gain; and at 400 MB it matches classical methods
(about 0.918). Inference adds less than 2 percent CPU overhead and keeps 95th
percentile eviction latency within budget. To our knowledge, this is the first
reinforcement learning eviction policy integrated into NGINX with strict SLOs.

TL;DR: CSCR是一个轻量级框架，通过将提示和模型映射到共享嵌入空间，实现快速、成本敏感的LLM路由选择，在多个基准测试中比基线方法提升25%的准确率-成本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在忽略提示特定上下文、依赖昂贵的模型分析、假设固定专家集合或使用低效试错策略等问题，需要一种更高效的LLM路由方案。

Method: 使用紧凑快速计算的对数足迹处理开源模型，困惑度指纹处理黑盒API，通过对比编码器训练在自适应成本带内选择最便宜准确的专家，推理时通过FAISS索引进行单次k-NN查找。

Result: 在多个基准测试中持续优于基线方法，准确率-成本权衡提升高达25%，对未见过的LLM和分布外提示具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: CSCR提供了一种高效、轻量级的LLM路由解决方案，能够在微秒级延迟下实现成本敏感的选择，且专家池变化时无需重新训练。

Abstract: We study cost-aware routing for large language models across diverse and
dynamic pools of models. Existing approaches often overlook prompt-specific
context, rely on expensive model profiling, assume a fixed set of experts, or
use inefficient trial-and-error strategies. We introduce Cost-Spectrum
Contrastive Routing (CSCR), a lightweight framework that maps both prompts and
models into a shared embedding space to enable fast, cost-sensitive selection.
CSCR uses compact, fast-to-compute logit footprints for open-source models and
perplexity fingerprints for black-box APIs. A contrastive encoder is trained to
favor the cheapest accurate expert within adaptive cost bands. At inference
time, routing reduces to a single k-NN lookup via a FAISS index, requiring no
retraining when the expert pool changes and enabling microsecond latency.
Across multiple benchmarks, CSCR consistently outperforms baselines, improving
the accuracy-cost tradeoff by up to 25%, while generalizing robustly to unseen
LLMs and out-of-distribution prompts.

Motivation: 传统方法在目标测度与先验测度差异较大时优化困难，需要一种系统性的逐步逼近方法

Method: 采用迭代求解带信任区域的约束问题，实现从先验测度到目标测度的几何退火，信任区域提供了退火路径中时间步长的原则性选择

Result: 在多个最优控制应用中显著提升性能，包括基于扩散的采样、过渡路径采样和扩散模型微调任务

Conclusion: 基于信任区域的几何退火方法为解决随机最优控制问题提供了一种有效且原则性的途径

Abstract: Solving stochastic optimal control problems with quadratic control costs can
be viewed as approximating a target path space measure, e.g. via gradient-based
optimization. In practice, however, this optimization is challenging in
particular if the target measure differs substantially from the prior. In this
work, we therefore approach the problem by iteratively solving constrained
problems incorporating trust regions that aim for approaching the target
measure gradually in a systematic way. It turns out that this trust region
based strategy can be understood as a geometric annealing from the prior to the
target measure, where, however, the incorporated trust regions lead to a
principled and educated way of choosing the time steps in the annealing path.
We demonstrate in multiple optimal control applications that our novel method
can improve performance significantly, including tasks in diffusion-based
sampling, transition path sampling, and fine-tuning of diffusion models.

Motivation: VAE模型存在后验冲突问题，导致生成样本多样性不足。现有方法需要网络结构限制，交易效果不理惵

Result: 在MNIST、fashionMNIST、Omniglot、CelebA、FFHQ等多个数据集上有效控制后验冲突

Conclusion: 新方法能够无需特定网络结构限制地控制后验冲突，提高生成样本多样性

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs), one of the most widely used generative
models, are known to suffer from posterior collapse, a phenomenon that reduces
the diversity of generated samples. To avoid posterior collapse, many prior
works have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the
trade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For
this reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent
identifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they
require structural constraints on the network architecture. For further
clarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of
individual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.
Then, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by
mathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control
posterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture. We
experimentally evaluate our approach, which controls posterior collapse on
varied datasets such as MNIST, fashionMNIST, Omniglot, CelebA, and FFHQ.

Motivation: 证义传统观念，即细调语言模型必然会损害其安全性，并找到更简单有效的方法来避免这个问题。

Method: 系统性测试不同超参数组合，并提出在参数空间中使用指数移动平均(EMA)动量技术，创建稳定的优化路径。

Result: 在Llama模型家族上验证，将有害响应率从16%显著降至约5%，同时保持了模型的功能性能。

Conclusion: 细调过程中的安全问题主要由优化选择不当导致，通过合理的超参数调整和EMA技术可以有效避免，无需额外安全数据或专门干预。

Abstract: Fine-tuning language models is commonly believed to inevitably harm their
safety, i.e., refusing to respond to harmful user requests, even when using
harmless datasets, thus requiring additional safety measures. We challenge this
belief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,
rather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as
harmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training
hyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we
reduce unsafe model responses from 16\% to approximately 5\%, as measured by
keyword matching, while maintaining utility performance. Based on this
observation, we propose a simple exponential moving average (EMA) momentum
technique in parameter space that preserves safety performance by creating a
stable optimization path and retains the original pre-trained model's safety
properties. Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets
(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can
largely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing
approaches that require additional safety data while offering practical
guidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.

Abstract: The construction of brain graphs from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) data plays a crucial role in enabling graph machine learning for
neuroimaging. However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that
overlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In
this work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and
benchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,
constrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design
space into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and
graph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in
evaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence
downstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal
filtering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,
alternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as
incorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets
show that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve
classification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the
critical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of
systematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based
neuroimaging. Our code is available at

efficiency, scalability, and generalization. This paper introduces OS-R1, an
agentic Linux kernel tuning framework powered by rule-based reinforcement
learning (RL). By abstracting the kernel configuration space as an RL

configuration modification accuracy, and system performance awareness of the
LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase training process that accelerates
convergence and minimizes retraining across diverse tuning scenarios.
Experimental results show that OS-R1 significantly outperforms existing

Abstract: Coding agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have gained traction
for automating code generation through iterative problem-solving with minimal
human involvement. Despite the emergence of various frameworks, e.g.,
LangChain, AutoML, and AIDE, ML scientists still struggle to effectively review

inspecting individual outputs is inefficient, making it difficult to track code
evolution, compare coding iterations, and identify improvement opportunities.
To address this challenge, we introduce a visual analytics system designed to
enhance the examination of coding agent behaviors. Focusing on the AIDE
framework, our system supports comparative analysis across three levels: (1)
Code-Level Analysis, which reveals how the agent debugs and refines its code
over iterations; (2) Process-Level Analysis, which contrasts different
solution-seeking processes explored by the agent; and (3) LLM-Level Analysis,
which highlights variations in coding behavior across different LLMs. By
integrating these perspectives, our system enables ML scientists to gain a
structured understanding of agent behaviors, facilitating more effective
debugging and prompt engineering. Through case studies using coding agents to
tackle popular Kaggle competitions, we demonstrate how our system provides
valuable insights into the iterative coding process.

Abstract: To address the complexity of financial time series, this paper proposes a
forecasting model combining sliding window and variational mode decomposition
(VMD) methods. Historical stock prices and relevant market indicators are used
to construct datasets. VMD decomposes non-stationary financial time series into
smoother subcomponents, improving model adaptability. The decomposed data is
then input into a deep learning model for prediction. The study compares the
forecasting effects of an LSTM model trained on VMD-processed sequences with
those using raw time series, demonstrating better performance and stability.

Abstract: Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are
notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be
appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional
dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic
loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,
history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics
from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework
using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by
construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the
first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a
discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium
statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before
specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable
for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning
strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on
benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)
coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while
preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed
video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local
rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source
implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and
extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.

Abstract: The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal
point of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply
advanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting
amyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and
the individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident

bidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and
protein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold
cross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据非独立同分布的特性给训练全局模型带来挑战，需要研究如何在数据异构情况下保证模型泛化性能。

Method: 理论分析过参数化FedAvg与梯度下降的收敛性，证明网络宽度对数据异构性影响的数学关系，并在无限宽度下建立线性模型等价性。

Result: 理论证明数据异构性影响随网络宽度增加而减弱，无限宽度时完全消失；FedAvg在无限宽度下能达到与集中式学习相同的泛化性能。实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 通过增加神经网络宽度可以有效缓解联邦学习中的数据异构问题，在过参数化条件下FedAvg能够达到理想的收敛和泛化性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to train a model
collaboratively without sharing local data. A key distinction between FL and
centralized learning is that clients' data are non-independent and identically
distributed, which poses significant challenges in training a global model that
generalizes well across heterogeneous local data distributions. In this paper,
we analyze the convergence of overparameterized FedAvg with gradient descent
(GD). We prove that the impact of data heterogeneity diminishes as the width of
neural networks increases, ultimately vanishing when the width approaches
infinity. In the infinite-width regime, we further prove that both the global
and local models in FedAvg behave as linear models, and that FedAvg achieves
the same generalization performance as centralized learning with the same
number of GD iterations. Extensive experiments validate our theoretical
findings across various network architectures, loss functions, and optimization
methods.

Abstract: To address the growing demand for on-device LLM inference in
resource-constrained environments, hybrid language models (HLM) have emerged,
combining lightweight local models with powerful cloud-based LLMs. Recent
studies on HLM have primarily focused on improving accuracy and latency, while
often overlooking communication and energy efficiency. We propose a token-level
filtering mechanism for an energy-efficient importance- and uncertainty-aware
HLM inference that leverages both epistemic uncertainty and attention-based
importance. Our method opportunistically uploads only informative tokens,
reducing LLM usage and communication costs. Experiments with TinyLlama-1.1B and
LLaMA-2-7B demonstrate that our method achieves up to 87.5% BERT Score and
token throughput of 0.37 tokens/sec while saving the energy consumption by
40.7% compared to standard HLM. Furthermore, compared to our previous U-HLM
baseline, our method improves BERTScore from 85.8% to 87.0%, energy savings
from 31.6% to 43.6%, and throughput from 0.36 to 0.40. This approach enables an

Conclusion: PI-DeepONet框架为交通状态估计提供了一种物理一致且高效的解决方案，通过算子学习方法成功解决了高维时空PDE问题，并展示了输入函数生成策略和分支网络复杂度对性能的影响。

Abstract: Traffic state estimation (TSE) fundamentally involves solving
high-dimensional spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) governing
traffic flow dynamics from limited, noisy measurements. While Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) enforce PDE constraints point-wise, this paper adopts a
physics-informed deep operator network (PI-DeepONet) framework that
reformulates TSE as an operator learning problem. Our approach trains a
parameterized neural operator that maps sparse input data to the full
spatiotemporal traffic state field, governed by the traffic flow conservation
law. Crucially, unlike PINNs that enforce PDE constraints point-wise,
PI-DeepONet integrates traffic flow conservation model and the fundamental
diagram directly into the operator learning process, ensuring physical
consistency while capturing congestion propagation, spatial correlations, and
temporal evolution. Experiments on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate superior
performance over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals insights
into optimal function generation strategies and branch network complexity.
Additionally, the impact of input function generation methods and the number of
functions on model performance is explored, highlighting the robustness and
efficacy of proposed framework.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of self-attention limits its applicability and
scalability on large unstructured meshes. We introduce Fast Low-rank Attention
Routing Engine (FLARE), a linear complexity self-attention mechanism that
routes attention through fixed-length latent sequences. Each attention head
performs global communication among $N$ tokens by projecting the input sequence
onto a fixed length latent sequence of $M \ll N$ tokens using learnable query
tokens. By routing attention through a bottleneck sequence, FLARE learns a
low-rank form of attention that can be applied at $O(NM)$ cost. FLARE not only
scales to unprecedented problem sizes, but also delivers superior accuracy
compared to state-of-the-art neural PDE surrogates across diverse benchmarks.
We also release a new additive manufacturing dataset to spur further research.

Abstract: We present a hybrid surrogate model for electric vehicle parameter estimation
and power consumption. We combine our novel architecture Spectral Parameter
Operator built on a Fourier Neural Operator backbone for global context and a
differentiable physics module in the forward pass. From speed and acceleration
alone, it outputs time-varying motor and regenerative braking efficiencies, as
well as aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, effective mass, and auxiliary
power. These parameters drive a physics-embedded estimate of battery power,
eliminating any separate physics-residual loss. The modular design lets
representations converge to physically meaningful parameters that reflect the
current state and condition of the vehicle. We evaluate on real-world logs from
a Tesla Model 3, Tesla Model S, and the Kia EV9. The surrogate achieves a mean
absolute error of 0.2kW (about 1% of average traction power at highway speeds)
for Tesla vehicles and about 0.8kW on the Kia EV9. The framework is
interpretable, and it generalizes well to unseen conditions, and sampling

Conclusion: SSPO提供了一种高效的可插拔RL过程监督框架，无需额外资源即可优化LLM的推理过程。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has proven effective in further enhancing the performance
of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). However, mainstream post-training
methods (i.e., reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning) often incur substantial computational overhead due to auxiliary
models and overthinking. In this paper, we empirically reveal that the
incorrect answers partially stem from verbose reasoning processes lacking
correct self-fix, where errors accumulate across multiple reasoning steps. To
this end, we propose Self-traced Step-wise Preference Optimization (SSPO), a
pluggable RL process supervision framework that enables fine-grained
optimization of each reasoning step. Specifically, SSPO requires neither
auxiliary models nor stepwise manual annotations. Instead, it leverages
step-wise preference signals generated by the model itself to guide the
optimization process for reasoning compression. Experiments demonstrate that
the generated reasoning sequences from SSPO are both accurate and succinct,
effectively mitigating overthinking behaviors without compromising model
performance across diverse domains and languages.

*Florian J. Boge,Annika Schuster*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文探讨了可解释人工智能(XAI)方法的可信质性问题，提出了解释稳健性(ER)和解释方法稳健性(EMR)两个重要标准，并为深度学习算法的可信解释提供了框架性指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习算法在预测准确性方面表现出艰，但其内部工作机制极其不透明，导致了可信质性挑战。虽然XAI方法提供了解释能力，但最近的评估结果显示这些方法的表现存在问题，需要更严格的可信质标准。

Method: 论文提出了两个核心概念：解释稳健性(ER)和解释方法稳健性(EMR)。ER要求在相似情境下不同XAI方法产生相同的解释；EMR则要求每个XAI方法在不同情境下产生一致的解释。论文进一步形式化了这些标准，构建了一个完整的可信解释框架。

Result: 论文为评估XAI方法的可信质性提供了严格的理论基础和实践指南。通过形式化ER和EMR标准，研究人员能够更有效地验证各种解释方法的可靠性。这个框架也为建立对深度学习算法的信任提供了重要支撑。

Conclusion: 仅仅依靠单一XAI方法的稳健性不足以确保解释的可信质。必须同时满足解释稳健性(ER)和解释方法稳健性(EMR)两个标准才能实现真正可靠的解释。论文提供的框架不仅有助于理论研究，还为实际应用提供了具体的指导，并指明了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) algorithms are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life and in
scientific research. However, the price we pay for their impressively accurate
predictions is significant: their inner workings are notoriously opaque - it is
unknown to laypeople and researchers alike what features of the data a DL
system focuses on and how it ultimately succeeds in predicting correct outputs.
A necessary criterion for trustworthy explanations is that they should reflect
the relevant processes the algorithms' predictions are based on. The field of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) presents promising methods to create
such explanations. But recent reviews about their performance offer reasons for
skepticism. As we will argue, a good criterion for trustworthiness is
explanatory robustness: different XAI methods produce the same explanations in
comparable contexts. However, in some instances, all methods may give the same,
but still wrong, explanation. We therefore argue that in addition to
explanatory robustness (ER), a prior requirement of explanation method
robustness (EMR) has to be fulfilled by every XAI method. Conversely, the
robustness of an individual method is in itself insufficient for
trustworthiness. In what follows, we develop and formalize criteria for ER as
well as EMR, providing a framework for explaining and establishing trust in DL
algorithms. We also highlight interesting application cases and outline
directions for future work.

Abstract: A generative model capable of sampling realistic molecules with desired
properties could accelerate chemical discovery across a wide range of
applications. Toward this goal, significant effort has focused on developing
models that jointly sample molecular topology and 3D structure. We present
FlowMol3, an open-source, multi-modal flow matching model that advances the
state of the art for all-atom, small-molecule generation. Its substantial
performance gains over previous FlowMol versions are achieved without changes
to the graph neural network architecture or the underlying flow matching
formulation. Instead, FlowMol3's improvements arise from three
architecture-agnostic techniques that incur negligible computational cost:
self-conditioning, fake atoms, and train-time geometry distortion. FlowMol3
achieves nearly 100% molecular validity for drug-like molecules with explicit
hydrogens, more accurately reproduces the functional group composition and
geometry of its training data, and does so with an order of magnitude fewer
learnable parameters than comparable methods. We hypothesize that these
techniques mitigate a general pathology affecting transport-based generative
models, enabling detection and correction of distribution drift during
inference. Our results highlight simple, transferable strategies for improving
the stability and quality of diffusion- and flow-based molecular generative
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于加性噪声模型的因果排序方法需要准确估计对数密度的Hessian对角线，但之前的Stein梯度估计器计算成本高且内存密集，而DiffAN方法虽然解决了这些问题，但由于score模型的二阶导数导致数值不稳定。

Method: 提出Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO)，这是一种在平滑函数空间中的概率生成模型，旨在稳定近似Hessian对角线并在score建模过程中保持结构信息。还提出了概率控制算法，将SciNO的概率估计与自回归模型先验结合。

Result: 实验结果显示，SciNO相比DiffAN在合成图上平均减少42.7%的排序差异，在真实数据集上减少31.5%的排序差异，同时保持内存效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不进行额外微调或提示工程的情况下增强大型语言模型的因果推理能力，为数据驱动的因果排序提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Ordering-based approaches to causal discovery identify topological orders of
causal graphs, providing scalable alternatives to combinatorial search methods.
Under the Additive Noise Model (ANM) assumption, recent causal ordering methods
based on score matching require an accurate estimation of the Hessian diagonal
of the log-densities. However, previous approaches mainly use Stein gradient
estimators, which are computationally expensive and memory-intensive. Although
DiffAN addresses these limitations by substituting kernel-based estimates with
diffusion models, it remains numerically unstable due to the second-order
derivatives of score models. To alleviate these problems, we propose
Score-informed Neural Operator (SciNO), a probabilistic generative model in
smooth function spaces designed to stably approximate the Hessian diagonal and
to preserve structural information during the score modeling. Empirical results
show that SciNO reduces order divergence by 42.7% on synthetic graphs and by
31.5% on real-world datasets on average compared to DiffAN, while maintaining
memory efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic
control algorithm for causal reasoning with autoregressive models that
integrates SciNO's probability estimates with autoregressive model priors,
enabling reliable data-driven causal ordering informed by semantic information.
Consequently, the proposed method enhances causal reasoning abilities of LLMs
without additional fine-tuning or prompt engineering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端可能遭受拜占庭攻击，而服务器通常是可信的并拥有可信侧数据集。现有方法需要知道恶意客户端数量或假设更多诚实参与者，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用可信服务器和至少一个诚实客户端，通过理论分析和算法设计，在不知道恶意客户端数量的情况下实现有效的拜占庭鲁棒性。使用可信侧数据集来验证和校正模型更新。

Result: 理论分析显示即使在强拜占庭攻击下也能保持有界的最优性差距。在MNIST、FMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上的实验表明，该方法在标签翻转、符号翻转和高斯噪声等多种攻击策略下显著优于Mean、Trimmed Mean、Median、Krum和Multi-Krum等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为联邦学习提供了强大的拜占庭鲁棒性，只需要最少的安全假设（服务器和一个诚实客户端），无需预先知道恶意客户端数量，在实际部署中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple
clients without sharing private data. We consider FL scenarios wherein FL
clients are subject to adversarial (Byzantine) attacks, while the FL server is
trusted (honest) and has a trustworthy side dataset. This may correspond to,
e.g., cases where the server possesses trusted data prior to federation, or to
the presence of a trusted client that temporarily assumes the server role. Our
approach requires only two honest participants, i.e., the server and one
client, to function effectively, without prior knowledge of the number of
malicious clients. Theoretical analysis demonstrates bounded optimality gaps
even under strong Byzantine attacks. Experimental results show that our
algorithm significantly outperforms standard and robust FL baselines such as
Mean, Trimmed Mean, Median, Krum, and Multi-Krum under various attack
strategies including label flipping, sign flipping, and Gaussian noise addition
across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 benchmarks using the Flower framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在解决数据异构性方面取得进展，但无法泛化到具有域内分布偏移和资源约束的非参与客户端，需要一种能够适应这些客户端独特数据分布的方法。

Method: 使用超网络根据分布感知嵌入动态生成专用模型，通过NoisyEmbed增强的提取器和平衡惩罚提取鲁棒的分布嵌入，防止特征崩溃，然后逐块生成针对非参与客户端的专用模型。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上的广泛实验表明，HyperFedZero性能显著优于竞争方法，计算、存储和通信开销最小，消融研究和可视化验证了各组件的必要性。

Conclusion: HyperFedZero通过分布感知的归纳偏置和动态模型生成，有效解决了联邦学习中非参与客户端的泛化问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
privacy-preserving collaborative learning, yet data heterogeneity remains a
critical challenge. While existing methods achieve progress in addressing data
heterogeneity for participating clients, they fail to generalize to
non-participating clients with in-domain distribution shifts and resource
constraints. To mitigate this issue, we present HyperFedZero, a novel method
that dynamically generates specialized models via a hypernetwork conditioned on
distribution-aware embeddings. Our approach explicitly incorporates
distribution-aware inductive biases into the model's forward pass, extracting
robust distribution embeddings using a NoisyEmbed-enhanced extractor with a
Balancing Penalty, effectively preventing feature collapse. The hypernetwork
then leverages these embeddings to generate specialized models chunk-by-chunk
for non-participating clients, ensuring adaptability to their unique data
distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models
demonstrate HyperFedZero's remarkable performance, surpassing competing methods
consistently with minimal computational, storage, and communication overhead.
Moreover, ablation studies and visualizations further validate the necessity of
each component, confirming meaningful adaptations and validating the
effectiveness of HyperFedZero.

Motivation: 当前缺乏高质量、大规模的建筑物热力学数据来支持迁移学习研究，现有数据生成方法需要专业知识且数据量不足

Method: 使用单区域Modelica模型导出为功能模拟单元(FMU)，在Python中进行模拟来生成合成数据

Result: 成功生成了足够质量和数量的数据，并用于迁移学习模型的预训练和微调

Conclusion: BuilDa框架能够有效解决建筑物热力学数据稀缺问题，为迁移学习研究提供必要的数据支持

Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) can improve data-driven modeling of building thermal
dynamics. Therefore, many new TL research areas emerge in the field, such as
selecting the right source model for TL. However, these research directions
require massive amounts of thermal building data which is lacking presently.
Neither public datasets nor existing data generators meet the needs of TL
research in terms of data quality and quantity. Moreover, existing data
generation approaches typically require expert knowledge in building
simulation. We present BuilDa, a thermal building data generation framework for
producing synthetic data of adequate quality and quantity for TL research. The
framework does not require profound building simulation knowledge to generate
large volumes of data. BuilDa uses a single-zone Modelica model that is
exported as a Functional Mock-up Unit (FMU) and simulated in Python. We
demonstrate BuilDa by generating data and utilizing it for pretraining and
fine-tuning TL models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种专门用于汽车网络中交通标志检测的联邦学习框架，通过分布式模型训练解决数据隐私和通信挟失问题，实验结果显示该方法能够在保护数据隐私的同时达到高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶汽车产生的大量传感器数据带来了严重的隐私和通信挟失挑战，传统的中心化机器学习方法在感知任务中存在显著缺陷，需要开发能够在不共享原始数据的情况下进行协作模型训练的解决方案。

Method: 研究设计了一种分布式联邦学习框架：将交通标志类别在不同汽车之间进行分配以进行专门化本地训练，使用轻量级对象检测器，通过Flower框架在模拟环境中采用FedProx、FedAdam和FedAVG等算法联合模型参数，并评估多种配置参数包括服务器迭代轮数、本地训练轮数、客户端参与比例和数据分布。

Result: 实验结果显示：将服务器轮数从2增加到20轮时，准确率从0.1以下提升到0.8以上；适中的本地训练轮数（8-10轮）能够在准确率约0.67的情况下实现最优效率；更高的客户端参与比例能够将模型通用性提升到0.83；FedProx在处理异质性数据时表现超过其他联合算法；非IID数据分布会降低性能；训练时长主要受轮数数量影响而非联合策略。

Conclusion: 这种联邦学习方法为真实世界汽车部署提供了一种可扩展、保护隐私的解决方案，为未来智能交通系统的集成提供了指导。该方法有望通过集成更稳健的联合算法和通信优化技术来推动智能交通系统的发展。

Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily,
raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized
machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a
decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection
in vehicular networks to enable collaborative model training without sharing
raw data. The framework partitioned traffic sign classes across vehicles for
specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model
parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated
environment with the Flower framework, and evaluated multiple configurations
including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions,
and data distributions. Experiments demonstrated that increasing server rounds
from 2 to 20 boosted accuracy from below 0.1 to over 0.8, moderate local epochs
(8-10) provided optimal efficiency with accuracies around 0.67, higher client
participation fractions enhanced generalization up to 0.83, FedProx
outperformed other aggregators in handling heterogeneity, non-IID data
distributions reduced performance compared to IID, and training duration
primarily scaled with the number of rounds rather than aggregation strategy. We
conclude that this federated approach may offer a scalable, privacy-preserving
solution for real-world vehicular deployments, potentially guiding future
integrations of robust aggregation and communication optimizations to advance
intelligent transportation systems.

TL;DR: FedSODA是一个资源高效的联邦微调框架，通过层剪枝和蒸馏对齐技术，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低通信、存储和计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦微调在资源受限客户端上存在计算和内存需求高的问题，限制了其发展潜力，需要一种不需要访问或存储完整模型的解决方案。

Method: 提出相似性组剪枝(SGP)模块剪枝冗余层，引入协调蒸馏对齐(ODA)模块减少梯度分歧，结合QLoRA技术仅微调轻量级适配器。

Result: 实验表明FedSODA平均减少70.6%通信开销、降低75.6%存储使用，并提高3.1%任务准确率。

Conclusion: FedSODA非常适合资源受限环境下的实际联邦微调应用，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) of large language models (LLMs) has recently
emerged as a promising solution to enable domain-specific adaptation while
preserving data privacy. Despite its benefits, FFT on resource-constrained
clients relies on the high computational and memory demands of full-model
fine-tuning, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents
FedSODA, a resource-efficient FFT framework that enables clients to adapt LLMs
without accessing or storing the full model. Specifically, we first propose a
similarity group pruning (SGP) module, which prunes redundant layers from the
full LLM while retaining the most critical layers to preserve the model
performance. Moreover, we introduce an orchestrated distillation alignment
(ODA) module to reduce gradient divergence between the sub-LLM and the full LLM
during FFT. Through the use of the QLoRA, clients only need to deploy quantized
sub-LLMs and fine-tune lightweight adapters, significantly reducing local
resource requirements. We conduct extensive experiments on three open-source
LLMs across a variety of downstream tasks. The experimental results demonstrate
that FedSODA reduces communication overhead by an average of 70.6%, decreases
storage usage by 75.6%, and improves task accuracy by 3.1%, making it highly
suitable for practical FFT applications under resource constraints.

Conclusion: FedUNet能够实现高效的异构联邦学习，在保持高性能的同时显著降低通信成本。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
local data. However, most existing methods assume identical model architectures
across clients, limiting their applicability in heterogeneous real-world
environments. To address this, we propose FedUNet, a lightweight and
architecture-agnostic FL framework that attaches a U-Net-inspired additive
module to each client's backbone. By sharing only the compact bottleneck of the
U-Net, FedUNet enables efficient knowledge transfer without structural
alignment. The encoder-decoder design and skip connections in the U-Net help
capture both low-level and high-level features, facilitating the extraction of
clientinvariant representations. This enables cooperative learning between the
backbone and the additive module with minimal communication cost. Experiment
with VGG variants shows that FedUNet achieves 93.11% accuracy and 92.68% in
compact form (i.e., a lightweight version of FedUNet) with only 0.89 MB low
communication overhead.

Abstract: This paper presents preliminary results in the definition of a comprehensive
benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate spatial reasoning
capabilities in neural networks, with a particular focus on morphological
properties such as connectivity and distance relationships. The framework is
currently being used to study the capabilities of nnU-Net, exploiting the
spatial model checker VoxLogicA to generate two distinct categories of
synthetic datasets: maze connectivity problems for topological analysis and
spatial distance computation tasks for geometric understanding. Each category
is evaluated across multiple resolutions to assess scalability and
generalization properties. The automated pipeline encompasses a complete
machine learning workflow including: synthetic dataset generation, standardized
training with cross-validation, inference execution, and comprehensive
evaluation using Dice coefficient and IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.
Preliminary experimental results demonstrate significant challenges in neural
network spatial reasoning capabilities, revealing systematic failures in basic
geometric and topological understanding tasks. The framework provides a
reproducible experimental protocol, enabling researchers to identify specific
limitations. Such limitations could be addressed through hybrid approaches
combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning methods for improved spatial

Motivation: 传统质心聚类方法缺乏对簇扩散程度的控制，需要一种能够在保持可解释性的同时约束簇大小的聚类方法，适用于传感器网络、协作机器人等需要结构化聚类的应用场景。

Method: 采用拉格朗日公式推导出闭式解，在聚类过程中强制约束簇中心到最远点的最大距离，从而控制簇的径向扩散同时保持角度结构。

Result: 在具有径向对称性和均匀角度分布的合成圆形数据上实验表明，CCC在环向熵、扇区熵和联合熵等评估指标上优于K-means和GMM，能够产生更紧凑的簇。

Conclusion: CCC方法通过约束最大距离实现了更紧凑的聚类结果，在保持角度结构的同时有效控制了径向扩散，为需要结构化聚类和扩散控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents Constrained Centroid Clustering (CCC), a method that
extends classical centroid-based clustering by enforcing a constraint on the
maximum distance between the cluster center and the farthest point in the
cluster. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we derive a closed-form solution that
maintains interpretability while controlling cluster spread. To evaluate CCC,
we conduct experiments on synthetic circular data with radial symmetry and
uniform angular distribution. Using ring-wise, sector-wise, and joint entropy
as evaluation metrics, we show that CCC achieves more compact clusters by
reducing radial spread while preserving angular structure, outperforming
standard methods such as K-means and GMM. The proposed approach is suitable for
applications requiring structured clustering with spread control, including
sensor networks, collaborative robotics, and interpretable pattern analysis.

Conclusion: 该ELM基于MIMO的方法为短期能源预测提供了一种高效、低计算复杂度的解决方案，具有良好的适应性和实时性能，适用于各种地区和能源系统。

Abstract: A novel methodology for short-term energy forecasting using an Extreme
Learning Machine ($\mathtt{ELM}$) is proposed. Using six years of hourly data
collected in Corsica (France) from multiple energy sources (solar, wind, hydro,
thermal, bioenergy, and imported electricity), our approach predicts both
individual energy outputs and total production (\cyr{including imports, which
closely follow energy demand, modulo losses)} through a Multi-Input
Multi-Output ($\mathtt{MIMO}$) architecture. To address non-stationarity and
seasonal variability, sliding window techniques and cyclic time encoding are
incorporated, enabling dynamic adaptation to fluctuations. The $\mathtt{ELM}$
model significantly outperforms persistence-based forecasting, particularly for
solar and thermal energy, achieving an $\mathtt{nRMSE}$ of $17.9\%$ and
$5.1\%$, respectively, with $\mathtt{R^2} > 0.98$ (1-hour horizon). The model
maintains high accuracy up to five hours ahead, beyond which renewable energy
sources become increasingly volatile. While $\mathtt{MIMO}$ provides marginal
gains over Single-Input Single-Output ($\mathtt{SISO}$) architectures and
offers key advantages over deep learning methods such as $\mathtt{LSTM}$, it
provides a closed-form solution with lower computational demands, making it
well-suited for real-time applications, including online learning. Beyond
predictive accuracy, the proposed methodology is adaptable to various contexts
and datasets, as it can be tuned to local constraints such as resource
availability, grid characteristics, and market structures.

Conclusion: E3Former模型有效解决了服务器less系统中工作负载预测的挑战，实现了高精度预测和显著资源节省，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: In the swiftly evolving domain of cloud computing, the advent of serverless
systems underscores the crucial need for predictive auto-scaling systems. This
necessity arises to ensure optimal resource allocation and maintain operational
efficiency in inherently volatile environments. At the core of a predictive
auto-scaling system is the workload forecasting model. Existing forecasting
models struggle to quickly adapt to the dynamics in online workload streams and
have difficulty capturing the complex periodicity brought by fine-grained,
high-frequency forecasting tasks. Addressing this, we propose a novel online
ensemble model, E3Former, for online workload forecasting in large-scale
predictive auto-scaling. Our model synergizes the predictive capabilities of
multiple subnetworks to surmount the limitations of single-model approaches,
thus ensuring superior accuracy and robustness. Remarkably, it accomplishes
this with a minimal increase in computational overhead, adhering to the lean
operational ethos of serverless systems. Through extensive experimentation on
real-world workload datasets, we establish the efficacy of our ensemble model.
In online forecasting tasks, the proposed method reduces forecast error by an
average of 10%, and its effectiveness is further demonstrated through a
predictive auto-scaling test in the real-life online system. Currently, our
method has been deployed within ByteDance's Intelligent Horizontal Pod
Auto-scaling (IHPA) platform, which supports the stable operation of over 30
applications, such as Douyin E-Comerce, TouTiao, and Volcano Engine. The
predictive auto-scaling capacity reaching over 600,000 CPU cores. On the basis
of essentially ensuring service quality, the predictive auto-scaling system can
reduce resource utilization by over 40%.

Conclusion: 从物理动力学视角理解transformer的过平滑问题，提出的Wavy Transformer架构有效缓解该问题，为transformer设计提供了新的物理启发性思路

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, deep transformer models
often suffer from an over-smoothing issue, in which token representations
converge to similar values as they pass through successive transformer blocks.
In this paper, we establish an equivalence between the hidden-state dynamics
induced by stacked attention layers and graph neural diffusion on a complete
graph. From this perspective, over-smoothing can be interpreted as a
consequence of the dissipative nature of the underlying diffusion dynamics.
Motivated by this physical interpretation, we propose Wavy Transformer, which
consists of a novel attention layer based on second-order wavy dynamics. We
also introduce a feed-forward network and a normalization layer designed to
preserve the physical state-velocity relationship under the chain rule, thereby
extending the transformer architecture. We further validate our proposed
techniques on various transformer models for NLP and CV tasks. The results
consistently demonstrate that Wavy Transformer improves performance with
minimal additional parameters and no extra hyperparameter tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评判者时其评估结果与人类判断存在系统性偏差，需要建立统计框架来弥合这种差距并改进LLM评分。

Method: 提出Bridge框架，假设每个提示-响应对存在潜在的人类偏好分数，将LLM偏差建模为协变量的线性变换，并提供高效的拟合算法和统计推断保证。

Result: 在6个LLM评判者和2个基准测试(BigGen Bench和Chatbot Arena)上，Bridge实现了与人类评分更高的一致性(准确率、校准和KL散度)，并揭示了系统性的人-LLM差距。

Conclusion: Bridge提供了一个简单而有原则的框架来改进LLM评分并量化人类与LLM评估之间的系统性差异。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used as judges (LLM-as-a-judge) to
evaluate model outputs at scale, but their assessments often diverge
systematically from human judgments. We present Bridge, a unified statistical
framework that explicitly bridges human and LLM evaluations under both absolute
scoring and pairwise comparison paradigms. Bridge posits a latent human
preference score for each prompt-response pair and models LLM deviations as
linear transformations of covariates that capture sources of discrepancies.
This offers a simple and principled framework for refining LLM ratings and
characterizing systematic discrepancies between humans and LLMs. We provide an
efficient fitting algorithm with asymptotic guarantees for statistical
inference. Using six LLM judges and two benchmarks (BigGen Bench and Chatbot
Arena), Bridge achieves higher agreement with human ratings (accuracy,
calibration, and KL divergence) and exposes systematic human-LLM gaps.

Motivation: 传统MoE网络存在专家容量约束导致token丢弃和硬件效率低下，而去除约束又会破坏负载平衡和计算效率，需要新的路由范式来解决这些根本问题

Method: 将路由建模为最小成本最大流问题，集成SoftTopk算子，避免了迭代重路由和最优传输公式的局限性

Result: 在相同FLOPs下相比有约束和无约束基线实现了更低的训练损失和更高的评估分数

Conclusion: MaxScore解决了MoE路由中的根本限制，提供了更好的性能和效率平衡

Abstract: Routing networks in sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) dynamically
allocate input tokens to top-k experts through differentiable sparse
transformations, enabling scalable model capacity while preserving
computational efficiency. Traditional MoE networks impose an expert capacity
constraint to ensure GPU-friendly computation. However, this leads to token
dropping when capacity is saturated and results in low hardware efficiency due
to padding in underutilized experts. Removing the capacity constraint, in turn,
compromises load balancing and computational efficiency. To address these
issues, we propose Maximum Score Routing ($\mathbf{MaxScore}$), a novel MoE
routing paradigm that models routing as a minimum-cost maximum-flow problem and
integrates a SoftTopk operator. MaxScore resolves the fundamental limitations
of iterative rerouting and optimal transport formulations, achieving lower
training losses and higher evaluation scores at equivalent FLOPs compared to
both constrained and unconstrained baselines. Implementation details and
experimental configurations can be obtained from

Result: L2S方法在减少幻觉和增强安全性方面优于其他静态基线方法

Conclusion: 输入特定的细粒度转向方法能够更有效地引导多模态大语言模型，提升模型的安全性和可靠性

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a practical approach to enable post-hoc guidance of
LLMs towards enforcing a specific behavior. However, it remains largely
underexplored for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs); furthermore, existing steering
techniques, such as mean steering, rely on a single steering vector, applied
independently of the input query. This paradigm faces limitations when the
desired behavior is dependent on the example at hand. For example, a safe
answer may consist in abstaining from answering when asked for an illegal
activity, or may point to external resources or consultation with an expert
when asked about medical advice. In this paper, we investigate a fine-grained
steering that uses an input-specific linear shift. This shift is computed using
contrastive input-specific prompting. However, the input-specific prompts
required for this approach are not known at test time. Therefore, we propose to
train a small auxiliary module to predict the input-specific steering vector.
Our approach, dubbed as L2S (Learn-to-Steer), demonstrates that it reduces
hallucinations and enforces safety in MLLMs, outperforming other static
baselines.

Method: 通过实证研究分析数据压缩的权衡关系，评估了简单的均匀数据删除或一刀切压缩策略的效果

Result: 发现不同数据样本对压缩的敏感度存在显著差异，证明了样本级别适应性压缩策略的可行性

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发新一代存储感知学习系统奠定了基础，通过系统化的特征化提供了对存储感知学习领域的深入见解

Abstract: On-device machine learning is often constrained by limited storage,
particularly in continuous data collection scenarios. This paper presents an
empirical study on storage-aware learning, focusing on the trade-off between
data quantity and quality via compression. We demonstrate that naive
strategies, such as uniform data dropping or one-size-fits-all compression, are
suboptimal. Our findings further reveal that data samples exhibit varying
sensitivities to compression, supporting the feasibility of a sample-wise
adaptive compression strategy. These insights provide a foundation for
developing a new class of storage-aware learning systems. The primary
contribution of this work is the systematic characterization of this
under-explored challenge, offering valuable insights that advance the
understanding of storage-aware learning.

Conclusion: 这些发现为广泛观察到的阶段性学习动力学和出现相变过渡现象提供了理论解释，数值实验进一步支持了这些见解。

Abstract: Motivated by empirical observations of prolonged plateaus and stage-wise
progression during training, we investigate the loss landscape of transformer
models trained on in-context next-token prediction tasks. In particular, we
focus on learning in-context $n$-gram language models under cross-entropy loss,
and establish a sufficient condition for parameter configurations to be
stationary points. We then construct a set of parameter configurations for a
simplified transformer model that represent $k$-gram estimators (for $k \leq
n$), and show that the gradient of the population loss at these solutions
vanishes in the limit of infinite sequence length and parameter norm. This
reveals a key property of the loss landscape: {sub-$n$-grams are
near-stationary points of the population cross-entropy loss}, offering
theoretical insight into widely observed phenomena such as stage-wise learning
dynamics and emergent phase transitions. These insights are further supported
by numerical experiments that illustrate the learning dynamics of $n$-grams,
characterized by discrete transitions between near-stationary solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流媒体服务快速发展导致网络负载具有高度时变性和突发性，现有预测方法要么在高峰期导致资源不足和SLA违规，要么采用保守的过度配置策略增加资源成本。

Method: 提出HRS混合表示框架，整合数值和图像表示来捕捉极端负载动态；引入调度感知损失函数(SAL)来捕获预测误差的不对称影响，更好地支持调度决策。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，HRS持续优于十个基线方法，达到最先进性能，SLA违规率降低63.1%，总利润损失减少32.3%。

Conclusion: HRS框架通过混合表示和调度感知损失有效解决了负载预测中的两难问题，在保证服务质量的同时提高了平台盈利能力。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of streaming services, network load exhibits
highly time-varying and bursty behavior, posing serious challenges for
maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms
(CCPs). While CCPs leverage Predict-then-Schedule architecture to improve QoS
and profitability, accurate load forecasting remains challenging under traffic
surges. Existing methods either minimize mean absolute error, resulting in
underprovisioning and potential Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations during
peak periods, or adopt conservative overprovisioning strategies, which mitigate
SLA risks at the expense of increased resource expenditure. To address this
dilemma, we propose HRS, a hybrid representation framework with scheduling
awareness that integrates numerical and image-based representations to better
capture extreme load dynamics. We further introduce a Scheduling-Aware Loss
(SAL) that captures the asymmetric impact of prediction errors, guiding
predictions that better support scheduling decisions. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that HRS consistently outperforms ten
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing SLA violation
rates by 63.1% and total profit loss by 32.3%.

TL;DR: TCUQ是一种面向TinyML流式应用的单次通过、无标签不确定性监测方法，通过轻量级信号捕捉时间一致性，转换为校准风险分数，在资源受限设备上显著减小内存占用和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决TinyML设备在流式应用中需要实时不确定性监测，但传统方法如early exit和深度集成计算开销大、内存占用高的问题，需要一种轻量级、无需在线标签的解决方案。

Method: 使用短时域时间一致性捕捉，通过轻量级信号处理后验和特征，转换为校准风险分数；采用O(W)环形缓冲区和O(1)每步更新；流式符合层将分数转换为预算化接受/拒绝规则。

Result: 在微控制器上，TCUQ比early exit和深度集成减少50-60%内存占用和30-45%延迟；在分布内损坏流中，准确率下降检测提升3-7 AUPRC点，最高达0.86 AUPRC；故障检测最高达0.92 AUROC。

Conclusion: 时间一致性结合流式符合校准为TinyML设备监测提供了实用且资源高效的基础，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算和内存需求。

Abstract: We introduce TCUQ, a single pass, label free uncertainty monitor for
streaming TinyML that converts short horizon temporal consistency captured via
lightweight signals on posteriors and features into a calibrated risk score
with an O(W ) ring buffer and O(1) per step updates. A streaming conformal
layer turns this score into a budgeted accept/abstain rule, yielding calibrated
behavior without online labels or extra forward passes. On microcontrollers,
TCUQ fits comfortably on kilobyte scale devices and reduces footprint and
latency versus early exit and deep ensembles (typically about 50 to 60% smaller
and about 30 to 45% faster), while methods of similar accuracy often run out of
memory. Under corrupted in distribution streams, TCUQ improves accuracy drop
detection by 3 to 7 AUPRC points and reaches up to 0.86 AUPRC at high
severities; for failure detection it attains up to 0.92 AUROC. These results
show that temporal consistency, coupled with streaming conformal calibration,
provides a practical and resource efficient foundation for on device monitoring
in TinyML.

Motivation: 现有手动设计的稀疏张量加速器局限于特定场景，且调整设计因素耗时輹边。之前的工作只关注映射或稀疏策略之一，导致设计不优

Method: 提出SparseMap框架，构建包含映射和稀疏策略的全面设计空间，采用进化策略算法，并对遗传编码和进化运算符进行一系列改进

Result: SparseMap在巨大的设计空间（如O(10^41)）中能够高效探索，持续找到更优的解决方案，表现超过之前的工作和经典优化方法

Conclusion: SparseMap通过统一优化映射和稀疏策略，有效解决了稀疏张量加速器自动设计中的组合爆炸问题，为机器学习和大数据领域提供了更高效的加速器设计方案

Abstract: The growing demand for sparse tensor algebra (SpTA) in machine learning and
big data has driven the development of various sparse tensor accelerators.
However, most existing manually designed accelerators are limited to specific
scenarios, and it's time-consuming and challenging to adjust a large number of
design factors when scenarios change. Therefore, automating the design of SpTA
accelerators is crucial. Nevertheless, previous works focus solely on either
mapping (i.e., tiling communication and computation in space and time) or
sparse strategy (i.e., bypassing zero elements for efficiency), leading to
suboptimal designs due to the lack of comprehensive consideration of both. A
unified framework that jointly optimizes both is urgently needed. However,
integrating mapping and sparse strategies leads to a combinatorial explosion in
the design space(e.g., as large as $O(10^{41})$ for the workload $P_{32 \times
64} \times Q_{64 \times 48} = Z_{32 \times 48}$). This vast search space
renders most conventional optimization methods (e.g., particle swarm
optimization, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search) inefficient.
To address this challenge, we propose an evolution strategy-based sparse tensor
accelerator optimization framework, called SparseMap. SparseMap constructing a
more comprehensive design space with the consideration of both mapping and
sparse strategy. We introduce a series of enhancements to genetic encoding and
evolutionary operators, enabling SparseMap to efficiently explore the vast and
diverse design space. We quantitatively compare SparseMap with prior works and
classical optimization methods, demonstrating that SparseMap consistently finds
superior solutions.

TL;DR: SNAP-UQ是一种面向TinyML的单次前向、无需标签的不确定性量化方法，通过深度激活预测来估计风险，显著减少资源消耗并保持高检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的不确定性量化方法在TinyML设备上存在内存占用大、延迟高的问题，需要多次前向传播或额外退出机制，不适合资源受限的微控制器部署

Method: 使用int8量化的小型预测头来预测下一层的统计特征，通过轻量级单调映射器将预测差异转换为可操作的风险分数，无需时间缓冲、辅助退出或重复前向传播

Result: 相比早期退出和深度集成方法，SNAP-UQ在视觉和音频任务上减少40-60%存储占用和25-35%延迟，在损坏数据流中AUPRC提升数个点，AUROC保持在0.9左右

Conclusion: 基于层间动态的不确定性量化为TinyML设备监控提供了实用且资源高效的基础方案，能够在单次前向传播中实现可靠的风险估计

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{SNAP-UQ}, a single-pass, label-free uncertainty method
for TinyML that estimates risk from \emph{depth-wise next-activation
prediction}: tiny int8 heads forecast the statistics of the next layer from a
compressed view of the previous one, and a lightweight monotone mapper turns
the resulting surprisal into an actionable score. The design requires no
temporal buffers, auxiliary exits, or repeated forward passes, and adds only a
few tens of kilobytes to MCU deployments. Across vision and audio backbones,
SNAP-UQ consistently reduces flash and latency relative to early-exit and deep
ensembles (typically $\sim$40--60\% smaller and $\sim$25--35\% faster), with
competing methods of similar accuracy often exceeding memory limits. In
corrupted streams it improves accuracy-drop detection by several AUPRC points
and maintains strong failure detection (AUROC $\approx$0.9) in a single pass.
Grounding uncertainty in layer-to-layer dynamics yields a practical,
resource-efficient basis for on-device monitoring in TinyML.

Abstract: We propose Fed-DPRoC, a novel federated learning framework that
simultaneously ensures differential privacy (DP), Byzantine robustness, and
communication efficiency. We introduce the concept of robust-compatible
compression, which enables users to compress DP-protected updates while
maintaining the robustness of the aggregation rule. We instantiate our
framework as RobAJoL, combining the Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform for
compression with robust averaging for robust aggregation. We theoretically
prove the compatibility of JL transform with robust averaging and show that
RobAJoL preserves robustness guarantees, ensures DP, and reduces communication
cost. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST validate our theoretical claims
and demonstrate that RobAJoL outperforms existing methods in terms of
robustness and utility under different Byzantine attacks.

Result: 在各种数据集上的广泛实验验证，SL-ACC框架达到目标精度所需时间显著少于最先进的基准方法

Conclusion: SL-ACC框架有效解决了拆分学习中的通信瓶颈问题，在保持训练精度的同时显著减少了传输时间和数据量

Abstract: The increasing complexity of neural networks poses a significant barrier to
the deployment of distributed machine learning (ML) on resource-constrained
devices, such as federated learning (FL). Split learning (SL) offers a
promising solution by offloading the primary computing load from edge devices
to a server via model partitioning. However, as the number of participating
devices increases, the transmission of excessive smashed data (i.e.,
activations and gradients) becomes a major bottleneck for SL, slowing down the
model training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a communication-efficient
SL framework, named SL-ACC, which comprises two key components: adaptive
channel importance identification (ACII) and channel grouping compression
(CGC). ACII first identifies the contribution of each channel in the smashed
data to model training using Shannon entropy. Following this, CGC groups the
channels based on their entropy and performs group-wise adaptive compression to
shrink the transmission volume without compromising training accuracy.
Extensive experiments across various datasets validate that our proposed SL-ACC
framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than
state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Method: 通过理论分析和实证研究，在合成图和真实图数据(Cora、CiteSeer、Polblogs)上实验，探索Fiedler值与GCN性能的关系，并研究不同连通分量聚合方法。

Result: Fiedler值是GCN性能的良好预测指标，相似Fiedler值的图结构特性相似，使用相同滤波器和超参数可获得相近结果，迁移学习在Fiedler值相近的图间更有效。

Conclusion: 图的代数连通性(Fiedler值)可作为GCN性能预测的重要指标，为图神经网络的设计、超参数调优和跨图迁移学习提供了新的理论基础和实践指导。

Abstract: A common observation in the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) literature is
that stacking GCN layers may or may not result in better performance on tasks
like node classification and edge prediction. We have found empirically that a
graph's algebraic connectivity, which is known as the Fiedler value, is a good
predictor of GCN performance. Intuitively, graphs with similar Fiedler values
have analogous structural properties, suggesting that the same filters and
hyperparameters may yield similar results when used with GCNs, and that
transfer learning may be more effective between graphs with similar algebraic
connectivity. We explore this theoretically and empirically with experiments on
synthetic and real graph data, including the Cora, CiteSeer and Polblogs
datasets. We explore multiple ways of aggregating the Fiedler value for
connected components in the graphs to arrive at a value for the entire graph,
and show that it can be used to predict GCN performance. We also present
theoretical arguments as to why the Fiedler value is a good predictor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer在物理问题中训练时由于边界条件变化和复合损失函数导致的梯度尖峰问题，传统Adam优化器的固定beta2参数无法有效处理这种不稳定性

Method: 将Adam中的固定beta2参数替换为基于梯度范数比率的动态值，使用"sunspike"比率（当前梯度范数除以历史EMA）来控制beta2在[0,1)区间内动态调整，梯度尖峰时降低beta2，平稳时保持高beta2

Result: 在4个测试场景中均表现出更好的稳定性和最终损失，在small-enwik8数据集上比Adam-0.95降低38%的bits-per-character，比Adam-0.999降低58%，方差更小，运行时开销与Adam相当

Conclusion: Kourkoutas-Beta保持了Adam的收敛保证，同时显著提升了在梯度尖峰情况下的鲁棒性，是一种即插即用的优化器改进方案

Abstract: Transformer neural networks are increasingly used for physics-based problems.
In data-driven PDE surrogates, training samples from varying boundary and
initial conditions can cause erratic losses and spiky gradients; in
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), stiff composite losses amplify this
effect.
  We introduce Kourkoutas-Beta, an Adam-style optimizer where the fixed
second-moment discount beta2 is replaced by a layer-wise dynamic value driven
by a bounded ``sunspike'' ratio: the current pooled gradient norm divided by an
exponential moving average (EMA) of past norms, squashed to the interval [0,1).
Spikes lower beta2 toward beta2_min; calm phases keep it near beta2_max.
Options include leaky-AMSGrad (decay), trust-region clipping (max_ratio),
adaptive tiny terms, and several bias-correction modes ``none'', ``beta2max'',
``exact'). With all features off and bias_correction=``none'', the method is
exactly Adam.
  We test on four settings: (i) a Transformer PDE surrogate (Heat2D), (ii) a 3D
PINN for heat conduction (Heat3D), (iii) a lightweight MLX synthetic task with
jitter and rare-trigger bursts, and (iv) a character-level Transformer on 30 MB
of enwik8 (small-enwik8). Kourkoutas-Beta improves stability and final loss
versus fixed-beta2 Adam. On small-enwik8 it lowers bits-per-character by about
38% vs Adam-0.95 and about 58% vs Adam-0.999 over 10 seeds, with smaller
variance. The method remains drop-in, with runtime overhead comparable to Adam
in testbeds A-C and within single-digit percent in testbed D. It preserves
Adam-style convergence guarantees while improving robustness under spiky
gradients.

Motivation: 现有多视图证据学习方法假设视图特定证据学习是可靠的，但实践中证据学习过程存在偏差，样本倾向于为数据丰富的类别分配更多证据，导致不可靠的不确定性估计

Method: 提出FAML框架：1）基于训练轨迹的自适应先验作为正则化策略校准偏差证据学习；2）基于类间证据方差的公平性约束促进平衡证据分配；3）意见对齐机制减轻视图间特定偏差

Conclusion: FAML有效解决了多视图证据学习中的偏差问题，通过系统性的偏差校准和公平性约束机制，显著提升了多视图学习的性能和可信度

Abstract: Multi-view evidential learning aims to integrate information from multiple
views to improve prediction performance and provide trustworthy uncertainty
esitimation. Most previous methods assume that view-specific evidence learning
is naturally reliable. However, in practice, the evidence learning process
tends to be biased. Through empirical analysis on real-world data, we reveal
that samples tend to be assigned more evidence to support data-rich classes,
thereby leading to unreliable uncertainty estimation in predictions. This
motivates us to delve into a new Biased Evidential Multi-view Learning (BEML)
problem. To this end, we propose Fairness-Aware Multi-view Evidential Learning
(FAML). FAML first introduces an adaptive prior based on training trajectory,
which acts as a regularization strategy to flexibly calibrate the biased
evidence learning process. Furthermore, we explicitly incorporate a fairness
constraint based on class-wise evidence variance to promote balanced evidence
allocation. In the multi-view fusion stage, we propose an opinion alignment
mechanism to mitigate view-specific bias across views, thereby encouraging the
integration of consistent and mutually supportive evidence. Extensive
experiments on five real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that FAML
achieves more balanced evidence allocation and improves both prediction
performance and the reliability of uncertainty estimation compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is crucial for the adaptation of neural network
models to new environments. Although outperforming weight-space regularisation
approaches, the functional regularisation-based CL methods suffer from high
computational costs and large linear approximation errors. In this work, we
present a new functional regularisation CL framework, called MCFRCL, which
approximates model prediction distributions by Monte Carlo (MC) sampling.
Moreover, three continuous distributions are leveraged to capture the
statistical characteristics of the MC samples via moment-based methods.
Additionally, both the Wasserstein distance and the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
distance are employed to construct the regularisation function. The proposed
MCFRCL is evaluated against multiple benchmark methods on the MNIST and CIFAR
datasets, with simulation results highlighting its effectiveness in both
prediction accuracy and training efficiency.

Result: BERT模型在多标签分类中达到了0.972的总体准确率，显著超过传统深度学习模型。HAN在特定安全标签上表现更好，但BERT在精准率和召回率方面均更优。

Abstract: Cyberattacks are increasing, and securing against such threats is costing
industries billions of dollars annually. Threat Modeling, that is,
comprehending the consequences of these attacks, can provide critical support
to cybersecurity professionals, enabling them to take timely action and
allocate resources that could be used elsewhere. Cybersecurity is heavily
dependent on threat modeling, as it assists security experts in assessing and
mitigating risks related to identifying vulnerabilities and threats. Recently,
there has been a pressing need for automated methods to assess attack
descriptions and forecast the future consequences of the increasing complexity
of cyberattacks. This study examines how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
deep learning can be applied to analyze the potential impact of cyberattacks by
leveraging textual descriptions from the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration
(CWE) database. We emphasize classifying attack consequences into five
principal categories: Availability, Access Control, Confidentiality, Integrity,
and Other. This paper investigates the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) in combination with Hierarchical
Attention Networks (HANs) for Multi-label classification, evaluating their
performance in comparison with conventional CNN and LSTM-based models.
Experimental findings show that BERT achieves an overall accuracy of $0.972$,
far higher than conventional deep learning models in multi-label
classification. HAN outperforms baseline forms of CNN and LSTM-based models on
specific cybersecurity labels. However, BERT consistently achieves better
precision and recall, making it more suitable for predicting the consequences
of a cyberattack.

TL;DR: 通过利用分离的内部数据和公开人口数据来估计模型公平性指标，解决完整数据获取困难的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、招聘、医疗等高风险领域，AI系统公平性至关重要。但实际中因法律隐私限制，难以收集完整的人口统计属性数据进行公平性测试

Method: 利用分离的数据源（内部预测属性数据+外部公开人口数据）估计可行的联合分布，计算公平性指标的可行范围

Result: 通过模拟和实验验证，能够得到有意义的公平性指标界限和可靠的真实值估计

Conclusion: 该方法为实际场景中公平性测试提供了实用有效的解决方案，解决了完整数据访问受限的挑战

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in AI systems is critical, especially in high-stakes
domains such as lending, hiring, and healthcare. This urgency is reflected in
emerging global regulations that mandate fairness assessments and independent
bias audits. However, procuring the necessary complete data for fairness
testing remains a significant challenge. In industry settings, legal and
privacy concerns restrict the collection of demographic data required to assess
group disparities, and auditors face practical and cultural challenges in
gaining access to data. In practice, data relevant for fairness testing is
often split across separate sources: internal datasets held by institutions
with predictive attributes, and external public datasets such as census data
containing protected attributes, each providing only partial, marginal
information. Our work seeks to leverage such available separate data to
estimate model fairness when complete data is inaccessible. We propose
utilising the available separate data to estimate a set of feasible joint
distributions and then compute the set plausible fairness metrics. Through
simulation and real experiments, we demonstrate that we can derive meaningful
bounds on fairness metrics and obtain reliable estimates of the true metric.
Our results demonstrate that this approach can serve as a practical and
effective solution for fairness testing in real-world settings where access to
complete data is restricted.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了FMAE和HEF两种自定义评估函数在多元时间序列预测中的表现，HEF在全局指标上更优，适合战略规划，FMAE在局部指标和运行效率上更好，适合运营效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列建模面临数据复杂性、不确定性和频繁制度转移的挑战，传统评估指标容易导致偏差并限制模型的普适性。

Method: 设计了FMAE（专注最小化绝对误差）和HEF（分层评估函数，权重全局指标并罚法大偏差）两种评估方法，在不同数据分割比例（91:9、80:20、70:30）下使用三种优化器（网格搜索、PSO、Optuna）进行实验。

Result: HEF在全局指标（R2、相对准确度、RMSE、RMSSE）上一贵表现更优，提升了模型稳健性和解释力；FMAE在局部指标（MAE、MASE）和执行时间上更优，适合短期场景。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了方法论上的权衡：HEF适用于战略规划，FMAE适用于运营效率。提出了可复现的框架来优化动态环境中的预测模型。

Abstract: Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive
environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to
market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges
due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional
evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work
compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error),
focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation
Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations.
Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30)
using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative
accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF
consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE,
RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were
confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers
advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable
for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF
is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational
efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models
in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地建模和可视化生成特定输出特征的可能参数分布，解决了高维参数空间中反向问题的挑战，为科学模拟提供了更全面的参数探索能力

Abstract: Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the
underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run
expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,
surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input
parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find
parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding
these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter
spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a
small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader
picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the
distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.
To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation
error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter
distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,
reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to
training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density
estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a
likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter
configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the
usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing
feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three
simulation datasets. Source code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for classifying and detecting spatial
commission outliers in maritime environments using seabed acoustic sensor
networks and log Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). By modeling target arrivals as
a mixture of normal and outlier processes, we estimate the probability that a
newly observed event is an outlier. We propose a second-order approximation of
this probability that incorporates both the mean and variance of the normal
intensity function, providing improved classification accuracy compared to
mean-only approaches. We analytically show that our method yields a tighter
bound to the true probability using Jensen's inequality. To enhance detection,
we integrate a real-time, near-optimal sensor placement strategy that
dynamically adjusts sensor locations based on the evolving outlier intensity.
The proposed framework is validated using real ship traffic data near Norfolk,
Virginia, where numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in improving both classification performance and outlier detection through
sensor deployment.

*Jason Hartline,Lunjia Hu,Yifan Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种完美真实的批量预测检定测量方法ATB，解决了现有检定测量在有限样本上不真实的问题，并且计算高效、实现简单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检定测量在有限样本上存在不真实性，即预测器会为了在样本上显得更检定而输出假的概率值，而不是真实概率。虽然之前有约真实的检定测量，但在批量设置下仍缺少完美真实的检定测量。

Method: 设计了平均双箱检定误差（ATB）测量方法。ATB通过一种简单的定义实现了完美真实性，同时具有声音性、完备性、连续性等特性。还提供了构造真实检定测量的通用方法。

Result: ATB在检定测试问题中实现了更快的运行时间和更简单的实现方案，远超现有的smCal和distCal方法。它与现有检定测量存在二次关系，但在真实性方面有重大改进。

Conclusion: 该研究成功构造了第一个完美真实的批量检定测量ATB，解决了预测检定领域的核心问题。ATB的简单性和高效性使得它在实践中更容易应用，为检定测试提供了更优秀的解决方案。

Abstract: Calibration requires that predictions are conditionally unbiased and,
therefore, reliably interpretable as probabilities. Calibration measures
quantify how far a predictor is from perfect calibration. As introduced by
Haghtalab et al. (2024), a calibration measure is truthful if it is minimized
in expectation when a predictor outputs the ground-truth probabilities.
Although predicting the true probabilities guarantees perfect calibration, in
reality, when calibration is evaluated on a finite sample, predicting the truth
is not guaranteed to minimize any known calibration measure. All known
calibration measures incentivize predictors to lie in order to appear more
calibrated on a finite sample. Such lack of truthfulness motivated Haghtalab et
al. (2024) and Qiao and Zhao (2025) to construct approximately truthful
calibration measures in the sequential prediction setting, but no perfectly
truthful calibration measure was known to exist even in the more basic batch
setting.
  We design a perfectly truthful calibration measure in the batch setting:
averaged two-bin calibration error (ATB). In addition to being truthful, ATB is
sound, complete, continuous, and quadratically related to two existing
calibration measures: the smooth calibration error (smCal) and the (lower)
distance to calibration (distCal). The simplicity in our definition of ATB
makes it efficient and straightforward to compute. ATB allows faster estimation
algorithms with significantly easier implementations than smCal and distCal,
achieving improved running time and simplicity for the calibration testing
problem studied by Hu et al. (2024). We also introduce a general recipe for
constructing truthful measures, which proves the truthfulness of ATB as a
special case and allows us to construct other truthful calibration measures
such as quantile-binned l_2-ECE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CGPT模型，通过因果图引导的成对Transformer架构，解决了多维时间序列建模中通道依赖与通道独立的权衡问题，实现了更好的预测精度和维度无关的适应性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业系统中多维时间序列建模存在核心权衡：通道依赖模型能捕捉特定跨变量动态但缺乏鲁棒性，通道独立模型具有通用性但无法建模显式交互。需要解决这一冲突

Method: 提出因果引导的成对Transformer(CGPT)，将已知因果图作为归纳偏置，通过成对建模范式将多维数据分解为对，使用通道无关的可学习层，在pair级别实施CD信息流，在pair间实现CI式泛化

Result: 在合成和真实工业数据集的长时和单步预测任务上验证，CGPT在预测精度上显著优于CI和CD基线，与端到端训练的CD模型性能相当，同时保持对问题维度的不可知性

Conclusion: CGPT成功解决了多维时间序列建模的CD/CI权衡问题，通过因果引导的成对架构实现了复杂系统动态的解耦，确保了可扩展性和任意变量适应性

Abstract: Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial
systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture
specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model
layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case,
while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling
the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks.
To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a
novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias.
The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the
CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model
uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are
independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at
the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach
disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible
architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate
CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term
and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial
complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI
and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with
end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem
dimensionality.

TL;DR: CRTR方法通过组合式负采样方案消除伪特征，使时间对比学习能够有效捕获时间结构，在Sokoban和魔方等复杂时间结构领域取得优异表现，首次实现仅通过学习表征高效解决任意魔方状态


<details>

Motivation: 传统AI中感知学习基于状态的表征，规划通过搜索实现时间推理。研究是否可以通过同时捕获感知和时间结构的表征来涌现时间推理能力

Method: 提出组合式时间推理表征(CRTR)，使用负采样方案可证明地消除伪特征，促进时间推理。相比标准时间对比学习，CRTR能更好地捕获时间结构

Result: 在Sokoban和魔方等复杂时间结构领域表现优异。特别是魔方任务中，CRTR学习的表征能泛化到所有初始状态，用比BestFS更少的搜索步数解决谜题（虽然解决方案更长）

Conclusion: CRTR是首个仅通过学习表征就能高效解决任意魔方状态的方法，不依赖外部搜索算法，证明了时间推理可以从同时捕获感知和时间结构的表征中涌现

Abstract: In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations,
while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action
sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such
reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual
and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,
despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its
reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial
Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative
sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate
temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex
temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the
Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial
states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,
though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that
efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,
without relying on an external search algorithm.

Abstract: Individual-level human mobility prediction has emerged as a significant topic
of research with applications in infectious disease monitoring, child, and
elderly care. Existing studies predominantly focus on the microscopic aspects
of human trajectories: such as predicting short-term trajectories or the next
location visited, while offering limited attention to macro-level mobility
patterns and the corresponding life routines. In this paper, we focus on an
underexplored problem in human mobility prediction: determining the best
practices to train a machine learning model using historical data to forecast
an individuals complete trajectory over the next days and weeks. In this
experiment paper, we undertake a comprehensive experimental analysis of diverse
models, parameter configurations, and training strategies, accompanied by an
in-depth examination of the statistical distribution inherent in human mobility
patterns. Our empirical evaluations encompass both Long Short-Term Memory and
Transformer-based architectures, and further investigate how incorporating
individual life patterns can enhance the effectiveness of the prediction. We
show that explicitly including semantic information such as day-of-the-week and
user-specific historical information can help the model better understand
individual patterns of life and improve predictions. Moreover, since the
absence of explicit user information is often missing due to user privacy, we
show that the sampling of users may exacerbate data skewness and result in a
substantial loss in predictive accuracy. To mitigate data imbalance and
preserve diversity, we apply user semantic clustering with stratified sampling
to ensure that the sampled dataset remains representative. Our results further
show that small-batch stochastic gradient optimization improves model
performance, especially when human mobility training data is limited.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出MDPO方法来解决掩码扩散语言模型训练与推理阶段的不一致问题，通过强化学习优化去噪轨迹，显著提升性能并减少训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在训练时随机掩码token，但在推理时逐步揭示序列结构，这种不一致导致性能下降，需要解决训练与推理阶段的差异。

Method: 将去噪轨迹学习建模为序列决策问题，提出Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO)方法，利用扩散的马尔可夫性质，在推理使用的渐进细化调度下显式训练模型。

Result: MDPO以60倍更少的梯度更新达到先前SOTA性能，在相同权重更新次数下，MATH500提升9.6%，Countdown提升54.2%。同时提出RCR重掩码策略作为即插即用的推理改进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MDLMs预训练与推理的不一致问题，展现了研究这一差异的巨大潜力，MDPO与RCR结合可获得额外性能增益。

Abstract: Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional
autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on
bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between
training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the
structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,
whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.
Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal
performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing
this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the
problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential
decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement
learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to
exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model
under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches
the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer
gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and
54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight
updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in
inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine
tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we
refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains
when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for
investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.

Result: 在MPE、SMAC和RWARE等合作性测试环境中，CPE显著提升了标准CTDE算法的性能，并达到了最先进RWARE实现的性能水平。

Conclusion: CPE框架通过全局中心化策略有效克服了部分观测性和扩展性问题，为多自然加强学习提供了一种高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm has
gained significant attention in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and
is the foundation of many recent algorithms. However, decentralized policies
operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance
compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically
face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases.
  We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized
training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to
overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation
equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks,
that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE
integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods,
substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across
cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the
performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.

Motivation: 现有的多智能体系统存在冗余通信和过高token开销问题，现有方法通常通过预训练GNN或贪心算法提高效率，但缺乏前后任务优化的统一策略。

Method: SafeSieve结合初始LLM语义评估和累积性能反馈，采用0-扩展聚类保持结构连贯的智能体组，同时消除无效连接，实现从启发式初始化到经验驱动优化的平滑过渡。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SafeSieve达到94.01%的平均准确率，同时减少12.4%-27.8%的token使用量，在提示注入攻击下仅下降1.23%准确率，异构设置中降低13.3%部署成本。

Conclusion: SafeSieve为实际多智能体系统提供了一个鲁棒、高效且可扩展的框架，在保持性能的同时显著降低了通信和计算成本。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but
often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead.
Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy
algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a
unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive
multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent
communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial
LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a
smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven
refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs
0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while
eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval,
etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing
token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt
injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings,
SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance.
These results establish SafeSieve as a robust, efficient, and scalable
framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found in

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents have rapidly evolved from specialized,
rule-based programs to versatile, learning-driven autonomous systems capable of
perception, reasoning, and action in complex environments. The explosion of
data, advances in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and multi-agent
coordination have accelerated this transformation. Yet, designing and deploying
unified AI agents that seamlessly integrate cognition, planning, and
interaction remains a grand challenge. In this review, we systematically
examine the architectural principles, foundational components, and emergent
paradigms that define the landscape of contemporary AI agents. We synthesize
insights from cognitive science-inspired models, hierarchical reinforcement
learning frameworks, and large language model-based reasoning. Moreover, we
discuss the pressing ethical, safety, and interpretability concerns associated
with deploying these agents in real-world scenarios. By highlighting major
breakthroughs, persistent challenges, and promising research directions, this
review aims to guide the next generation of AI agent systems toward more

Abstract: We present a novel interdisciplinary framework that bridges synchronization
theory and multi-agent AI systems by adapting the Kuramoto model to describe
the collective dynamics of heterogeneous AI agents engaged in complex task
execution. By representing AI agents as coupled oscillators with both phase and
amplitude dynamics, our model captures essential aspects of agent
specialization, influence, and communication within networked systems. We
introduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and
synchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent
diversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior.
Furthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought
prompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like
iterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive
simulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate
that increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous
agent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios. Our
physics-informed approach establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for
designing, analyzing, and optimizing scalable, adaptive, and interpretable
multi-agent AI systems. This work opens pathways for principled orchestration
of agentic AI and lays the groundwork for future incorporation of learning
dynamics and adaptive network architectures to further enhance system
resilience and efficiency.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 提出了一个五维度的分层多智能体系统分类法，涵盖控制层次、信息流、角色任务委托、时间分层和通信结构，旨在为不同方法提供比较框架而非规定最佳设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分层多智能体系统虽然能简化协调但会带来不明显的权衡，需要系统化的分类框架来统一分析和比较不同方法。

Method: 建立多维分类法，连接具体协调机制（如合同网协议、分层强化学习），并通过工业案例（电网、油田运营）进行验证。

Result: 分类法成功统一了分层MAS的结构、时间和通信维度，展示了分层结构在保持局部自治的同时实现全局效率的可能性。

Conclusion: 提出了首个统一分层MAS多维度的一体化设计框架，指出了可解释性、大规模扩展和LLM集成等开放挑战。

Abstract: Hierarchical multi-agent systems (HMAS) organize collections of agents into
layered structures that help manage complexity and scale. These hierarchies can
simplify coordination, but they also can introduce trade-offs that are not
always obvious. This paper proposes a multi-dimensional taxonomy for HMAS along
five axes: control hierarchy, information flow, role and task delegation,
temporal layering, and communication structure. The intent is not to prescribe
a single "best" design but to provide a lens for comparing different
approaches.
  Rather than treating these dimensions in isolation, the taxonomy is connected
to concrete coordination mechanisms - from the long-standing contract-net
protocol for task allocation to more recent work in hierarchical reinforcement
learning. Industrial contexts illustrate the framework, including power grids
and oilfield operations, where agents at production, maintenance, and supply
levels coordinate to diagnose well issues or balance energy demand. These cases
suggest that hierarchical structures may achieve global efficiency while
preserving local autonomy, though the balance is delicate.
  The paper closes by identifying open challenges: making hierarchical
decisions explainable to human operators, scaling to very large agent
populations, and assessing whether learning-based agents such as large language
models can be safely integrated into layered frameworks. This paper presents
what appears to be the first taxonomy that unifies structural, temporal, and
communication dimensions of hierarchical MAS into a single design framework,
bridging classical coordination mechanisms with modern reinforcement learning
and large language model agents.

TL;DR: 提出Ges-QA数据集和多模态评分网络来解决音频到3D手势生成评估问题，突破传统指标无法反映人类偏好的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频到3D手势生成任务的评估指标无法反映人类偏好，需要探索人类偏好和对象性质量评估指标

Method: 构建Ges-QA数据集（1,400个样本），包含多维度质量分数和二元分类标签；提出多模态transformer网络（视频、音频、3D骨架三分支）进行多维度评分

Result: Ges-QAer在自建数据集上达到了最先进的性能，对比实验和消融研究验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 通过Ges-QA数据集和多模态评分网络，成功解决了A2G内容质量评估的挑战，为音频到3D手势生成领域提供了更精准的人类偏好反馈

Abstract: The Audio-to-3D-Gesture (A2G) task has enormous potential for various
applications in virtual reality and computer graphics, etc. However, current
evaluation metrics, such as Fr\'echet Gesture Distance or Beat Constancy, fail
at reflecting the human preference of the generated 3D gestures. To cope with
this problem, exploring human preference and an objective quality assessment
metric for AI-generated 3D human gestures is becoming increasingly significant.
In this paper, we introduce the Ges-QA dataset, which includes 1,400 samples
with multidimensional scores for gesture quality and audio-gesture consistency.
Moreover, we collect binary classification labels to determine whether the
generated gestures match the emotions of the audio. Equipped with our Ges-QA
dataset, we propose a multi-modal transformer-based neural network with 3
branches for video, audio and 3D skeleton modalities, which can score A2G
contents in multiple dimensions. Comparative experimental results and ablation
studies demonstrate that Ges-QAer yields state-of-the-art performance on our
dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了参考图像可能具有强烈情感并与音频情感冲突的问题，导致生成结果情感不准确和扭曲。

Method: 提出跨情感记忆网络(CEM-Net)，包含音频情感增强模块(AEE)和情感桥接记忆模块(EBM)，通过跨重建训练策略增强音频情感，并利用记忆机制补偿缺失的面部运动信息。

Result: 大量实验证明CEM-Net能够合成表达力强、自然且口型同步的说话人脸视频，具有更好的情感准确性。

Conclusion: CEM-Net有效解决了参考图像与音频情感冲突的问题，显著提升了情感说话人脸生成的准确性和质量。

Abstract: Emotional talking face generation aims to animate a human face in given
reference images and generate a talking video that matches the content and
emotion of driving audio. However, existing methods neglect that reference
images may have a strong emotion that conflicts with the audio emotion, leading
to severe emotion inaccuracy and distorted generated results. To tackle the
issue, we introduce a cross-emotion memory network(CEM-Net), designed to
generate emotional talking faces aligned with the driving audio when reference
images exhibit strong emotion. Specifically, an Audio Emotion Enhancement
module(AEE) is first devised with the cross-reconstruction training strategy to
enhance audio emotion, overcoming the disruption from reference image emotion.
Secondly, since reference images cannot provide sufficient facial motion
information of the speaker under audio emotion, an Emotion Bridging Memory
module(EBM) is utilized to compensate for the lacked information. It brings in
expression displacement from the reference image emotion to the audio emotion
and stores it in the memory.Given a cross-emotion feature as a query, the
matching displacement can be retrieved at inference time. Extensive experiments
have demonstrated that our CEM-Net can synthesize expressive, natural and
lip-synced talking face videos with better emotion accuracy.

Conclusion: MAGNeT有效解决了移动目标选择在多样化多媒体环境中的适应性问题，通过多模态上下文感知融合实现了良好的少样本性能和模型可解释性。

Abstract: Moving target selection in multimedia interactive systems faces unprecedented
challenges as users increasingly interact across diverse and dynamic
contexts-from live streaming in moving vehicles to VR gaming in varying
environments. Existing approaches rely on probabilistic models that relate
endpoint distribution to target properties such as size and speed. However,
these methods require substantial training data for each new context and lack
transferability across scenarios, limiting their practical deployment in
diverse multimedia environments where rich multimodal contextual information is
readily available. This paper introduces MAGNeT (Multimodal Adaptive Gaussian
Networks), which addresses these problems by combining classical statistical
modeling with a context-aware multimodal method. MAGNeT dynamically fuses
pre-fitted Ternary-Gaussian models from various scenarios based on real-time
contextual cues, enabling effective adaptation with minimal training data while
preserving model interpretability. We conduct experiments on self-constructed
2D and 3D moving target selection datasets under in-vehicle vibration
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGNeT achieves lower error
rates with few-shot samples by applying context-aware fusion of Gaussian
experts from multi-factor conditions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨如何将大型语言模型(LLMs)与物理机器人集成，以改善机器人的人机语言交互能力，实现更自然的人机协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交互式任务学习(ITL)系统的语言理解能力有限，而大型语言模型的出现为提升机器人的语言理解提供了机会，但将LLMs与物理机器人集成面临挑战。

Method: 提出一种以认知代理为核心控制物理机器人的AI系统，该系统与人类和LLM交互，并通过经验积累情境知识。进行了三个使用ChatGPT的概念验证实验。

Result: 通过简单的概念验证实验展示了使用ChatGPT进行自然语言理解的可行性，但需要进一步开发才能转化为可操作的系统。

Conclusion: 需要将LLM辅助的语言理解整合到完整的机器人助手中，才能实现使用语言与人类协作的愿景，这需要解决多个技术挑战。

Abstract: We have a vision of a day when autonomous robots can collaborate with humans
as assistants in performing complex tasks in the physical world. This vision
includes that the robots will have the ability to communicate with their human
collaborators using language that is natural to the humans. Traditional
Interactive Task Learning (ITL) systems have some of this ability, but the
language they can understand is very limited. The advent of large language
models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to greatly improve the language
understanding of robots, yet integrating the language abilities of LLMs with
robots that operate in the real physical world is a challenging problem.
  In this chapter we first review briefly a few commercial robot products that
work closely with humans, and discuss how they could be much better
collaborators with robust language abilities. We then explore how an AI system
with a cognitive agent that controls a physical robot at its core, interacts
with both a human and an LLM, and accumulates situational knowledge through its
experiences, can be a possible approach to reach that vision. We focus on three
specific challenges of having the robot understand natural language, and
present a simple proof-of-concept experiment using ChatGPT for each. Finally,
we discuss what it will take to turn these simple experiments into an
operational system where LLM-assisted language understanding is a part of an
integrated robotic assistant that uses language to collaborate with humans.

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现用户与机器人在高速任务中的无缝同步，同时保持机器人的平衡稳定性和地形适应能力。

Abstract: Achieving seamless synchronization between user and robot motion in
teleoperation, particularly during high-speed tasks, remains a significant
challenge. In this work, we propose a novel approach for transferring stepping
motions from the user to the robot in real-time. Instead of directly
replicating user foot poses, we retarget user steps to robot footstep
locations, allowing the robot to utilize its own dynamics for locomotion,
ensuring better balance and stability. Our method anticipates user footsteps to
minimize delays between when the user initiates and completes a step and when
the robot does it. The step estimates are continuously adapted to converge with
the measured user references. Additionally, the system autonomously adjusts the
robot's steps to account for its surrounding terrain, overcoming challenges
posed by environmental mismatches between the user's flat-ground setup and the
robot's uneven terrain. Experimental results on the humanoid robot Nadia
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统强化学习方法在处理长序列依赖、高分辨率图像输入时的计算效率低下和内存占用大的问题，同时提升在复杂地形和动态障碍物环境中的导航性能。

Method: 1. 使用多层感知机嵌入本体感知状态，轻量CNN处理深度图像生成紧凑token；2. 堆叠Mamba层通过选择性扫描融合token，实现近线性时间建模；3. 使用PPO算法在随机化地形和外观下进行端到端训练，采用障碍物密度课程学习和紧凑状态奖励函数。

Result: 在具有静态/动态障碍物和不平地形的挑战性仿真环境中，相比SOTA基线方法，LocoMamba获得更高回报和成功率，碰撞更少，对未见地形和障碍物密度有更强泛化能力，训练效率更高（相同计算预算下收敛更快）。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架通过选择性状态空间模型有效解决了长序列建模的计算效率问题，在复杂导航任务中展现出卓越的性能、泛化能力和训练效率，为视觉驱动的强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of machine learning technologies in autonomous
driving systems, their role in addressing complex environmental perception
challenges has become increasingly crucial. However, existing machine learning
models exhibit significant vulnerability, as their performance critically
depends on the fundamental assumption that training and testing data satisfy
the independent and identically distributed condition, which is difficult to
guarantee in real-world applications. Dynamic variations in data distribution
caused by seasonal changes, weather fluctuations lead to data shift problems in
autonomous driving systems. This study investigates the data shift problem in
autonomous driving object detection tasks, systematically analyzing its
complexity and diverse manifestations. We conduct a comprehensive review of
data shift detection methods and employ shift detection analysis techniques to
perform dataset categorization and balancing. Building upon this foundation, we
construct an object detection model. To validate our approach, we optimize the
model by integrating CycleGAN-based data augmentation techniques with the
YOLOv5 framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance compared to baseline models on the BDD100K dataset.

Abstract: The ocean vast unexplored regions and diverse soft-bodied marine organisms
have spurred interest in bio-inspired underwater soft robotics. Recent advances
have enabled new capabilities in underwater movement, sensing, and interaction.
However, these efforts are largely unidirectional, with biology guiding
robotics while insights from robotics rarely feed back into biology. Here we
propose a holistic, bidirectional framework that integrates biological
principles, robotic implementation, and biological validation. We show that
soft robots can serve as experimental tools to probe biological functions and
even test evolutionary hypotheses. Their inherent compliance also allows them
to outperform rigid systems in unstructured environments, supporting
applications in marine exploration, manipulation, and medicine. Looking
forward, we introduce bio-universal-inspired robotics, a paradigm that
transcends species-specific mimicry by identifying convergent principles across
species to inspire more adaptable designs. Despite rapid progress, challenges
persist in material robustness, actuation efficiency, autonomy, and
intelligence. By uniting biology and engineering, soft robots can advance ocean

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent the cutting edge of robotics research, yet their
potential in entertainment remains largely unexplored. Entertainment as a field
prioritizes visuals and form, a principle that contrasts with the purely
functional designs of most contemporary humanoid robots. Designing
entertainment humanoid robots capable of fluid movement presents a number of

the look and mannerisms of its namesake character from Netflix's movie The
Electric State. Kid Cosmo is a child-sized humanoid robot, standing 1.45 m tall
and weighing 25 kg. It contains 28 degrees of freedom and primarily uses
proprioceptive actuators, enabling torque-control walking and lifelike motion
generation. Following worldwide showcases as part of the movie's press tour, we
present the system architecture, challenges of a functional entertainment robot
and unique solutions, and our initial findings on stability during simultaneous
upper and lower body movement. We demonstrate the viability of
performance-oriented humanoid robots that prioritize both character embodiment

Abstract: The human foot serves as the critical interface between the body and
environment during locomotion. Existing musculoskeletal models typically
oversimplify foot-ground contact mechanics, limiting their ability to
accurately simulate human gait dynamics. We developed a novel contact-rich and
deformable model of the human foot integrated within a complete musculoskeletal
system that captures the complex biomechanical interactions during walking. To
overcome the control challenges inherent in modeling multi-point contacts and
deformable material, we developed a two-stage policy training strategy to learn
natural walking patterns for this interface-enhanced model. Comparative
analysis between our approach and conventional rigid musculoskeletal models
demonstrated improvements in kinematic, kinetic, and gait stability metrics.
Validation against human subject data confirmed that our simulation closely
reproduced real-world biomechanical measurements. This work advances
contact-rich interface modeling for human musculoskeletal systems and
establishes a robust framework that can be extended to humanoid robotics
applications requiring precise foot-ground interaction control.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous driving systems promises to transform transportation
by enhancing safety, efficiency, and comfort. As these technologies evolve
toward higher levels of autonomy, the need for integrated systems that
seamlessly support human involvement in decision-making becomes increasingly
critical. Certain scenarios necessitate human involvement, including those
where the vehicle is unable to identify an object or element in the scene, and
as such cannot take independent action. Therefore, situational awareness is
essential to mitigate potential risks during a takeover, where a driver must
assume control and autonomy from the vehicle. The need for driver attention is
important to avoid collisions with external agents and ensure a smooth
transition during takeover operations. This paper explores the integration of
attention redirection techniques, such as gaze manipulation through targeted
visual and auditory cues, to help drivers maintain focus on emerging hazards
and reduce target fixation in semi-autonomous driving scenarios. We propose a
conceptual framework that combines real-time gaze tracking, context-aware
saliency analysis, and synchronized visual and auditory alerts to enhance
situational awareness, proactively address potential hazards, and foster
effective collaboration between humans and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Modern autonomous drone missions increasingly require software frameworks
capable of seamlessly integrating structured symbolic planning with adaptive
reinforcement learning (RL). Although traditional rule-based architectures
offer robust structured reasoning for drone autonomy, their capabilities fall
short in dynamically complex operational environments that require adaptive
symbolic planning. Symbolic RL (SRL), using the Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL), explicitly integrates domain-specific knowledge and
operational constraints, significantly improving the reliability and safety of
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) decision making. In this study, we propose the
AMAD-SRL framework, an extended and refined version of the Autonomous Mission
Agents for Drones (AMAD) cognitive multi-agent architecture, enhanced with
symbolic reinforcement learning for dynamic mission planning and execution. We
validated our framework in a Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) environment structured
identically to an intended Hardware-In-the-Loop Simulation (HILS) platform,
ensuring seamless transition to real hardware. Experimental results demonstrate
stable integration and interoperability of modules, successful transitions
between BDI-driven and symbolic RL-driven planning phases, and consistent
mission performance. Specifically, we evaluate a target acquisition scenario in
which the UAV plans a surveillance path followed by a dynamic reentry path to
secure the target while avoiding threat zones. In this SIL evaluation, mission
efficiency improved by approximately 75% over a coverage-based baseline,
measured by travel distance reduction. This study establishes a robust
foundation for handling complex UAV missions and discusses directions for
further enhancement and validation.

Conclusion: OmniD通过有效的多视角融合和特征选择机制，显著提升了视觉运动策略的泛化能力和性能表现。

Abstract: The visuomotor policy can easily overfit to its training datasets, such as
fixed camera positions and backgrounds. This overfitting makes the policy
perform well in the in-distribution scenarios but underperform in the
out-of-distribution generalization. Additionally, the existing methods also
have difficulty fusing multi-view information to generate an effective 3D
representation. To tackle these issues, we propose Omni-Vision Diffusion Policy
(OmniD), a multi-view fusion framework that synthesizes image observations into
a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) representation. We introduce a deformable
attention-based Omni-Feature Generator (OFG) to selectively abstract
task-relevant features while suppressing view-specific noise and background
distractions. OmniD achieves 11\%, 17\%, and 84\% average improvement over the
best baseline model for in-distribution, out-of-distribution, and few-shot
experiments, respectively. Training code and simulation benchmark are

Abstract: Legged robots possess a unique ability to traverse rough terrains and
navigate cluttered environments, making them well-suited for complex,
real-world unstructured scenarios. However, such robots have not yet achieved
the same level as seen in natural systems. Recently, sampling-based predictive
controllers have demonstrated particularly promising results. This paper
investigates a sampling-based model predictive strategy combining model
predictive path integral (MPPI) with cross-entropy (CE) and covariance matrix
adaptation (CMA) methods to generate real-time whole-body motions for legged
robots across multiple scenarios. The results show that combining the benefits
of MPPI, CE and CMA, namely using model predictive optimized path integral
(MPOPI), demonstrates greater sample efficiency, enabling robots to attain
superior locomotion results using fewer samples when compared to typical MPPI
algorithms. Extensive simulation experiments in multiple scenarios on a
quadruped robot show that MPOPI can be used as an anytime control strategy,
increasing locomotion capabilities at each iteration.

Conclusion: ExploreVLM通过闭环任务规划和结构化感知实现了鲁棒高效的任务执行，为机器人动态环境适应提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The advancement of embodied intelligence is accelerating the integration of
robots into daily life as human assistants. This evolution requires robots to
not only interpret high-level instructions and plan tasks but also perceive and
adapt within dynamic environments. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) present a
promising solution by combining visual understanding and language reasoning.
However, existing VLM-based methods struggle with interactive exploration,
accurate perception, and real-time plan adaptation. To address these
challenges, we propose ExploreVLM, a novel closed-loop task planning framework
powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The framework is built around a
step-wise feedback mechanism that enables real-time plan adjustment and
supports interactive exploration. At its core is a dual-stage task planner with
self-reflection, enhanced by an object-centric spatial relation graph that
provides structured, language-grounded scene representations to guide
perception and planning. An execution validator supports the closed loop by
verifying each action and triggering re-planning. Extensive real-world
experiments demonstrate that ExploreVLM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in exploration-centric tasks. Ablation
studies further validate the critical role of the reflective planner and
structured perception in achieving robust and efficient task execution.

Abstract: Effective bipedal locomotion in dynamic environments, such as cluttered
indoor spaces or uneven terrain, requires agile and adaptive movement in all
directions. This necessitates omnidirectional terrain sensing and a controller
capable of processing such input. We present a learning framework for
vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion, enabling seamless movement
using depth images. A key challenge is the high computational cost of rendering
omnidirectional depth images in simulation, making traditional sim-to-real
reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. Our method combines a robust blind
controller with a teacher policy that supervises a vision-based student policy,
trained on noise-augmented terrain data to avoid rendering costs during RL and
ensure robustness. We also introduce a data augmentation technique for
supervised student training, accelerating training by up to 10 times compared
to conventional methods. Our framework is validated through simulation and
real-world tests, demonstrating effective omnidirectional locomotion with
minimal reliance on expensive rendering. This is, to the best of our knowledge,
the first demonstration of vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion,
showcasing its adaptability to diverse terrains.

Abstract: Agile and human-centric manufacturing stipulates resilient robotic solutions
capable of contextual reasoning and safe interaction in unstructured
environments. Foundation models particularly the Vision Language Action (VLA)
models have emerged to fuse multimodal perception, reasoning and physically
grounded action across varied embodiments into unified representation, termed
as General Physical Intelligence (GPI). While GPI has already been described in
the literature but its practical application and evolving role in contemporary
agile manufacturing processes have yet to be duly explored. To bridge this gap,
this practical review systematically surveys recent advancements in VLA models
within GPI context, performs comprehensive comparative analysis of leading
implementations and evaluates their readiness for industrial deployment through
structured ablation study. Our analysis has organized state-of-the-art into
five thematic pillars including multisensory representation learning, sim2real
transfer, planning and control, uncertainty and safety measures and
benchmarking. Finally, we articulate open research challenges and propose
directions to better integrate GPI into next-generation industrial ecosystems

Abstract: This study proposes a hybrid curriculum reinforcement learning (CRL)
framework based on a fully spiking neural network (SNN) for 9-degree-of-freedom
robotic arms performing target reaching and grasping tasks. To reduce network
complexity and inference latency, the SNN architecture is simplified to include
only an input and an output layer, which shows strong potential for
resource-constrained environments. Building on the advantages of SNNs-high
inference speed, low energy consumption, and spike-based biological
plausibility, a temporal progress-partitioned curriculum strategy is integrated
with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Meanwhile, an energy
consumption modeling framework is introduced to quantitatively compare the
theoretical energy consumption between SNNs and conventional Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs). A dynamic two-stage reward adjustment mechanism and optimized
observation space further improve learning efficiency and policy accuracy.
Experiments on the Isaac Gym simulation platform demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior performance under realistic physical constraints.
Comparative evaluations with conventional PPO and ANN baselines validate the
scalability and energy efficiency of the proposed approach in dynamic robotic
manipulation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in unmanned systems has
significantly enhanced the semantic understanding and autonomous task execution
capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms. However, limited
communication bandwidth and the need for high-frequency interactions pose
severe challenges to semantic information transmission within the swarm. This
paper explores the feasibility of LLM-driven UAV swarms for autonomous semantic
compression communication, aiming to reduce communication load while preserving
critical task semantics. To this end, we construct four types of 2D simulation
scenarios with different levels of environmental complexity and design a
communication-execution pipeline that integrates system prompts with task
instruction prompts. On this basis, we systematically evaluate the semantic
compression performance of nine mainstream LLMs in different scenarios and
analyze their adaptability and stability through ablation studies on
environmental complexity and swarm size. Experimental results demonstrate that
LLM-based UAV swarms have the potential to achieve efficient collaborative
communication under bandwidth-constrained and multi-hop link conditions.

Abstract: High resolution underwater 3D scene reconstruction is crucial for various
applications, including construction, infrastructure maintenance, monitoring,
exploration, and scientific investigation. Prior work has leveraged the
complementary sensing modalities of imaging sonars and optical cameras for
opti-acoustic 3D scene reconstruction, demonstrating improved results over
methods which rely solely on either sensor. However, while most existing
approaches focus on offline reconstruction, real-time spatial awareness is
essential for both autonomous and piloted underwater vehicle operations. This
paper presents OASIS, an opti-acoustic fusion method that integrates data from
optical images with voxel carving techniques to achieve real-time 3D
reconstruction unstructured underwater workspaces. Our approach utilizes an
"eye-in-hand" configuration, which leverages the dexterity of robotic
manipulator arms to capture multiple workspace views across a short baseline.
We validate OASIS through tank-based experiments and present qualitative and
quantitative results that highlight its utility for underwater manipulation
tasks.

Abstract: Robots equipped with rich sensor suites can localize reliably in
partially-observable environments, but powering every sensor continuously is
wasteful and often infeasible. Belief-space planners address this by
propagating pose-belief covariance through analytic models and switching
sensors heuristically--a brittle, runtime-expensive approach. Data-driven
approaches--including diffusion models--learn multi-modal trajectories from
demonstrations, but presuppose an accurate, always-on state estimate. We
address the largely open problem: for a given task in a mapped environment,
which \textit{minimal sensor subset} must be active at each location to
maintain state uncertainty \textit{just low enough} to complete the task? Our
key insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a
pose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories
yields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error.
Building on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion
(B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a
short-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for
localisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts. We show that this
single proxy suffices for a soft-actor-critic to choose sensors online,
optimising energy while bounding pose-covariance growth. We deploy B-COD in
real-time marine trials on an unmanned surface vehicle and show that it reduces
sensing energy consumption while matching the goal-reach performance of an
always-on baseline.

Abstract: This study presents a systematic literature review of software-level
approaches to energy efficiency in robotics published from 2020 through 2024,
updating and extending pre-2020 evidence. An automated-but-audited pipeline
combined Google Scholar seeding, backward/forward snowballing, and
large-language-model (LLM) assistance for screening and data extraction, with
~10% human audits at each automated step and consensus-with-tie-breaks for
full-text decisions. The final corpus comprises 79 peer-reviewed studies
analyzed across application domain, metrics, evaluation type, energy models,
major energy consumers, software technique families, and energy-quality
trade-offs. Industrial settings dominate (31.6%) followed by exploration
(25.3%). Motors/actuators are identified as the primary consumer in 68.4% of
studies, with computing/controllers a distant second (13.9%). Simulation-only
evaluations remain most common (51.9%), though hybrid evaluations are frequent
(25.3%). Representational (physics-grounded) energy models predominate (87.3%).
Motion and trajectory optimization is the leading technique family (69.6%),
often paired with learning/prediction (40.5%) and computation
allocation/scheduling (26.6%); power management/idle control (11.4%) and
communication/data efficiency (3.8%) are comparatively underexplored. Reporting
is heterogeneous: composite objectives that include energy are most common,
while task-normalized and performance-per-energy metrics appear less often,
limiting cross-paper comparability. The review offers a minimal reporting
checklist (e.g., total energy and average power plus a task-normalized metric
and clear baselines) and highlights opportunities in cross-layer designs and in
quantifying non-performance trade-offs (accuracy, stability). A replication
package with code, prompts, and frozen datasets accompanies the review.

Abstract: Generating sequences of human-like motions for humanoid robots presents
challenges in collecting and analyzing reference human motions, synthesizing
new motions based on these reference motions, and mapping the generated motion
onto humanoid robots. To address these issues, we introduce SynSculptor, a
humanoid motion analysis and editing framework that leverages postural
synergies for training-free human-like motion scripting. To analyze human
motion, we collect 3+ hours of motion capture data across 20 individuals where
a real-time operational space controller mimics human motion on a simulated
humanoid robot. The major postural synergies are extracted using principal
component analysis (PCA) for velocity trajectories segmented by changes in
robot momentum, constructing a style-conditioned synergy library for free-space
motion generation. To evaluate generated motions using the synergy library, the
foot-sliding ratio and proposed metrics for motion smoothness involving total
momentum and kinetic energy deviations are computed for each generated motion,
and compared with reference motions. Finally, we leverage the synergies with a
motion-language transformer, where the humanoid, during execution of motion
tasks with its end-effectors, adapts its posture based on the chosen synergy.

Abstract: Recent works have shown the promise of inference-time search over action
samples for improving generative robot policies. In particular, optimizing
cross-chunk coherence via bidirectional decoding has proven effective in
boosting the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies. However, this
approach remains computationally expensive as the diversity of sampled actions
grows. In this paper, we introduce self-guided action diffusion, a more
efficient variant of bidirectional decoding tailored for diffusion-based
policies. At the core of our method is to guide the proposal distribution at
each diffusion step based on the prior decision. Experiments in simulation
tasks show that the proposed self-guidance enables near-optimal performance at
negligible inference cost. Notably, under a tight sampling budget, our method
achieves up to 70% higher success rates than existing counterparts on
challenging dynamic tasks. See project website at

Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型在零样本部署到分布外场景时经常产生脆弱行为或不安全故障，需要一种方法来提高其在机器人任务中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation
for generalist robot policies, but often produce brittle behaviours or unsafe
failures when deployed zero-shot in out-of-distribution scenarios. We present
Vision-Language-Action Planning & Search (VLAPS) -- a novel framework and
accompanying algorithms that embed model-based search into the inference
procedure of pre-trained VLA policies to improve their performance on robotic
tasks. Specifically, our method biases a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) algorithm -- run using a model of the target environment -- using action
priors defined by the VLA policy. By using VLA-derived abstractions and priors
in model-based search, VLAPS efficiently explores language-conditioned robotics
tasks whose search spaces would otherwise be intractably large. Conversely, by
integrating model-based search with the VLA policy's inference procedure, VLAPS
yields behaviours that are more performant than those obtained by directly
following the VLA policy's action predictions. VLAPS offers a principled
framework to: i) control test-time compute in VLA models, ii) leverage a priori
knowledge of the robotic environment, and iii) integrate established planning
and reinforcement learning techniques into the VLA inference process. Across

Abstract: Simulation-based reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced
humanoid locomotion tasks, yet direct real-world RL from scratch or adapting
from pretrained policies remains rare, limiting the full potential of humanoid
robots. Real-world learning, despite being crucial for overcoming the
sim-to-real gap, faces substantial challenges related to safety, reward design,
and learning efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose
Robot-Trains-Robot (RTR), a novel framework where a robotic arm teacher
actively supports and guides a humanoid robot student. The RTR system provides
protection, learning schedule, reward, perturbation, failure detection, and
automatic resets. It enables efficient long-term real-world humanoid training
with minimal human intervention. Furthermore, we propose a novel RL pipeline
that facilitates and stabilizes sim-to-real transfer by optimizing a single
dynamics-encoded latent variable in the real world. We validate our method
through two challenging real-world humanoid tasks: fine-tuning a walking policy
for precise speed tracking and learning a humanoid swing-up task from scratch,
illustrating the promising capabilities of real-world humanoid learning
realized by RTR-style systems. See https://robot-trains-robot.github.io/ for

Abstract: Robot-assisted dressing is a popular but challenging topic in the field of
robotic manipulation, offering significant potential to improve the quality of
life for individuals with mobility limitations. Currently, the majority of
research on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting
clothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since
the armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing
task successfully. However, for the latter, dressing with a single robotic arm
often fails due to the narrower armscye and the property of diminishing
rigidity in the armscye, which eventually causes the armscye to get stuck. This
paper proposes a bimanual dressing strategy suitable for dressing tight-fitting
clothing. To facilitate the encoding of dressing trajectories that adapt to
different human arm postures, a spherical coordinate system for dressing is
established. We uses the azimuthal angle of the spherical coordinate system as
a task-relevant feature for bimanual manipulation. Based on this new
coordinate, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture
Regression (GMR) for imitation learning of bimanual dressing trajectories,
generating dressing strategies that adapt to different human arm postures. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through various experiments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于力视觉融合控制器驱动的多任务强化学习方法（FVFC-MTRL），用于机器人批量精密装配任务中的稳健处理不确定配合类型和配合量的问题。

Motivation: 在高精度工业应用中，机器人需要处理批量制造的棒和孔组件的精密装配任务。由于机加工误差，这些组件可能存在不确定的配合类型（间隙配合或过渡配合）和配合量，需要稳健的处理策略。

Method: 提出了力视觉融合控制器驱动的多任务强化学习方法（FVFC-MTRL），将批量装配任务分解为多个确定性子任务，并使用多教师策略萃取方法将多个训练好的策略整合到一个统一的学生网络中。

Abstract: In some high-precision industrial applications, robots are deployed to
perform precision assembly tasks on mass batches of manufactured pegs and
holes. If the peg and hole are designed with transition fit, machining errors
may lead to either a clearance or an interference fit for a specific pair of
components, with uncertain fit amounts. This paper focuses on the robotic batch
precision assembly task involving components with uncertain fit types and fit
amounts, and proposes an efficient methodology to construct the robust and
compliant assembly control strategy. Specifically, the batch precision assembly
task is decomposed into multiple deterministic subtasks, and a force-vision
fusion controller-driven reinforcement learning method and a multi-task
reinforcement learning training method (FVFC-MTRL) are proposed to jointly
learn multiple compliance control strategies for these subtasks. Subsequently,
the multi-teacher policy distillation approach is designed to integrate
multiple trained strategies into a unified student network, thereby
establishing a robust control strategy. Real-world experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method successfully constructs the robust control strategy for
high-precision assembly task with different fit types and fit amounts.
Moreover, the MTRL framework significantly improves training efficiency, and
the final developed control strategy achieves superior force compliance and
higher success rate compared with many existing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a prediction algorithm that estimates the vehicle
trajectory every five milliseconds for an autonomous vehicle. A kinematic and a
dynamic bicycle model are compared, with the dynamic model exhibiting superior
accuracy at higher speeds. Vehicle parameters such as mass, center of gravity,
moment of inertia, and cornering stiffness are determined experimentally. For
cornering stiffness, a novel measurement procedure using optical position
tracking is introduced. The model is incorporated into an extended Kalman
filter and implemented in a ROS node in C++. The algorithm achieves a
positional deviation of only 1.25 cm per meter over the entire test drive and
is up to 82.6% more precise than the kinematic model.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理半无限规划碰撞避免问题，支持鲁棒控制和实际应用，为紧密空间导航提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for collision avoidance in optimal and
model predictive control, in which the environment is represented by a large
number of points and the robot as a union of padded polygons. The conditions
that none of the points shall collide with the robot can be written in terms of
an infinite number of constraints per obstacle point. We show that the
resulting semi-infinite programming (SIP) optimal control problem (OCP) can be
efficiently tackled through a combination of two methods: local reduction and
an external active-set method. Specifically, this involves iteratively
identifying the closest point obstacles, determining the lower-level distance
minimizer among all feasible robot shape parameters, and solving the
upper-level finitely-constrained subproblems.
  In addition, this paper addresses robust collision avoidance in the presence
of ellipsoidal state uncertainties. Enforcing constraint satisfaction over all
possible uncertainty realizations extends the dimension of constraint
infiniteness. The infinitely many constraints arising from translational
uncertainty are handled by local reduction together with the robot shape
parameterization, while rotational uncertainty is addressed via a backoff
reformulation.
  A controller implemented based on the proposed method is demonstrated on a
real-world robot running at 20Hz, enabling fast and collision-free navigation
in tight spaces. An application to 3D collision avoidance is also demonstrated
in simulation.

Result: 实现了无人机的自主探索、避障和图像目标寻找等综合导航行为，无需显式全局建图。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机图像目标导航提供了一种有效的sim-to-real解决方案，支持复杂环境下的安全自主导航。

Abstract: Image-goal navigation (ImageNav) tasks a robot with autonomously exploring an
unknown environment and reaching a location that visually matches a given
target image. While prior works primarily study ImageNav for ground robots,
enabling this capability for autonomous drones is substantially more
challenging due to their need for high-frequency feedback control and global
localization for stable flight. In this paper, we propose a novel sim-to-real
framework that leverages visual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve ImageNav
for drones. To enhance visual representation ability, our approach trains the
vision backbone with auxiliary tasks, including image perturbations and future
transition prediction, which results in more effective policy training. The
proposed algorithm enables end-to-end ImageNav with direct velocity control,
eliminating the need for external localization. Furthermore, we integrate a
depth-based safety module for real-time obstacle avoidance, allowing the drone
to safely navigate in cluttered environments. Unlike most existing drone
navigation methods that focus solely on reference tracking or obstacle
avoidance, our framework supports comprehensive navigation
behaviors--autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and image-goal
seeking--without requiring explicit global mapping. Code and model checkpoints
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: While gesture recognition using vision or robot skins is an active research
area in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), this paper explores deep learning
methods relying solely on a robot's built-in joint sensors, eliminating the
need for external sensors. We evaluated various convolutional neural network
(CNN) architectures and collected two datasets to study the impact of data
representation and model architecture on the recognition accuracy. Our results
show that spectrogram-based representations significantly improve accuracy,
while model architecture plays a smaller role. We also tested generalization to
new robot poses, where spectrogram-based models performed better. Implemented
on a Franka Emika Research robot, two of our methods, STFT2DCNN and STT3DCNN,
achieved over 95% accuracy in contact detection and gesture classification.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of external-sensor-free tactile

Abstract: Reasoning about rolling and sliding contact, or roll-slide contact for short,
is critical for dexterous manipulation tasks that involve intricate geometries.
But existing works on roll-slide contact mostly focus on continuous shapes with
differentiable parametrizations. This work extends roll-slide contact modeling
to manifold meshes. Specifically, we present an integration scheme based on
geodesic tracing to first-order time-integrate roll-slide contact directly on
meshes, enabling dexterous manipulation to reason over high-fidelity discrete
representations of an object's true geometry. Using our method, we planned
dexterous motions of a multi-finger robotic hand manipulating five objects
in-hand in simulation. The planning was achieved with a least-squares optimizer
that strives to maintain the most stable instantaneous grasp by minimizing
contact sliding and spinning. Then, we evaluated our method against a baseline
using collision detection and a baseline using primitive shapes. The results
show that our method performed the best in accuracy and precision, even for
coarse meshes. We conclude with a future work discussion on incorporating
multiple contacts and contact forces to achieve accurate and robust mesh-based
surface contact modeling.

Abstract: Marine oil spills pose grave environmental and economic risks, threatening
marine ecosystems, coastlines, and dependent industries. Predicting and
managing oil spill trajectories is highly complex, due to the interplay of
physical, chemical, and environmental factors such as wind, currents, and
temperature, which makes timely and effective response challenging. Accurate
real-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for
minimizing the impact of these disasters. This study introduces an integrated
framework combining a multi-agent swarm robotics system built on the MOOS-IvP
platform with Liquid Time-Constant Neural Networks (LTCNs). The proposed system
fuses adaptive machine learning with autonomous marine robotics, enabling
real-time prediction, dynamic tracking, and rapid response to evolving oil
spills. By leveraging LTCNs--well-suited for modeling complex, time-dependent
processes--the framework achieves real-time, high-accuracy forecasts of spill
movement. Swarm intelligence enables decentralized, scalable, and resilient
decision-making among robot agents, enhancing collective monitoring and
containment efforts. Our approach was validated using data from the Deepwater
Horizon spill, where the LTC-RK4 model achieved 0.96 spatial accuracy,
surpassing LSTM approaches by 23%. The integration of advanced neural modeling
with autonomous, coordinated robotics demonstrates substantial improvements in
prediction precision, flexibility, and operational scalability. Ultimately,
this research advances the state-of-the-art for sustainable, autonomous oil
spill management and environmental protection by enhancing both trajectory
prediction and response coordination.

Abstract: We introduce PROD (Palpative Reconstruction of Deformables), a novel method
for reconstructing the shape and mechanical properties of deformable objects
using elastostatic signed distance functions (SDFs). Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on purely geometric or visual data, PROD integrates
palpative interaction -- measured through force-controlled surface probing --
to estimate both the static and dynamic response of soft materials. We model
the deformation of an object as an elastostatic process and derive a governing
Poisson equation for estimating its SDF from a sparse set of pose and force
measurements. By incorporating steady-state elastodynamic assumptions, we show
that the undeformed SDF can be recovered from deformed observations with
provable convergence. Our approach also enables the estimation of material
stiffness by analyzing displacement responses to varying force inputs. We
demonstrate the robustness of PROD in handling pose errors, non-normal force
application, and curvature errors in simulated soft body interactions. These
capabilities make PROD a powerful tool for reconstructing deformable objects in
applications ranging from robotic manipulation to medical imaging and haptic
feedback systems.

Abstract: Event cameras generate asynchronous signals in response to pixel-level
brightness changes, offering a sensing paradigm with theoretically
microsecond-scale latency that can significantly enhance the performance of
multi-sensor systems. Extrinsic calibration is a critical prerequisite for
effective sensor fusion; however, the configuration that involves event cameras
remains an understudied topic. In this paper, we propose a motion-based
temporal and rotational calibration framework tailored for event-centric
multi-sensor systems, eliminating the need for dedicated calibration targets.
Our method uses as input the rotational motion estimates obtained from event
cameras and other heterogeneous sensors, respectively. Different from
conventional approaches that rely on event-to-frame conversion, our method
efficiently estimates angular velocity from normal flow observations, which are
derived from the spatio-temporal profile of event data. The overall calibration
pipeline adopts a two-step approach: it first initializes the temporal offset
and rotational extrinsics by exploiting kinematic correlations in the spirit of
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and then refines both temporal and
rotational parameters through a joint non-linear optimization using a
continuous-time parametrization in SO(3). Extensive evaluations on both
publicly available and self-collected datasets validate that the proposed
method achieves calibration accuracy comparable to target-based methods, while
exhibiting superior stability over purely CCA-based methods, and highlighting
its precision, robustness and flexibility. To facilitate future research, our
implementation will be made open-source. Code:

Conclusion: 该框架为软连续体机器人提供了一种高效、准确且实时的动态控制方案，DD-PINN作为代理模型显著提升了计算效率

Abstract: Dynamic control of soft continuum robots (SCRs) holds great potential for
expanding their applications, but remains a challenging problem due to the high
computational demands of accurate dynamic models. While data-driven approaches
like Koopman-operator-based methods have been proposed, they typically lack
adaptability and cannot capture the full robot shape, limiting their
applicability. This work introduces a real-time-capable nonlinear
model-predictive control (MPC) framework for SCRs based on a domain-decoupled
physics-informed neural network (DD-PINN) with adaptable bending stiffness. The
DD-PINN serves as a surrogate for the dynamic Cosserat rod model with a
speed-up factor of 44000. It is also used within an unscented Kalman filter for
estimating the model states and bending compliance from end-effector position
measurements. We implement a nonlinear evolutionary MPC running at 70 Hz on the
GPU. In simulation, it demonstrates accurate tracking of dynamic trajectories
and setpoint control with end-effector position errors below 3 mm (2.3% of the
actuator's length). In real-world experiments, the controller achieves similar
accuracy and accelerations up to 3.55 m/s2.

Abstract: In autonomous racing, reactive controllers eliminate the computational burden
of the full See-Think-Act autonomy stack by directly mapping sensor inputs to
control actions. This bypasses the need for explicit localization and
trajectory planning. A widely adopted baseline in this category is the
Follow-The-Gap method, which performs trajectory planning using LiDAR data.
Building on FTG, the Delaunay Triangulation-based Racing algorithm introduces
further enhancements. However, DTR's use of circumcircles for trajectory
generation often results in insufficiently smooth paths, ultimately degrading
performance. Additionally, the commonly used F1TENTH-simulator for autonomous
racing competitions lacks support for 3D LiDAR perception, limiting its
effectiveness in realistic testing. To address these challenges, this work
proposes the MCTR algorithm. MCTR improves trajectory smoothness through the
use of Curvature Corrected Moving Average and implements a digital twin system
within the CARLA simulator to validate the algorithm's robustness under 3D
LiDAR perception. The proposed algorithm has been thoroughly validated through
both simulation and real-world vehicle experiments.

TL;DR: RoboRetriever是一个仅使用单个腕戴式RGB-D相机和自然语言指令的机器人物体检索框架，通过动态层次场景图和主动感知实现复杂环境中的物体检索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够轻松在杂乱、部分可观测环境中检索物体，而现有机器人系统依赖多摄像头设置，硬件成本高且适应性差，需要开发更灵活的单摄像头解决方案

Method: 构建动态层次场景图编码物体语义、几何和关系；使用监督模块推理任务指令；集成主动感知、交互感知和操作；引入视觉提示方案利用大语言模型确定6自由度相机位姿

Result: 在多样化真实世界物体检索任务中表现出色，包括有人干预的场景，在杂乱环境中仅使用单个RGB-D相机就展现出强大的适应性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: RoboRetriever证明了仅使用单个腕戴相机即可实现复杂环境中的物体检索，为机器人感知和操作提供了更灵活、低成本的解决方案

Abstract: Humans effortlessly retrieve objects in cluttered, partially observable
environments by combining visual reasoning, active viewpoint adjustment, and
physical interaction-with only a single pair of eyes. In contrast, most
existing robotic systems rely on carefully positioned fixed or multi-camera
setups with complete scene visibility, which limits adaptability and incurs
high hardware costs. We present \textbf{RoboRetriever}, a novel framework for
real-world object retrieval that operates using only a \textbf{single}
wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and free-form natural language instructions.
RoboRetriever grounds visual observations to build and update a \textbf{dynamic
hierarchical scene graph} that encodes object semantics, geometry, and
inter-object relations over time. The supervisor module reasons over this
memory and task instruction to infer the target object and coordinate an
integrated action module combining \textbf{active perception},
\textbf{interactive perception}, and \textbf{manipulation}. To enable
task-aware scene-grounded active perception, we introduce a novel visual
prompting scheme that leverages large reasoning vision-language models to
determine 6-DoF camera poses aligned with the semantic task goal and geometry
scene context. We evaluate RoboRetriever on diverse real-world object retrieval
tasks, including scenarios with human intervention, demonstrating strong
adaptability and robustness in cluttered scenes with only one RGB-D camera.

TL;DR: 使用光流技术在高延迟微伪真实机器人中创造自我运动幻觉，但在500ms延迟下未显著提升性能，反而可能增加VR舔送症

Motivation: 解决使用360度摄像头微伪真实机器人的高延迟问题，帮助用户在延迟期间更好地控制系统

Method: 利用光流技术在用户发送运动命令到看到实际运动的延迟期间创造自我运动幻觉

Result: 在500ms延迟下，该方法对任务完成时间和碰撞物体的性能没有显著改善，反而可能增加了VR舔送症

Conclusion: 需要进一步调整和改进才能使该方法变得可行

Abstract: Mobile telepresence robots allow users to feel present and explore remote
environments using technology. Traditionally, these systems are implemented
using a camera onboard a mobile robot that can be controlled. Although
high-immersion technologies, such as 360-degree cameras, can increase
situational awareness and presence, they also introduce significant challenges.
Additional processing and bandwidth requirements often result in latencies of
up to seconds. The current delay with a 360-degree camera streaming over the
internet makes real-time control of these systems difficult. Working with
high-latency systems requires some form of assistance to the users.
  This study presents a novel way to utilize optical flow to create an illusion
of self-motion to the user during the latency period between user sending
motion commands to the robot and seeing the actual motion through the
360-camera stream. We find no significant benefit of using the self-motion
illusion to performance or accuracy of controlling a telepresence robot with a
latency of 500 ms, as measured by the task completion time and collisions into
objects. Some evidence is shown that the method might increase virtual reality
(VR) sickness, as measured by the simulator sickness questionnaire (SSQ). We
conclude that further adjustments are necessary in order to render the method
viable.

Abstract: Legged robots have the potential to traverse highly constrained environments
with agile maneuvers. However, planning such motions requires solving a highly
challenging optimization problem with a mixture of continuous and discrete
decision variables. In this paper, we present a full pipeline based on
Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and whole-body trajectory optimization (TO) to
perform simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection on highly challenging
environments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that our
framework can quickly find a diverse set of dynamically consistent plans. We
experimentally show that these plans are transferable to a real quadruped
robot. We further show that the same framework can find highly complex acyclic
humanoid maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration of simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection for acyclic
multi-contact locomotion using the whole-body dynamics of a quadruped.

Conclusion: 该框架通过连续表征和优化方法，有效解决了全身操纵规划中的连续接触问题，为人形机器人自主操作提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Daily tasks require us to use our whole body to manipulate objects, for
instance when our hands are unavailable. We consider the issue of providing
humanoid robots with the ability to autonomously perform similar whole-body
manipulation tasks. In this context, the infinite possibilities for where and
how contact can occur on the robot and object surfaces hinder the scalability
of existing planning methods, which predominantly rely on discrete sampling.
Given the continuous nature of contact surfaces, gradient-based optimization
offers a more suitable approach for finding solutions. However, a key remaining
challenge is the lack of an efficient representation of robot surfaces. In this
work, we propose (i) a representation of robot and object surfaces that enables
closed-form computation of proximity points, and (ii) a cost design that
effectively guides whole-body manipulation planning. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed framework can solve problems unaddressed by
existing methods, and achieves a 77% improvement in planning time over the
state of the art. We also validate the suitability of our approach on real
hardware through the whole-body manipulation of boxes by a humanoid robot.

Motivation: 传统运动规划方法在处理速度、加速度等动力学约束时存在困难，需要一种能够高效处理高维目标函数和严格安全约束的规划算法。

Method: 采用约束贝叶斯优化(CBO)方法，专注于可达速度的规划窗口，通过高效采样控制输入来管理动力学约束和安全约束。

Conclusion: BOW Planner在实际机器人系统中成功部署，展现出卓越的采样效率、安全感知优化和快速规划能力，已作为开源包发布。

Abstract: This paper introduces the BOW Planner, a scalable motion planning algorithm
designed to navigate robots through complex environments using constrained
Bayesian optimization (CBO). Unlike traditional methods, which often struggle
with kinodynamic constraints such as velocity and acceleration limits, the BOW
Planner excels by concentrating on a planning window of reachable velocities
and employing CBO to sample control inputs efficiently. This approach enables
the planner to manage high-dimensional objective functions and stringent safety
constraints with minimal sampling, ensuring rapid and secure trajectory
generation. Theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's asymptotic
convergence to near-optimal solutions, while extensive evaluations in cluttered
and constrained settings reveal substantial improvements in computation times,
trajectory lengths, and solution times compared to existing techniques.
Successfully deployed across various real-world robotic systems, the BOW
Planner demonstrates its practical significance through exceptional sample
efficiency, safety-aware optimization, and rapid planning capabilities, making
it a valuable tool for advancing robotic applications. The BOW Planner is
released as an open-source package and videos of real-world and simulated
experiments are available at https://bow-web.github.io.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OC-VLA框架通过将动作预测直接建立在相机观测空间中，解决了VLA模型在不同相机视角下空间不一致的问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在泛化到真实世界环境时面临挑战，主要由于观测空间和动作空间之间的差异。虽然训练数据来自不同相机视角，但模型通常在机器人基座坐标系中预测末端执行器位姿，导致空间不一致。

Method: 引入OC-VLA框架，利用相机外参标定矩阵将末端执行器位姿从机器人基座坐标系转换到相机坐标系，统一不同视角下的预测目标。这是一个轻量级、即插即用的策略。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界机器人操作任务上的综合评估表明，OC-VLA加速了收敛速度，提高了任务成功率，并改善了跨视角泛化能力。

Conclusion: OC-VLA框架通过统一观测和动作空间，有效解决了VLA模型的空间不一致问题，提高了模型对相机视角变化的鲁棒性，且与现有VLA架构兼容。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models frequently encounter challenges in
generalizing to real-world environments due to inherent discrepancies between
observation and action spaces. Although training data are collected from
diverse camera perspectives, the models typically predict end-effector poses
within the robot base coordinate frame, resulting in spatial inconsistencies.
To mitigate this limitation, we introduce the Observation-Centric VLA (OC-VLA)
framework, which grounds action predictions directly in the camera observation
space. Leveraging the camera's extrinsic calibration matrix, OC-VLA transforms
end-effector poses from the robot base coordinate system into the camera
coordinate system, thereby unifying prediction targets across heterogeneous
viewpoints. This lightweight, plug-and-play strategy ensures robust alignment
between perception and action, substantially improving model resilience to
camera viewpoint variations. The proposed approach is readily compatible with
existing VLA architectures, requiring no substantial modifications.
Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks demonstrate that OC-VLA accelerates convergence, enhances task success
rates, and improves cross-view generalization. The code will be publicly
available.

Method: 采用强化学习方法，结合操作性先验知识使机器人关注高操作性位置，使用供价地图选择高质量操作动作，减少不必要的探索

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合操作性先验和供价地图，有效解决了动态环境中的操作到导航问题，提高了机器人主动交互能力

Abstract: Mobile manipulation in dynamic environments is challenging due to movable
obstacles blocking the robot's path. Traditional methods, which treat
navigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such
'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before
navigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required
to clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the
manipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based
approach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent
navigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on
high manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting
high-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful
actions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to
learn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new
manipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston
Dynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good
hand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively
forward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires
the robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of
these tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward.
Results show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and
traverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a
real Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task.

Motivation: 理解歌曲在Spotify榜单中上升的因素可以指导营销投资和艺术创作，特别是在早期阶段

Method: 使用2024年美国Top 200日榜数据和Spotify API，构建14,639首歌曲的数据集。采用逻辑回归、K近邻、随机森林和XGBoost四种模型，进行跨验证和超参数调整

Result: 树基模型表现最佳，随机森林和XGBoost的宏F1分数接近0.95，准确率达97%。即使不包含流量数据，仅靠音频属性也有预测能力

Conclusion: 音频特征本身具有重要预测价值，可用于A&R挖掘、歌单优化和爆歌预测，在歌曲达到关键流量前就能做出预测

Abstract: Spotify's streaming charts offer a real-time lens into music popularity,
driving discovery, playlists, and even revenue potential. Understanding what
influences a song's rise in ranks on these charts-especially early on-can guide
marketing efforts, investment decisions, and even artistic direction. In this
project, we developed a classification pipeline to predict a song's chart
success based on its musical characteristics and early engagement data. Using
all 2024 U.S. Top 200 Spotify Daily Charts and the Spotify Web API, we built a
dataset containing both metadata and audio features for 14,639 unique songs.
  The project was structured in two phases. First, we benchmarked four models:
Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost-using a
standard train-test split. In the second phase, we incorporated
cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and detailed class-level evaluation to
ensure robustness. Tree-based models consistently outperformed the rest, with
Random Forest and XGBoost achieving macro F1-scores near 0.95 and accuracy
around 97%.
  Even when stream count and rank history were excluded, models trained solely
on audio attributes retained predictive power. These findings validate the
potential of audio-based modeling in A&R scouting, playlist optimization, and
hit forecasting-long before a track reaches critical mass.

data into explicit reasoning chains, yielding AF-CoT-Train with 1.24M samples.
We study the effect of finetuning Audio Flamingo series on AF-CoT-Train and
observe considerable improvements on several reasoning benchmarks, validating

understanding.

Abstract: Bioacoustics, the study of sounds produced by living organisms, plays a vital
role in conservation, biodiversity monitoring, and behavioral studies. Many
tasks in this field, such as species, individual, and behavior classification
and detection, are well-suited to machine learning. However, they often suffer
from limited annotated data, highlighting the need for a general-purpose
bioacoustic encoder capable of extracting useful representations for diverse
downstream tasks. Such encoders have been proposed before, but are often
limited in scope due to a focus on a narrow range of species (typically birds),
and a reliance on a single model architecture or training paradigm. Moreover,
they are usually evaluated on a small set of tasks and datasets. In this work,
we present a large-scale empirical study that covers aspects of bioacoustics
that are relevant to research but have previously been scarcely considered:
training data diversity and scale, model architectures and training recipes,
and the breadth of evaluation tasks and datasets. We obtain encoders that are
state-of-the-art on the existing and proposed benchmarks. We also identify what
matters for training these encoders, such that this work can be extended when
more data are available or better architectures are proposed. Specifically,
across 26 datasets with tasks including species classification, detection,
individual ID, and vocal repertoire discovery, we find self-supervised
pre-training followed by supervised post-training on a mixed bioacoustics +
general-audio corpus yields the strongest in- and out-of-distribution
performance. We show the importance of data diversity in both stages. To
support ongoing research and application, we will release the model
checkpoints.

Conclusion: 该研究为音频编辑领域提供了重要的评估工具和数据资源，AuditScore和AuditEval有力地解决了评估指标缺乏和主观评估成本高的挑战，为未来音频编辑技术的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Audio editing aims to manipulate audio content based on textual descriptions,
supporting tasks such as adding, removing, or replacing audio events. Despite
recent progress, the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and comprehensive
evaluation metrics remains a major challenge for both assessing audio editing
quality and improving the task itself. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for audio editing task by incorporating expert knowledge into both the
evaluation and dataset construction processes: 1) First, we establish
AuditScore, the first comprehensive dataset for subjective evaluation of audio
editing, consisting of over 6,300 edited samples generated from 7
representative audio editing frameworks and 23 system configurations. Each
sample is annotated by professional raters on three key aspects of audio
editing quality: overall Quality, Relevance to editing intent, and Faithfulness
to original features. 2) Based on this dataset, we train AuditEval, the first
model designed for automatic MOS-style scoring tailored to audio editing tasks.
AuditEval addresses the critical lack of objective evaluation metrics and the
prohibitive cost of subjective assessment in this field. 3) We further leverage
AuditEval to evaluate and filter a large amount of synthetically mixed editing
pairs, constructing a high-quality pseudo-parallel dataset by selecting the
most plausible samples. Objective experiments validate the effectiveness of our
expert-informed filtering strategy in yielding higher-quality data, while also
revealing the limitations of relying solely on objective metrics. The dataset,
codes and tools can be found at: https://github.com/NKU-HLT/AuditEval.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of Hindi speech separation and
enhancement using advanced neural network architectures, with a focus on edge
devices. We propose a refined approach leveraging the DEMUCS model to overcome
limitations of traditional methods, achieving substantial improvements in
speech clarity and intelligibility. The model is fine-tuned with U-Net and LSTM

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于自监督预训练模型的机器异常声音检测方法，通过LoRA微调、机器感知组适配器和动态聚类对比学习损失来提升模型泛化性能，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器异常声音检测(ASD)在实际应用中面临数据收集困难和声学环境复杂等挑战，导致泛化性能受限。受大型预训练模型在其他领域成功的启发，希望利用音频预训练模型来提升ASD性能。

Method: 1) 使用在大规模语音和音频数据集上预训练的自监督模型；2) 采用完全连接的低秩适应(LoRA)替代全微调以减少过拟合；3) 提出机器感知组适配器模块来捕获不同机器间的差异；4) 设计基于向量量化和双级对比学习损失的新目标函数来处理无属性标签数据。

Result: 在DCASE 2020-2024所有五个ASD挑战基准数据集上的实验结果表明，新方法取得了显著改进，证明了所提出策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型即使与ASD任务存在不一致性，仍能为ASD带来实质性好处。提出的LoRA微调、机器感知适配器和动态聚类对比学习方法有效提升了ASD系统的泛化性能。

Abstract: Machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) is a valuable technique across
various applications. However, its generalization performance is often limited
due to challenges in data collection and the complexity of acoustic
environments. Inspired by the success of large pre-trained models in numerous
fields, this paper introduces a robust ASD model that leverages self-supervised
pre-trained models trained on large-scale speech and audio datasets. Although
there are inconsistencies between the pre-training datasets and the ASD task,
our findings indicate that pre-training still provides substantial benefits for
ASD. To mitigate overfitting and retain learned knowledge when fine-tuning with
limited data, we explore Fully-Connected Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an
alternative to full fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a Machine-aware Group
Adapter module, which enables the model to capture differences between various
machines within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the generalization
performance of ASD systems. To address the challenge of missing attribute
labels, we design a novel objective function that dynamically clusters
unattributed data using vector quantization and optimizes through a dual-level
contrastive learning loss. The proposed methods are evaluated on all benchmark
datasets, including the DCASE 2020-2024 five ASD challenges, and the
experimental results show significant improvements of our new approach and
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.

Conclusion: VICReg正则化目标能有效提升语音基础模型在噪声环境下的泛化能力，为噪声鲁棒性提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Noise robustness in speech foundation models (SFMs) has been a critical
challenge, as most models are primarily trained on clean data and experience
performance degradation when the models are exposed to noisy speech. To address
this issue, we propose HuBERT-VIC, a noise-robust SFM with variance,
in-variance, and covariance regularization (VICReg) objectives. These
objectives adjust the statistics of noisy speech representations, enabling the
model to capture diverse acoustic characteristics and improving the
generalization ability across different types of noise. When applied to HuBERT,
our model shows relative performance improvements of 23.3% on LibriSpeech
test-clean and 13.2% on test-other, compared to the baseline model pre-trained
on noisy speech.

Method: 使用音频单模态SELD模型作为老师，通过输出响应和中间特征表征向音视频学生模型进行知识传递。采用多层次数据增帽技术，随机混合多个网络层的特征，并为SELD任务采用专门设计的损失函数。

Result: 在DCASE 2023和2024 SELD数据集上的实验显示，方法在整体指标上相比基准线获得22%~36%的相对提升。方法达到了与在更大数据集训练的老师模型相当或更好的效果，在两个DCASE SELD任务上都超越了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态知识萌荘结合多层次数据增帽是一种有效的方法，能够在低资源音视频SELD任务中实现显著的性能提升，甚至可以达到与在更大数据集上训练的模型相当的效果。

Abstract: This work presents a cross-modal knowledge distillation (CMKD) framework
combined with multi-level data augmentation for low-resource audio-visual (AV)
sound event localization and detection (SELD). An audio-only SELD model acts as
the teacher, transferring knowledge to an AV student model through both output
responses and intermediate feature representations. To enhance learning, data
augmentation is applied by mixing features randomly selected from multiple
network layers and associated loss functions tailored to the SELD task.
Extensive experiments on the DCASE 2023 and 2024 SELD datasets show that the
proposed method significantly improves AV SELD performance, yielding relative
gains of 22%~36% in the overall metric over the baseline. Notably, our approach
achieves results comparable to or better than teacher models trained on much
larger datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on both DCASE 2023 and

Motivation: 解决手工音乐情感标注的资源和劳动力成本高问题，探索大语言模型作为可扩展的自动化标注方案

Method: 使用GPT-4o对GiantMIDI-Piano经典MIDI钢琴音乐数据集进行四象限情绪激活度框架标注，与三位人类专家标注进行对比

Result: GPT标注的整体精确度略差于人类专家，在具体情感状态分类上缺乏细腻性，但其标注变异性在专家之间的自然异议范围内

Conclusion: 虽然GPT在标注性能上仍有不足，但其成本效益和效率优势使其成为音乐情感标注的有前景可扩展替代方案

Abstract: Current approaches to music emotion annotation remain heavily reliant on
manual labelling, a process that imposes significant resource and labour
burdens, severely limiting the scale of available annotated data. This study
examines the feasibility and reliability of employing a large language model
(GPT-4o) for music emotion annotation. In this study, we annotated
GiantMIDI-Piano, a classical MIDI piano music dataset, in a four-quadrant
valence-arousal framework using GPT-4o, and compared against annotations
provided by three human experts. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess
the performance and reliability of GPT-generated music emotion annotations,
including standard accuracy, weighted accuracy that accounts for inter-expert
agreement, inter-annotator agreement metrics, and distributional similarity of
the generated labels.
  While GPT's annotation performance fell short of human experts in overall
accuracy and exhibited less nuance in categorizing specific emotional states,
inter-rater reliability metrics indicate that GPT's variability remains within
the range of natural disagreement among experts. These findings underscore both
the limitations and potential of GPT-based annotation: despite its current
shortcomings relative to human performance, its cost-effectiveness and
efficiency render it a promising scalable alternative for music emotion
annotation.

<details>

Motivation: 当前掩码预测方法中的预测器模块没有充分考虑音频内容的本质模糊性，特别是多声源情况下的预测不确定性。

Method: 在MATPAC系统中集成多重选择学习(MCL)，显式建模预测模糊性，改善预测和无监督分类预文任务。

Result: 在AudioSet上细调后达到状态前沿性能，在多丫下游任务上获得总体最佳成绩，在音乐数据上训练时显著提高效率并达到状态前沿。

Conclusion: 通过MCL显式模型预测模糊性能够显著提升自监督学习的表征质量，尤其在复杂音频场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Masked latent prediction has emerged as a leading paradigm in self-supervised
learning (SSL), especially for general audio and music representation learning.
While recent methods have demonstrated strong performance, the role of the
predictor module used at the output of such SSL systems remains mainly
overlooked, despite being crucial for solving the pretext task at hand. In
particular, this module should be able to deal with the ambiguity inherent in
audio content, especially when it is composed of multiple sound sources. This
work proposes a novel enhancement: integrating Multiple Choice Learning (MCL)
to explicitly model prediction ambiguity and improve representation quality. We
build on top of the recently proposed MATPAC system, improving its prediction
and unsupervised classification pretext tasks with MCL. We extensively evaluate
our method, MATPAC++, through both linear probing across multiple downstream
tasks and fine-tuning on AudioSet, employing a unified protocol that enables
rigorous and fair comparisons with state-of-the-art SSL approaches. Results
show that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art when fine-tuned on AudioSet
and overall state-of-the-art scores on downstream tasks. Additionally, we
examine domain specialisation by training exclusively on music data, where our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly improved
efficiency.

Motivation: 现有视频到音频技术大多专注于单声道音频生成，缺乏空间感知能力，而能够提供更强沉浸感的双耳空间音频生成技术研究不足。

Method: 提出声音源估计方法确定每帧视频中的声源2D坐标和深度，通过坐标映射机制转换为3D轨迹，结合预训练V2A模型生成的单声道音频，作为扩散模型的条件输入来生成空间一致的双耳音频。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在空间感知一致性方面优于现有方法，有效提升了音视频体验的沉浸质量。

Conclusion: FoleySpace框架成功实现了视频到双耳音频的生成，为沉浸式音视频体验提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, with the advancement of AIGC, deep learning-based video-to-audio
(V2A) technology has garnered significant attention. However, existing research
mostly focuses on mono audio generation that lacks spatial perception, while
the exploration of binaural spatial audio generation technologies, which can
provide a stronger sense of immersion, remains insufficient. To solve this
problem, we propose FoleySpace, a framework for video-to-binaural audio
generation that produces immersive and spatially consistent stereo sound guided
by visual information. Specifically, we develop a sound source estimation
method to determine the sound source 2D coordinates and depth in each video
frame, and then employ a coordinate mapping mechanism to convert the 2D source
positions into a 3D trajectory. This 3D trajectory, together with the monaural
audio generated by a pre-trained V2A model, serves as a conditioning input for
a diffusion model to generate spatially consistent binaural audio. To support
the generation of dynamic sound fields, we constructed a training dataset based
on recorded Head-Related Impulse Responses that includes various sound source
movement scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms existing approaches in spatial perception consistency, effectively
enhancing the immersive quality of the audio-visual experience.

Abstract: Improved computational power has enabled different disciplines to predict
causal relationships among modeled variables using Bayesian network inference.
While many alternative algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency
and reliability of network prediction, the predicted causal networks reflect
the generative process but also bear an opaque imprint of the specific
computational algorithm used. Following a ``wisdom of the crowds" strategy, we
developed an ensemble learning approach to marginalize the impact of a single
algorithm on Bayesian causal network inference. To introduce the approach, we
first present the theoretical foundation of this framework. Next, we present a
comprehensive implementation of the framework in terms of a new software tool
called BaMANI (Bayesian Multi-Algorithm causal Network Inference). Finally, we
describe a BaMANI use-case from biology, particularly within human breast
cancer studies.

Method: 设计了计算高效且易于采用的方法，通过系统性地删除数据来测试Bradley-Terry排名系统的稳健性

Result: 发现顶级模型的排名对删除很小部分评估数据极其敏感，MT-Bench比Chatbot Arena更稳健，人工评估和LLM评估都存在类似敏感性

Conclusion: 当前的LLM排名系统存在显著的稳健性问题，需要更加谨慎地评估模型性能，并考虑使用专家注释和精心设计的提示来提高排名结果的可靠性

Abstract: We propose a method for evaluating the robustness of a widely used LLM
ranking system -- the Bradley--Terry ranking system -- to dropping a worst-case
very small fraction of evaluation data. Our approach is computationally fast
and easy to adopt. When we apply our method to matchups from two popular
human-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the
Bradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to
the removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies
the specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for
inspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings
derived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from
Chatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully
constructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced
human-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge
evaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total
evaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.

Abstract: Data fusion and transfer learning are rapidly growing fields that enhance
model performance for a target population by leveraging other related data
sources or tasks. The challenges lie in the various potential heterogeneities
between the target and external data, as well as various practical concerns
that prevent a na\"ive data integration. We consider a realistic scenario where
the target data is limited in size while the external data is large but
contaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other
computational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or
subsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our
knowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not
been thoroughly investigated. We address this gap by studying various transfer
learning methods with subsamples of the external data, accounting for outliers
deviating from the underlying true model due to arbitrary mean shifts. Two
subsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the
other at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also
introduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide
non-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying
the roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of
outliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors.
Extensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods.
Additionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380
airplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust
transfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare
airplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.

Abstract: Sliced Optimal Transport (SOT) is a rapidly developing branch of optimal
transport (OT) that exploits the tractability of one-dimensional OT problems.
By combining tools from OT, integral geometry, and computational statistics,
SOT enables fast and scalable computation of distances, barycenters, and
kernels for probability measures, while retaining rich geometric structure.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of SOT, covering its mathematical
foundations, methodological advances, computational methods, and applications.
We discuss key concepts of OT and one-dimensional OT, the role of tools from
integral geometry such as Radon transform in projecting measures, and
statistical techniques for estimating sliced distances. The paper further
explores recent methodological advances, including non-linear projections,
improved Monte Carlo approximations, statistical estimation techniques for
one-dimensional optimal transport, weighted slicing techniques, and
transportation plan estimation methods. Variational problems, such as minimum
sliced Wasserstein estimation, barycenters, gradient flows, kernel
constructions, and embeddings are examined alongside extensions to unbalanced,
partial, multi-marginal, and Gromov-Wasserstein settings. Applications span
machine learning, statistics, computer graphics and computer visions,
highlighting SOT's versatility as a practical computational tool. This work
will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data
sciences, and computational disciplines seeking efficient alternatives to
classical OT.

Abstract: Dynamic relational structures play a central role in many AI tasks, but their
evolving nature presents challenges for consistent and interpretable
representation. A common approach is to learn time-varying node embeddings,
whose effectiveness depends on satisfying key stability properties. In this
paper, we propose Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding, a new method that
extends the Unfolded Adjacency Spectral Embedding framework to normalized
Laplacians while preserving both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability. We
provide formal proof that our method satisfies these stability conditions. In
addition, as a bonus of using the Laplacian matrix, we establish a new
Cheeger-style inequality that connects the embeddings to the conductance of the
underlying dynamic graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world
datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the strong
performance of our method. These results establish a principled and stable
framework for dynamic network representation grounded in spectral graph theory.

Conclusion: 本文提供了一种基于理论分析的数学化初始化方差选择方法，为深度神经网络的参数初始化提供了严格的数学基础，同时也清楚地解释了参数动力学过程的物理含义

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), one of the most fundamental optimization
algorithms in machine learning (ML), can be recast through a continuous-time
approximation as a Fokker-Planck equation for Langevin dynamics, a viewpoint
that has motivated many theoretical studies. Within this framework, we study
the relationship between the quasi-stationary distribution derived from this
equation and the initial distribution through the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence. As the quasi-steady-state distribution depends on the expected cost
function, the KL divergence eventually reveals the connection between the
expected cost function and the initialization distribution. By applying this to
deep neural network models (DNNs), we can express the bounds of the expected
loss function explicitly in terms of the initialization parameters. Then, by
minimizing this bound, we obtain an optimal condition of the initialization
variance in the Gaussian case. This result provides a concrete mathematical
criterion, rather than a heuristic approach, to select the scale of weight
initialization in DNNs. In addition, we experimentally confirm our theoretical
results by using the classical SGD to train fully connected neural networks on
the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. The result shows that if the variance of
the initialization distribution satisfies our theoretical optimal condition,
then the corresponding DNN model always achieves lower final training loss and
higher test accuracy than the conventional He-normal initialization. Our work
thus supplies a mathematically grounded indicator that guides the choice of
initialization variance and clarifies its physical meaning of the dynamics of
parameters in DNNs.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for predicting next actions in soccer
possessions by leveraging path signatures to encode their complex
spatio-temporal structure. Unlike existing approaches, we do not rely on fixed
historical windows and handcrafted features, but rather encode the entire
recent possession, thereby avoiding the inclusion of potentially irrelevant or
misleading historical information. Path signatures naturally capture the order
and interaction of events, providing a mathematically grounded feature encoding
for variable-length time series of irregular sampling frequencies without the
necessity for manual feature engineering. Our proposed approach outperforms a
transformer-based benchmark across various loss metrics and considerably
reduces computational cost. Building on these results, we introduce a new
possession evaluation metric based on well-established frameworks in soccer
analytics, incorporating both predicted action type probabilities and action
location. Our metric shows greater reliability than existing metrics in
domain-specific comparisons. Finally, we validate our approach through a
detailed analysis of the 2017/18 Premier League season and discuss further
applications and future extensions.

this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as
particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to
train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring
access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The
neural network can rapidly perform Bayesian inference on empirical observations
without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we
provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We
outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic
tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and
prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and
validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from
astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers
researchers to apply state-of-the-art SBI methods, facilitating efficient
parameter inference for scientific discovery.

*Michael Mayer,Mario V. Wüthrich*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了Shapley值在机器学习预测解释中的重要性，研究了两种采样近似方法的统计特性，并提出了新的理论发现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Shapley值已成为机器学习预测解释的流行工具，但计算复杂度是主要限制。采样近似方法虽然常用，但其统计特性和性能尚未得到充分研究

Method: 采用理论分析方法，研究了样本KernelSHAP和样本PermutationSHAP两种采样近似方法的齐次性质性质，并分析了对应采样方法在不同交互作用条件下的性能

Result: 证明了两种采样近似方法都具有齐次正态性，并发现在最大二阶交互作用时，配对采样方法能够提供精确结果，同时发现PermutationSHAP具有加性恢复性质而KernelSHAP则没有

Conclusion: 该研究为Shapley值采样近似方法提供了重要的理论基础，明确了不同采样方法的统计特性和适用条件，对于选择适合的Shapley值计算方法具有重要指导意义

Abstract: Originally introduced in cooperative game theory, Shapley values have become
a very popular tool to explain machine learning predictions. Based on Shapley's
fairness axioms, every input (feature component) gets a credit how it
contributes to an output (prediction). These credits are then used to explain
the prediction. The only limitation in computing the Shapley values (credits)
for many different predictions is of computational nature. There are two
popular sampling approximations, sampling KernelSHAP and sampling
PermutationSHAP. Our first novel contributions are asymptotic normality results
for these sampling approximations. Next, we show that the paired-sampling
approaches provide exact results in case of interactions being of maximal order
two. Furthermore, the paired-sampling PermutationSHAP possesses the additive
recovery property, whereas its kernel counterpart does not.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中常见预测问题，分割图像通过边缘提供了重要的诊断信息，需要开发能够利用图像中对象形状的新方法来进行监督分类。

Method: 提出多元平面曲线的新形式化方法，解决统计形状分析中的对齐问题，并通过切空间投影将获得的多元形状变量用于功能分类方法。

Result: 在分割X光图像中进行心脏扩大症检测，以及在合成数据上进行的数值实验都证明了该方法的吸引力和稳健性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多元平面曲线分析框架以及基于形状变量的分类方法，为医学图像分析预测问题提供了有效的解决方案，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Recent developments in computer vision have enabled the availability of
segmented images across various domains, such as medicine, where segmented
radiography images play an important role in diagnosis-making. As prediction
problems are common in medical image analysis, this work explores the use of
segmented images (through the associated contours they highlight) as predictors
in a supervised classification context. Consequently, we develop a new approach
for image analysis that takes into account the shape of objects within images.
For this aim, we introduce a new formalism that extends the study of single
random planar curves to the joint analysis of multiple planar curves-referred
to here as multivariate planar curves. In this framework, we propose a solution
to the alignment issue in statistical shape analysis. The obtained multivariate
shape variables are then used in functional classification methods through
tangent projections. Detection of cardiomegaly in segmented X-rays and
numerical experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the appeal and robustness
of the proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的通用性遗传随机场（GGRF）方法，用于高维度序列数据的关联分析，在缓解稀有变异作用时显示出更好的检出力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速序列技术的发展使得研究全部序列变异对复杂人类疾病的影响成为可能，但高维度序列数据的统计分析仍面临挑战，需要先进的分析方法

Method: 构建在通用估计方程（GEE）框架上的GGRF方法，类似于SIMreg和SKAT等相似性基础方法，避免了对缓解稀有变异阈值的需求，允许测试不同方向和效应大小的多重变异

Result: 通过模拟实验验证，GGRF在各种疾病场景下都实现了更高或相似的检出力，尤其是当缓解稀有变异在疾病发生中起重要作用时；在Dallas心血管研究的真实数据中成功检测到ANGPTL3和ANGPTL4基因与血清三酮油酸甜油酯的关联

Conclusion: GGRF方法为高维度序列数据的关联分析提供了一种有效的统计工具，具有良好的近似性质和应用灵活性，在缓解稀有变异分析方面表现优异

Abstract: With the advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has become
feasible to investigate the influence of the entire spectrum of sequencing
variations on complex human diseases. Although association studies utilizing
the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic
variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases,
the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a
challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate
high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a
generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of
sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT),
the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds
for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in
different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the
generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of
disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has
a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data
without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate
that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly
used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare
variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate
GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By
using GGRF, we were able to detect the association of two candidate genes,
ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4, with serum triglyceride.

TL;DR: iTrace是一个在Apple Vision Pro上通过点击交互提取用户注视数据的系统，使用手动和自动方法生成动态热力图，实现了91%的注视精度，可用于教育、设计、营销和临床评估等多个领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Apple Vision Pro具有精确的眼动追踪能力，但隐私限制阻止直接访问连续用户注视数据。研究旨在克服这一限制，开发能够提取和分析用户注视模式的系统。

Method: 开发了iTrace应用程序，采用客户端-服务器架构，通过点击式注视提取技术（包括手动捏合手势、自动停留控制和游戏控制器）捕获注视坐标，并转换为动态热力图进行视频和空间眼动追踪。

Result: 8BitDo控制器实现了14.22次点击/秒的数据收集率，显著高于停留控制的0.45次点击/秒，能够生成更密集的热力图可视化。系统达到91%的注视精度，热力图揭示了不同的注意力模式。

Conclusion: iTrace在保持高精度的同时实现了动态注意力可视化，在教育内容参与、环境设计评估、营销分析和临床认知评估等领域具有广泛应用潜力，但建议仅在研究环境中使用。

Abstract: The Apple Vision Pro is equipped with accurate eye-tracking capabilities, yet
the privacy restrictions on the device prevent direct access to continuous user
gaze data. This study introduces iTrace, a novel application that overcomes
these limitations through click-based gaze extraction techniques, including
manual methods like a pinch gesture, and automatic approaches utilizing dwell
control or a gaming controller. We developed a system with a client-server
architecture that captures the gaze coordinates and transforms them into
dynamic heatmaps for video and spatial eye tracking. The system can generate
individual and averaged heatmaps, enabling analysis of personal and collective
attention patterns.
  To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate the usability and performance,
a study was conducted with two groups of 10 participants, each testing
different clicking methods. The 8BitDo controller achieved higher average data
collection rates at 14.22 clicks/s compared to 0.45 clicks/s with dwell
control, enabling significantly denser heatmap visualizations. The resulting
heatmaps reveal distinct attention patterns, including concentrated focus in
lecture videos and broader scanning during problem-solving tasks. By allowing
dynamic attention visualization while maintaining a high gaze precision of 91
%, iTrace demonstrates strong potential for a wide range of applications in
educational content engagement, environmental design evaluation, marketing
analysis, and clinical cognitive assessment. Despite the current gaze data
restrictions on the Apple Vision Pro, we encourage developers to use iTrace
only in research settings.

Abstract: We introduce fCrit, a dialogue-based AI system designed to critique furniture
design with a focus on explainability. Grounded in reflective learning and
formal analysis, fCrit employs a multi-agent architecture informed by a
structured design knowledge base. We argue that explainability in the arts
should not only make AI reasoning transparent but also adapt to the ways users
think and talk about their designs. We demonstrate how fCrit supports this
process by tailoring explanations to users' design language and cognitive
framing. This work contributes to Human-Centered Explainable AI (HCXAI) in
creative practice, advancing domain-specific methods for situated, dialogic,

Motivation: 调查当前研究中使用大语言模型生成用户人设的提示词实践状况和存在的问题

Method: 对83个来自27篇研究论文的人设提示词进行内容分析，包括格式、内容类型、数量、结构等多维度分析

Result: 提示词主要生成单一人设，提倡简短描述，以文本和数字格式为主，人口统计属性普遍包含，74%插入动态变量，过半数要求结构化输出

Conclusion: 计算机人设的增加使用对用户表征产生重要影响，当前方法存在过于简化、缺乏深度的风险，需要更多模型比较和测试

Abstract: We analyzed 83 persona prompts from 27 research articles that used large
language models (LLMs) to generate user personas. Findings show that the
prompts predominantly generate single personas. Several prompts express a
desire for short or concise persona descriptions, which deviates from the
tradition of creating rich, informative, and rounded persona profiles. Text is
the most common format for generated persona attributes, followed by numbers.
Text and numbers are often generated together, and demographic attributes are
included in nearly all generated personas. Researchers use up to 12 prompts in
a single study, though most research uses a small number of prompts. Comparison
and testing multiple LLMs is rare. More than half of the prompts require the
persona output in a structured format, such as JSON, and 74% of the prompts
insert data or dynamic variables. We discuss the implications of increased use
of computational personas for user representation.

Abstract: Studying adversarial robustness of quantum machine learning (QML) models is
essential in order to understand their potential advantages over classical
models and build trustworthy systems. Distributing QML models allows leveraging
multiple quantum processors to overcome the limitations of individual devices
and build scalable systems. However, this distribution can affect their
adversarial robustness, potentially making them more vulnerable to new attacks.
Key paradigms in distributed QML include federated learning, which, similar to
classical models, involves training a shared model on local data and sending
only the model updates, as well as circuit distribution methods inherent to
quantum computing, such as circuit cutting and teleportation-based techniques.
These quantum-specific methods enable the distributed execution of quantum
circuits across multiple devices. This work reviews the differences between
these distribution methods, summarizes existing approaches on the adversarial
robustness of QML models when distributed using each paradigm, and discusses
open questions in this area.

Abstract: Flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative
modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex
distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce Quantum
Flow Matching (QFM)-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient
interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation
of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating
observables, and can be realized on a quantum computer without the need for
costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications:
(i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement
entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the
quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion
breakdown. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for
generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential
to revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in
a distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of
available quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit
simulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks
such as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore,
designing and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and
resource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model
convergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during
training with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current
simulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training
purposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we
introduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL
experiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time,
epoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to
monitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL
offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of
use and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the
number of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum
hyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator
suitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback
following each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically
illustrating learning curves. SimQFL is a practical and interactive platform
enabling academics and developers to prototype, analyze, and tune quantum
neural networks with greater transparency and control in distributed quantum
networks.

TL;DR: 本文分析了状态空间模型在内存计算架构下的噪声鲁棒性问题，发现最终块和输出投影层对扰动最敏感，并提出了一种混合投影分解策略HPD来提升模型在噪声条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在内存计算架构中具有计算效率优势，但设备非理想性导致的权重扰动会严重影响推理精度，需要系统分析其鲁棒性并提出有效的解决方案。

Method: 通过系统分析识别敏感组件，提出HPD混合投影分解策略：将最终输出投影层的权重矩阵分解为U和Σ（在内存中计算），将V转置卸载到数字硬件进行精确校正，保持硬件兼容性。

Result: 在Mamba模型上的测试显示，该方法在各种噪声条件下将困惑度降低高达99.57%，在PIQA常识推理基准上的准确率提升高达96.67%。

Conclusion: HPD方法有效解决了状态空间模型在内存计算架构中的噪声敏感问题，显著提升了模型在非理想硬件条件下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are efficient alternatives to traditional sequence
models, excelling at processing long sequences with lower computational
complexity. Their reliance on matrix multiplications makes them ideal for
compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures, which improve energy efficiency by
computing within memory arrays. However, device non-idealities in CIM introduce
weight perturbations that can degrade inference accuracy. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the robustness of SSMs under noisy conditions,
identifying that the final block and output projection layers are more
susceptible to perturbations compared to other components. Building on these
insights, we propose HPD, a Hybrid Projection Decomposition strategy for the
last output projection layer. We replace the original weight matrix with the
multiplication of U and {\Sigma} in its SVD to ensure compatibility with
existing hardware architectures, while offloading V> to digital hardware for
precise and robust correction. Comprehensive tests on Mamba models show that
our method reduces perplexity by up to 99.57% under various noise conditions
compared to baseline models, with accuracy gains of up to 96.67% on the PIQA
benchmark for commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages for edge robotics applications due
to their asynchronous operation and sparse, event-driven output, making them
well-suited for tasks requiring fast and efficient closed-loop control, such as
gesture-based human-robot interaction. Despite this potential, existing event
processing solutions remain limited, often lacking complete end-to-end
implementations, exhibiting high latency, and insufficiently exploiting event
data sparsity. In this paper, we present HOMI, an ultra-low latency, end-to-end
edge AI platform comprising a Prophesee IMX636 event sensor chip with an Xilinx
Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC FPGA chip, deploying an in-house developed AI
accelerator. We have developed hardware-optimized pre-processing pipelines
supporting both constant-time and constant-event modes for histogram
accumulation, linear and exponential time surfaces. Our general-purpose
implementation caters to both accuracy-driven and low-latency applications.
HOMI achieves 94% accuracy on the DVS Gesture dataset as a use case when
configured for high accuracy operation and provides a throughput of 1000 fps
for low-latency configuration. The hardware-optimised pipeline maintains a
compact memory footprint and utilises only 33% of the available LUT resources
on the FPGA, leaving ample headroom for further latency reduction, model
parallelisation, multi-task deployments, or integration of more complex
architectures.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种构建Excel公式修复测试数据集的新方法，通过结合LLM准备和验证框架生成了618个高质量样本，并评估了多个LLM的表现。


<details>

Motivation: Excel作为普遍但复杂的工具，新手用户常遇到语义运行错误。当前缺乏高质量的数据集来训练和评估自动修复模型。

Method: 提出了一个数据生成流水线，利用少量粒子样本通过LLM少见提示扩展数据集，采用LLM-as-a-Judge验证框架结合执行检查确保数据质量。

Abstract: Excel is a pervasive yet often complex tool, particularly for novice users,
where runtime errors arising from logical mistakes or misinterpretations of
functions pose a significant challenge. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising assistance by explaining formula errors, the automated
correction of these semantic runtime errors remains an open problem. A primary
challenge to advancing models for such scenarios is the severe lack of
high-quality, comprehensive datasets for training and rigorous evaluation. This
paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel approach for constructing a
benchmark dataset specifically designed for Excel formula repair. We propose a
data generation pipeline, which leverages a small set of curated seed samples
from online forums to synthetically expand the dataset. Our pipeline integrates
few-shot prompting with LLMs and employs a robust \textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}
validation framework, combined with execution-based checks to ensure the
correctness and semantic fidelity of the generated data. This process produced
a benchmark dataset of 618 high-quality samples, covering common runtime
errors. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware baseline technique for Excel
formula repair that utilizes LLMs to leverage both the faulty formula, and
relevant spreadsheet context. We evaluate the performance of various LLMs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在软件工程中的集成带来了革命性的代码生成能力，但也引入了严重的安全风险，如不安全代码生成、幻觉输出、不可逆操作以及缺乏透明度和问责制，迫切需要建立稳健的安全治理机制。

Method: 提出SAFE-AI整体框架，集成护栏、沙盒、运行时验证、风险感知日志、人在回路系统和可解释AI技术；建立AI行为分类法，将行为分为建议性、生成性、自主性和破坏性四类以指导风险评估。

Result: 构建了一个全面的风险缓解框架，提供了详细的自主控制、提示工程、可解释性和治理框架比较，为负责任的AI集成提供了路线图。

Conclusion: 该研究为软件工程中负责任的AI集成提供了系统性的解决方案，与欧盟AI法案和加拿大AIDA等新兴法规保持一致，确保AI驱动开发的安全、透明和问责。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software engineering has
revolutionized code generation, enabling unprecedented productivity through
promptware and autonomous AI agents. However, this transformation introduces
significant risks, including insecure code generation, hallucinated outputs,
irreversible actions, and a lack of transparency and accountability. Incidents
like the Replit database deletion underscore the urgent need for robust safety
and governance mechanisms. This paper comprehensively analyzes the inherent
challenges of LLM-assisted code generation, such as vulnerability inheritance,
overtrust, misinterpretation, and the absence of standardized validation and
rollback protocols. To address these, we propose the SAFE-AI Framework, a
holistic approach emphasizing Safety, Auditability, Feedback, and
Explainability. The framework integrates guardrails, sandboxing, runtime
verification, risk-aware logging, human-in-the-loop systems, and explainable AI
techniques to mitigate risks while fostering trust and compliance. We introduce
a novel taxonomy of AI behaviors categorizing suggestive, generative,
autonomous, and destructive actions to guide risk assessment and oversight.
Additionally, we identify open problems, including the lack of standardized
benchmarks for code specific hallucinations and autonomy levels, and propose
future research directions for hybrid verification, semantic guardrails, and
proactive governance tools. Through detailed comparisons of autonomy control,
prompt engineering, explainability, and governance frameworks, this paper
provides a roadmap for responsible AI integration in software engineering,
aligning with emerging regulations like the EU AI Act and Canada's AIDA to
ensure safe, transparent, and accountable AI-driven development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代软件交付已加速到每日多次部署，但人工决策点（如解释不稳定测试、选择回滚策略等）仍然是延迟和操作负担的主要来源

Method: 提出参考架构将代理决策点嵌入CI/CD，包括决策分类法、策略即代码护栏模式、分阶段自主信任框架、使用DORA指标和AI特定指标的评估方法，以及工业级案例研究

Result: 通过React 19微服务迁移到AI增强流水线的案例研究，展示了该方法在实践中的可行性

Conclusion: 讨论了伦理、验证、可审计性和有效性威胁，并为生产交付系统中的可验证自主性制定了路线图

Abstract: Modern software delivery has accelerated from quarterly releases to multiple
deployments per day. While CI/CD tooling has matured, human decision points
interpreting flaky tests, choosing rollback strategies, tuning feature flags,
and deciding when to promote a canary remain major sources of latency and
operational toil. We propose AI-Augmented CI/CD Pipelines, where large language
models (LLMs) and autonomous agents act as policy-bounded co-pilots and
progressively as decision makers. We contribute: (1) a reference architecture
for embedding agentic decision points into CI/CD, (2) a decision taxonomy and
policy-as-code guardrail pattern, (3) a trust-tier framework for staged
autonomy, (4) an evaluation methodology using DevOps Research and Assessment (
DORA) metrics and AI-specific indicators, and (5) a detailed industrial-style
case study migrating a React 19 microservice to an AI-augmented pipeline. We
discuss ethics, verification, auditability, and threats to validity, and chart
a roadmap for verifiable autonomy in production delivery systems.

*Arshia Akhavan,Alireza Hosseinpour,Abbas Heydarnoori,Mehdi Keshani*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LinkAnchor是一个基于LLM的自主代理，用于恢复issue到commit的链接，通过动态检索相关上下文和自动定位目标commit，性能比现有方法提升60-262%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有issue-commit链接恢复方法存在两个主要问题：LLM受限于上下文窗口无法处理所有可用数据源；大多数方法需要逐个评估issue-commit对，这在大型仓库中不实用。

Method: 采用惰性访问架构，动态检索最相关的上下文数据（提交历史、issue评论、代码文件），避免超出token限制；能够自动定位目标commit而不是穷举所有候选。

Result: 在所有案例研究项目中，LinkAnchor在Hit@1分数上比最先进的issue-commit链接恢复方法高出60-262%。

Conclusion: LinkAnchor是第一个用于issue-commit链接恢复的自主LLM代理，解决了现有方法的局限性，性能显著提升，并已公开发布为即用工具。

Abstract: Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software
traceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging
task. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly
linked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development
and research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based
approaches, and with the recent development of large language models,
researchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer
from two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows
and cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit
histories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most
methods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single
issue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This
quickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of
thousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the
first autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery.
The lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access
the rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files,
without exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most
relevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically
pinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible
candidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art
issue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all
our case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use
tool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for
GitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.

Motivation: 之前的研究多在受控环境中进行，本文通过分析实际工作环境中的用户评论来获取更真实的视角和需求。

Method: 识别1,085个VS Code市场上的AI编码助手扩展，并从32个有足够安装和评论的助手中手动采样分析用户评论，构建用户关注点和反馈的分类系统。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现提出五个实践意义和建议，以指导AI编码助手的改进和优化，更好满足用户需求。

Abstract: This paper aims to explore fundamental questions in the era when AI coding
assistants like GitHub Copilot are widely adopted: what do developers truly
value and criticize in AI coding assistants, and what does this reveal about
their needs and expectations in real-world software development? Unlike
previous studies that conduct observational research in controlled and
simulated environments, we analyze extensive, first-hand user reviews of AI
coding assistants, which capture developers' authentic perspectives and
experiences drawn directly from their actual day-to-day work contexts. We
identify 1,085 AI coding assistants from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
Although they only account for 1.64% of all extensions, we observe a surge in
these assistants: over 90% of them are released within the past two years. We
then manually analyze the user reviews sampled from 32 AI coding assistants
that have sufficient installations and reviews to construct a comprehensive
taxonomy of user concerns and feedback about these assistants. We manually
annotate each review's attitude when mentioning certain aspects of coding
assistants, yielding nuanced insights into user satisfaction and
dissatisfaction regarding specific features, concerns, and overall tool
performance. Built on top of the findings-including how users demand not just
intelligent suggestions but also context-aware, customizable, and
resource-efficient interactions-we propose five practical implications and
suggestions to guide the enhancement of AI coding assistants that satisfy user
needs.

Method: 使用统一提示词在广泛使用的基准测试上评估代码正确性，分析误判根因并提出两种改进的提示策略

Result: 发现LLMs频繁误分类正确代码，复杂提示技术（如解释和修正建议）导致更高的误判率

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs在代码需求匹配方面的未识别局限性，为自动化代码审查和任务导向代理场景提供了实用指导

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software
development, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and
review tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system
code implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code
robustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably
determine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions,
which is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a
systematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural
language requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ
unified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs
frequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying
requirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex
prompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving
explanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which
highlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review
assistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and
propose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time,
our findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with
requirements. We also offer novel insights and practical guidance for effective
use of LLMs in automated code review and task-oriented agent scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel data-driven symplectic induced-order modeling (ROM)
framework for high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems that unifies latent-space
discovery and dynamics learning within a single, end-to-end neural
architecture. The encoder-decoder is built from Henon neural networks
(HenonNets) and may be augmented with linear SGS-reflector layers. This yields
an exact symplectic map between full and latent phase spaces. Latent dynamics
are advanced by a symplectic flow map implemented as a HenonNet. This unified
neural architecture ensures exact preservation of the underlying symplectic
structure at the reduced-order level, significantly enhancing the fidelity and
long-term stability of the resulting ROM. We validate our method through
comprehensive numerical experiments on canonical Hamiltonian systems. The
results demonstrate the method's capability for accurate trajectory
reconstruction, robust predictive performance beyond the training horizon, and
accurate Hamiltonian preservation. These promising outcomes underscore the
effectiveness and potential applicability of our symplectic ROM framework for
complex dynamical systems across a broad range of scientific and engineering
disciplines.

Abstract: Energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is critical to network lifetime and
data delivery. However, the primary impediment to the durability and
dependability of these sensor nodes is their short battery life. Currently,
power-saving algorithms such as clustering and routing algorithms have improved
energy efficiency in standard protocols. This paper proposes a clustering-based
routing approach for creating an adaptive, energy-efficient mechanism. Our
system employs a multi-step clustering strategy to select dynamic cluster heads
(CH) with optimal energy distribution. We use Game Theory (GT) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize resource utilization. Modeling the
network as a multi-agent RL problem using GT principles allows for
self-clustering while optimizing sensor lifetime and energy balance. The
proposed AI-powered CH-Finding algorithm improves network efficiency by
preventing premature energy depletion in specific nodes while also ensuring
uniform energy usage across the network. Our solution enables controlled power
consumption, resulting in a deterministic network lifetime. This predictability
lowers maintenance costs by reducing the need for node replacement.
Furthermore, our proposed method prevents sensor nodes from disconnecting from
the network by designating the sensor with the highest charge as an
intermediary and using single-hop routing. This approach improves the energy
efficiency and stability of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments.

Abstract: Forecasting from atmospheric soundings is a fundamental task in operational
meteorology, often requiring structured visual reasoning over Skew-T log-P
diagrams by human forecasters. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have shown promise in other scientific domains, their application to
meteorological diagram interpretation remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams
using a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human
forecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models
to identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question
answering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate
precipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs
include either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from
operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with
three-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations
network. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill
comparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static
atmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and
reasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map
analysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological
features. These findings highlight the potential of compact, interpretable
multimodal models to support weather forecasting tasks. The approach offers a
computationally efficient alternative to large-scale systems, and future work
could extend it to more complex applications.

Abstract: Brain-like intelligent systems need brain-like learning methods. Equilibrium
Propagation (EP) is a biologically plausible learning framework with strong
potential for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, existing
im-plementations of EP suffer from instability and prohibi-tively high
computational costs. Inspired by the structure and dynamics of the brain, we
propose a biologically plau-sible Feedback-regulated REsidual recurrent neural
network (FRE-RNN) and study its learning performance in EP framework. Feedback
regulation enables rapid convergence by reducing the spectral radius. The
improvement in con-vergence property reduces the computational cost and
train-ing time of EP by orders of magnitude, delivering perfor-mance on par
with backpropagation (BP) in benchmark tasks. Meanwhile, residual connections
with brain-inspired topologies help alleviate the vanishing gradient problem
that arises when feedback pathways are weak in deep RNNs. Our approach
substantially enhances the applicabil-ity and practicality of EP in large-scale
networks that un-derpin artificial intelligence. The techniques developed here
also offer guidance to implementing in-situ learning in physical neural

Motivation: 传统SNN主要关注加权输入，忽略了神经元内部参数的优化潜力。现有方法未能有效处理时空神经数据的分类问题，需要更生物合理且可解释的分类框架。

Result: 根据训练方法不同，分类器效率最高提升11.00%，证明学习额外神经元参数比仅关注加权输入更有优势。

Conclusion: 概率元神经元模型和SNN-LZC结合框架为时空神经数据分类提供了更高效、生物合理且可解释的解决方案，突破了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach by replacing the traditional
perceptron neuron model with a biologically inspired probabilistic meta neuron,
where the internal neuron parameters are jointly learned, leading to improved
classification accuracy of spiking neural networks (SNNs). To validate this
innovation, we implement and compare two SNN architectures: one based on
standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons and another utilizing the
proposed probabilistic meta neuron model. As a second key contribution, we
present a new biologically inspired classification framework that uniquely
integrates SNNs with Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) a measure closely related to
entropy rate. By combining the temporal precision and biological plausibility
of SNNs with the capacity of LZC to capture structural regularity, the proposed
approach enables efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal
neural data, an aspect not addressed in existing works. We consider learning
algorithms such as backpropagation, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP),
and the Tempotron learning rule. To explore neural dynamics, we use Poisson
processes to model neuronal spike trains, a well-established method for
simulating the stochastic firing behavior of biological neurons. Our results
reveal that depending on the training method, the classifier's efficiency can
improve by up to 11.00%, highlighting the advantage of learning additional
neuron parameters beyond the traditional focus on weighted inputs alone.

Abstract: This paper presents ASPEN, a novel energy-aware technique for neuromorphic
systems that could unleash the future of intelligent, always-on,
ultra-low-power, and low-burden wearables. Our main research objectives are to
explore the feasibility of neuromorphic computing for wearables, identify open
research directions, and demonstrate the feasibility of developing an adaptive
spiking technique for energy-aware computation, which can be game-changing for
resource-constrained devices in always-on applications. As neuromorphic
computing systems operate based on spike events, their energy consumption is
closely related to spiking activity, i.e., each spike incurs computational and
power costs; consequently, minimizing the number of spikes is a critical
strategy for operating under constrained energy budgets. To support this goal,
ASPEN utilizes stochastic perturbations to the neuronal threshold during
training to not only enhance the network's robustness across varying
thresholds, which can be controlled at inference time, but also act as a
regularizer that improves generalization, reduces spiking activity, and enables
energy control without the need for complex retraining or pruning. More
specifically, ASPEN adaptively adjusts intrinsic neuronal parameters as a
lightweight and scalable technique for dynamic energy control without
reconfiguring the entire model. Our evaluation on neuromorphic emulator and
hardware shows that ASPEN significantly reduces spike counts and energy
consumption while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and
extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific
computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated,
data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming
(CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both
modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying
conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted
evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality
assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves
interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results
demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for
interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a
potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising approach to low-power
applications on neuromorphic hardware due to their energy efficiency. However,
training SNNs is challenging because of the non-differentiable spike generation
function. To address this issue, the commonly used approach is to adopt the
backpropagation through time framework, while assigning the gradient of the
non-differentiable function with some surrogates. Similarly, Binary Neural
Networks (BNNs) also face the non-differentiability problem and rely on
approximating gradients. However, the deep relationship between these two
fields and how their training techniques can benefit each other has not been
systematically researched. Furthermore, training binary-weight SNNs is even
more difficult. In this work, we present a novel perspective on the dynamics of
SNNs and their close connection to BNNs through an analysis of the
backpropagation process. We demonstrate that training a feedforward SNN can be
viewed as training a self-ensemble of a binary-activation neural network with
noise injection. Drawing from this new understanding of SNN dynamics, we
introduce the Self-Ensemble Inspired training method for (Binary-Weight) SNNs
(SEI-BWSNN), which achieves high-performance results with low latency even for
the case of the 1-bit weights. Specifically, we leverage a structure of
multiple shortcuts and a knowledge distillation-based training technique to

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is
crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody
development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic
diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in
silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and
conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in
predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based
model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody
complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local
features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen
sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of
linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of
conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms
existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on
conformational epitopes.

Conclusion: EXOTIC为凸-非凹和非凸-凹min-max优化提供了有效的全局优化方法，具有理论保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Min-max optimization arises in many domains such as game theory, adversarial
machine learning, etc., with gradient-based methods as a typical computational
tool. Beyond convex-concave min-max optimization, the solutions found by
gradient-based methods may be arbitrarily far from global optima. In this work,
we present an algorithmic apparatus for computing globally optimal solutions in
convex-non-concave and non-convex-concave min-max optimization. For former, we
employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min
optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective
function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax
theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm
for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative
convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and
a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select
promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by
convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap
as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's
convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters. Both our
algorithmic apparatus along with its accompanying theoretical analysis can also
be applied for non-convex-concave min-max optimization. In addition, we propose
a class of benchmark convex-non-concave min-max problems along with their
analytical global solutions, providing a testbed for evaluating algorithms for
min-max optimization. Empirically, EXOTIC outperforms gradient-based methods on
this benchmark as well as on existing numerical benchmark problems from the
literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of EXOTIC by computing security
strategies in multi-player games with three or more players.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This article introduces a decentralized robust optimization framework for
safe multi-agent control under uncertainty. Although stochastic noise has been
the primary form of modeling uncertainty in such systems, these formulations
might fall short in addressing uncertainties that are deterministic in nature
or simply lack probabilistic data. To ensure safety under such scenarios, we
employ the concept of robust constraints that must hold for all possible
uncertainty realizations lying inside a bounded set. Nevertheless, standard
robust optimization approaches become intractable due to the large number or
non-convexity of the constraints involved in safe multi-agent control. To
address this, we introduce novel robust reformulations that significantly
reduce complexity without compromising safety. The applicability of the
framework is further broadened to address both deterministic and stochastic
uncertainties by incorporating robust chance constraints and distribution
steering techniques. To achieve scalability, we derive a distributed approach
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), supported by a
convergence study that accounts for the underlying non-convexity. In addition,
computational complexity bounds highlighting the efficiency of the proposed
frameworks against standard approaches are presented. Finally, the robustness
and scalability of the framework is demonstrated through extensive simulation
results across diverse scenarios, including environments with nonconvex
obstacles and up to 246 agents.

Result: 实验结果显示，特定的紧凑策略组合能够显著缩短解题时间，尤其是考虑良行为CPWL解的策略。

Conclusion: 该方法通过紧凑MILP模型有效提高了高维CPWL近似问题的计算效率。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tightening the mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) formulation for continuous piecewise linear (CPWL)
approximations of data sets in arbitrary dimensions. The MILP formulation
leverages the difference-of-convex (DC) representation of CPWL functions. We
introduce the concept of well-behaved CPWL interpolations and demonstrate that
any CPWL interpolation of a data set has a well-behaved version. This result is
critical to tighten the MILP problem. We present six different strategies to
tighten the problem, which include fixing the values of some variables,
introducing additional constraints, identifying small big-M parameter values
and applying tighter variable bounds. These methods leverage key aspects of the
DC representation and the inherent structure of well-behaved CPWL
interpolations. Experimental results demonstrate that specific combinations of
these tightening strategies lead to significant improvement in solution times,
especially for tightening strategies that consider well-behaved CPWL solutions.

Conclusion: 该模型为群体公平性分配提供了灵活的软约束方案，算法在理论和实践中都有良好表现，尽管交叉群体情况下问题变得难解

Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning items to platforms where each item has a
utility associated with each of the platforms to which it can be assigned. Each
platform has a soft constraint over the total number of items it serves,
modeled via a convex cost function. Additionally, items are partitioned into
groups, and each platform also incurs group-specific convex cost over the
number of items from each group that can be assigned to the platform. These
costs promote group fairness by penalizing imbalances, yielding a soft
variation of fairness notions introduced in prior work, such as Restricted
Dominance and Minority protection. Restricted Dominance enforces upper bounds
on group representation, while Minority protection enforces lower bounds. Our
approach replaces such hard constraints with cost-based penalties, allowing
more flexible trade-offs. Our model also captures Nash Social Welfare kind of
objective.
  The cost of an assignment is the sum of the values of all the cost functions
across all the groups and platforms. The objective is to find an assignment
that minimizes the cost while achieving a total utility that is at least a
user-specified threshold. The main challenge lies in balancing the overall
platform cost with group-specific costs, both governed by convex functions,
while meeting the utility constraint. We present an efficient polynomial-time
approximation algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental
evaluation. Our algorithm is based on techniques involving linear programming
and network flows. We also provide an exact algorithm for a special case with
uniform utilities and establish the hardness of the general problem when the
groups can intersect arbitrarily.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了理论科学中新的人机协作范式：人类在更高抽象层次推理，使用符号压缩搜索空间，AI在其中探索，实现两者单独都无法完成的成果

Abstract: Algorithm design and analysis is a cornerstone of computer science, but it
confronts a major challenge. Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee
across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone
human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific
problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such
provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems
from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design
with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose
LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental
and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria.
LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like
language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives
and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a
state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art
algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human
researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a
novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work
demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical
science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress
the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could
alone.

Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic
charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model
is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only)
for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess
the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new
data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results
demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training
generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data
sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via
transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed
method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event
generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.

Abstract: This paper explores integrating microlearning strategies into university
curricula, particularly in computer science education, to counteract the
decline in class attendance and engagement in US universities after COVID. As
students increasingly opt for remote learning and recorded lectures,
traditional educational approaches struggle to maintain engagement and
effectiveness. Microlearning, which breaks complex subjects into manageable
units, is proposed to address shorter attention spans and enhance educational
outcomes. It uses interactive formats such as videos, quizzes, flashcards, and
scenario-based exercises, which are especially beneficial for topics like
algorithms and programming logic requiring deep understanding and ongoing
practice. Adoption of microlearning is often limited by the effort needed to
create such materials. This paper proposes leveraging AI tools, specifically
ChatGPT, to reduce the workload for educators by automating the creation of
supplementary materials. While AI can automate certain tasks, educators remain
essential in guiding and shaping the learning process. This AI-enhanced
approach ensures course content is kept current with the latest research and
technology, with educators providing context and insights. By examining AI
capabilities in microlearning, this study shows the potential to transform
educational practices and outcomes in computer science, offering a practical
model for combining advanced technology with established teaching methods.

Abstract: Child safety continues to be a paramount concern worldwide, with child
abduction posing significant threats to communities. This paper presents the
development of an edge-based child abduction detection and alert system
utilizing a multi-agent framework where each agent incorporates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) deployed on a Raspberry Pi. Leveraging the advanced capabilities
of VLMs within individual agents of a multi-agent team, our system is trained
to accurately detect and interpret complex interactions involving children in
various environments in real-time. The multi-agent system is deployed on a
Raspberry Pi connected to a webcam, forming an edge device capable of
processing video feeds, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. An
integrated alert system utilizes the Twilio API to send immediate SMS and
WhatsApp notifications, including calls and messages, when a potential child
abduction event is detected. Experimental results demonstrate that the system
achieves high accuracy in detecting potential abduction scenarios, with near
real-time performance suitable for practical deployment. The multi-agent
architecture enhances the system's ability to process complex situational data,
improving detection capabilities over traditional single-model approaches. The
edge deployment ensures scalability and cost-effectiveness, making it
accessible for widespread use. The proposed system offers a proactive solution
to enhance child safety through continuous monitoring and rapid alerting,
contributing a valuable tool in efforts to prevent child abductions.

valued the system's adaptability, specificity, and ability to support
mid-course adjustments, while students appreciated the conversational format
and opportunity for elaboration. We conclude by discussing the design
implications of using AI to facilitate more meaningful and responsive feedback
in higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市中心的社会、人口和文化变化影响公共空间使用，需要系统性评估公共空间的包容性

Method: 混合方法研究，结合28名居民的半结构化访谈和图像评估，结合Mapillary提供的近45,000张街景图像进行AI分析

Result: 发现不同人口群体对包容性和可达性的感知存在差异，多样化用户反馈能够通过精心设计的数据标注和共同生产策略提升机器学习模型

Conclusion: Street Review框架为城市规划者和政策分析师提供了系统化方法，可以指导公共街道的规划、政策制定和管理

Abstract: Urban centers undergo social, demographic, and cultural changes that shape
public street use and require systematic evaluation of public spaces. This
study presents Street Review, a mixed-methods approach that combines
participatory research with AI-based analysis to assess streetscape
inclusivity. In Montr\'eal, Canada, 28 residents participated in semi-directed
interviews and image evaluations, supported by the analysis of approximately
45,000 street-view images from Mapillary. The approach produced visual
analytics, such as heatmaps, to correlate subjective user ratings with physical
attributes like sidewalk, maintenance, greenery, and seating. Findings reveal
variations in perceptions of inclusivity and accessibility across demographic
groups, demonstrating that incorporating diverse user feedback can enhance
machine learning models through careful data-labeling and co-production
strategies. The Street Review framework offers a systematic method for urban
planners and policy analysts to inform planning, policy development, and
management of public streets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的快速集成对高等教育的项目基础评估造成挑战，传统评估方法重视最终产品而忽视学习过程，导致产品真实性、学术整齿和学习效果验证的问题

Method: 提出一种重构的评估模型，包括：过程导向的评估、多模态和多面向的评估设计、以及与生成式AI的合理交互。模型还强调使用生成式AI辅助的个性化反馈来监控学习过程

Result: 通过一个顽石项目场景的应用案例，证明了该模型的可行性和实践效果

Conclusion: 为教育工作者和课程设计者提供了建议，确保在生成式AI不断发展的背景下，评估实践仍能保持健壮、以学习者为中心和整齿驱动

Abstract: The rapid integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into
higher education presents both opportunities and challenges for assessment
design, particularly within Project-Based Assessment (PBA) contexts.
Traditional assessment methods often emphasise the final product in the PBA,
which can now be significantly influenced or created by GenAI tools, raising
concerns regarding product authenticity, academic integrity, and learning
validation. This paper advocates for a reimagined assessment model for
Project-Based Learning (PBL) or a capstone project that prioritises
process-oriented evaluation, multi-modal and multifaceted assessment design,
and ethical engagement with GenAI to enable higher-order thinking. The model
also emphasises the use of (GenAI-assisted) personalised feedback by a
supervisor as an observance of the learning process during the project
lifecycle. A use case scenario is provided to illustrate the application of the
model in a capstone project setting. The paper concludes with recommendations
for educators and curriculum designers to ensure that assessment practices
remain robust, learner-centric, and integrity-driven in the evolving landscape
of GenAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI风险预测的不同社会技术想象如何形成治理决策和监管约束，揭示这些想象对政策制定过程的影响。

Method: 基于科学技术研究概念，分析三组主导史述：存在风险支持者、加速主义者和批判AI学者。通过分析代表性声明文本，探索这些想象在四个维度上的差异：未来规范视野、现状诊断、科技观和人类能动性。

Result: 研究发现这些史述嵌入了对风险的不同假设，有可能通过缩小替代性治理方案的空间来推进政策制定过程。

Conclusion: 反对截然性的想象主义，建议超越决定论想象，采用基于实用主义的监管策略，以更好地应对AI风险。

Abstract: This paper examines how competing sociotechnical imaginaries of artificial
intelligence (AI) risk shape governance decisions and regulatory constraints.
Drawing on concepts from science and technology studies, we analyse three
dominant narrative groups: existential risk proponents, who emphasise
catastrophic AGI scenarios; accelerationists, who portray AI as a
transformative force to be unleashed; and critical AI scholars, who foreground
present-day harms rooted in systemic inequality. Through an analysis of
representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ
across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the
present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human
agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed
distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into
policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance
approaches. We argue against speculative dogmatism and for moving beyond
deterministic imaginaries toward regulatory strategies that are grounded in
pragmatism.

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述研究了人工智能（特别是多模态基础模型和大语言模型）在农村医疗中的变革潜力，分析了109项研究，发现AI能显著改善医疗服务可及性、质量和效率，但也面临基础设施、数据质量和伦理等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农村医疗面临基础设施不足、医护人员短缺和社会经济差异等长期挑战，阻碍了基本医疗服务的获取，需要探索AI技术如何解决这些 underserved 地区的医疗问题。

Method: 采用系统综述方法，检索2019-2024年间PubMed、Embase、Web of Science、IEEE Xplore和Scopus数据库的109项研究，使用PRISMA指南和Covidence软件进行筛选，并进行主题分析识别AI在农村医疗实施的关键模式。

Result: 研究发现AI应用（预测分析、远程医疗平台、自动化诊断工具）在农村医疗中具有显著潜力。多模态基础模型能整合多种数据源支持综合决策，大语言模型能促进临床文档、患者分诊、翻译和虚拟协助，共同通过增强人力能力、减少诊断延迟和普及专业知识来革新农村医疗。

Conclusion: 虽然AI技术具有变革潜力，但仍面临基础设施限制、数据质量问题和伦理考虑等障碍。需要跨学科合作、数字基础设施投资和监管框架开发，以确保AI在农村医疗系统中的公平和可持续整合。

Abstract: Rural healthcare faces persistent challenges, including inadequate
infrastructure, workforce shortages, and socioeconomic disparities that hinder
access to essential services. This study investigates the transformative
potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in addressing these issues in
underserved rural areas. We systematically reviewed 109 studies published
between 2019 and 2024 from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and
Scopus. Articles were screened using PRISMA guidelines and Covidence software.
A thematic analysis was conducted to identify key patterns and insights
regarding AI implementation in rural healthcare delivery. The findings reveal
significant promise for AI applications, such as predictive analytics,
telemedicine platforms, and automated diagnostic tools, in improving healthcare
accessibility, quality, and efficiency. Among these, advanced AI systems,
including Multimodal Foundation Models (MFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs),
offer particularly transformative potential. MFMs integrate diverse data
sources, such as imaging, clinical records, and bio signals, to support
comprehensive decision-making, while LLMs facilitate clinical documentation,
patient triage, translation, and virtual assistance. Together, these
technologies can revolutionize rural healthcare by augmenting human capacity,
reducing diagnostic delays, and democratizing access to expertise. However,
barriers remain, including infrastructural limitations, data quality concerns,
and ethical considerations. Addressing these challenges requires
interdisciplinary collaboration, investment in digital infrastructure, and the
development of regulatory frameworks. This review offers actionable
recommendations and highlights areas for future research to ensure equitable
and sustainable integration of AI in rural healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 研究分析了388名大学生使用ChatGPT完成作业的行为，通过XGBoost算法建立预测模型，准确率达80.1%，发现学习习惯、学科偏好和对AI态度是关键预测因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等生成式AI工具的兴起，需要定量分析学生在完成作业时的行为模式，了解这些工具对实际学术实践的影响

Method: 调查388名大学生（主要来自俄罗斯，包含部分国际学生），使用XGBoost算法建立二元分类器和多类分类器模型，分析预测ChatGPT使用的关键因素

Result: 二元分类器测试准确率80.1%，敏感性80.2%，特异性79.9%；多类分类器准确率64.5%，精度64.6%，召回率64.5%；发现经常使用ChatGPT学习新概念与激过依赖相关

Conclusion: 生成式AI虽能提升知识获取效率，但无节制依赖可能毁害承负思维和创造力；建议制定学科特定指南和重构考核策略，以平衡创新与学术严谨性

Abstract: The rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has significantly reshaped
education, sparking debates about their impact on learning outcomes and
academic integrity. While prior research highlights opportunities and risks,
there remains a lack of quantitative analysis of student behavior when
completing assignments. Understanding how these tools influence real-world
academic practices, particularly assignment preparation, is a pressing and
timely research priority.
  This study addresses this gap by analyzing survey responses from 388
university students, primarily from Russia, including a subset of international
participants. Using the XGBoost algorithm, we modeled predictors of ChatGPT
usage in academic assignments. Key predictive factors included learning habits,
subject preferences, and student attitudes toward AI. Our binary classifier
demonstrated strong predictive performance, achieving 80.1\% test accuracy,
with 80.2\% sensitivity and 79.9\% specificity. The multiclass classifier
achieved 64.5\% test accuracy, 64.6\% weighted precision, and 64.5\% recall,
with similar training scores, indicating potential data scarcity challenges.
  The study reveals that frequent use of ChatGPT for learning new concepts
correlates with potential overreliance, raising concerns about long-term
academic independence. These findings suggest that while generative AI can
enhance access to knowledge, unchecked reliance may erode critical thinking and
originality. We propose discipline-specific guidelines and reimagined
assessment strategies to balance innovation with academic rigor. These insights
can guide educators and policymakers in ethically and effectively integrating
AI into education.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型设计个性化助推策略，提高航空旅客自愿碳抵消率3-7%，每年额外减少230万吨CO2排放


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统助推策略效果受个体偏好影响，而LLMs可以低成本模拟人类决策过程，为个性化助推提供新途径

Method: 利用LLMs设计个性化诱饵式助推策略，通过3495份来自5个国家的调查验证有效性

Result: 个性化助推比统一设置更有效，主要提高了对碳抵消计划信任度低的怀疑旅客的参与率

Conclusion: LLM驱动的个性化助推策略具有巨大潜力，可加速航空业脱碳进程

Abstract: Nudge strategies are effective tools for promoting sustainable behaviour, but
their impact depends on individual preferences. By emulating human
decision-making, large language models (LLMs) offer a cost-effective route for
tailoring nudges without extensive behavioural datasets, yet this potential
remains unexplored. Focusing on aviation, we use LLMs to design personalized
decoy-based nudge strategies that encourage air travellers to voluntarily
offset CO$_2$ emissions from flights, and validate their efficacy through 3495
surveys from China, Germany, India, Singapore, and the United States. Results
show that LLM-informed personalized nudges are more effective than uniform
settings, raising offsetting rates by 3-7$\%$ and yielding an additional 2.3
million tonnes of CO$_2$ mitigated annually in aviation. This improvement is
driven primarily by increased participation among sceptical travellers with low
trust in offset programmes. Our study highlights the potential of LLM-driven
personalized nudging strategies for boosting offsetting behaviours to
accelerate aviation decarbonization.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出"规制牺性"的欺诚，证明解除AI安全监管不会带来国家安全，而是增加共同危险，并呼吁建立更强的规制框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为全球政策制定者目前寻求通过解除安全监管来获得AI领先优势，这称为"规制牺性"，但这种思路存在致命缺陷

Method: 通过分析规制牺性的三个假诚：1）可持久技术领先优势；2）解规制促进创新；3）解规制增强国家安全。使用事实数据和历史类比来证明这些诺言的虚假性

Result: 证明了规制牺性的三个假诚都是错误的：AI技术差距在13个月内从9%缩小到2%；良好的规制实际促进创新和投资；解除规制在近中长期都会破坏国家安全

Conclusion: 规制牺性是一种致命的错误思路，它服务于权力利益而非真正的安全需求。唯一的胜利方式是不参与这种无保护的竞赛，而是建立更强大的规制框架来确保AI安全发展

Abstract: We have convinced ourselves that the way to make AI safe is to make it
unsafe. Since 2022, policymakers worldwide have embraced the Regulation
Sacrifice - the belief that dismantling safety oversight will deliver security
through AI dominance. Fearing China or USA will gain advantage, nations rush to
eliminate safeguards that might slow progress. This Essay reveals the fatal
flaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands
stronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails
breeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes
three false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI
capabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems
collapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages
evaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no
sense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite
often proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines
development. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce
uncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did
not kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced
national security through deregulation actually undermines security across all
timeframes. Near term: it hands adversaries information warfare tools. Medium
term: it democratizes bioweapon capabilities. Long term: it guarantees
deployment of uncontrollable AGI systems. The Regulation Sacrifice persists
because it serves powerful interests, not security. Tech companies prefer
freedom to accountability. Politicians prefer simple stories to complex truths.
This creates mutually assured deregulation, where each nation's sprint for
advantage guarantees collective vulnerability. The only way to win is not to
play.

TL;DR: 城市街道绿化比传统官方绿地指标更能预测健康改善，特别是高血压等疾病的药物使用减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统绿化指标只考虑绿地面积和距离，忽视了人们日常生活中实际看到和使用绿化的频率

Method: 结合航拍影像、OpenStreetMap绿化数据、10万张Google街景图片和16万条道路可达性估计，将绿化分为路上绿化和路外绿化，并与75亿份医疗处方进行关联分析

Result: 路上绿化与健康改善的关联性明显强于四种常用官方指标，高血压药物处方在绿化超过中位数的区域减少3.68%，每年可节省费315万英镑医疗费用

Conclusion: 日常生活中可见的绿化比公共但隐秘的绿地更重要，存在的官方绿化指标有重要限制

Abstract: Urban greenery is often linked to better health, yet findings from past
research have been inconsistent. One reason is that official greenery metrics
measure the amount or nearness of greenery but ignore how often people actually
may potentially see or use it in daily life. To address this gap, we introduced
a new classification that separates on-road greenery, which people see while
walking through streets, from off-road greenery, which requires planned visits.
We did so by combining aerial imagery of Greater London and greenery data from
OpenStreetMap with quantified greenery from over 100,000 Google Street View
images and accessibility estimates based on 160,000 road segments. We linked
these measures to 7.45 billion medical prescriptions issued by the National
Health Service and processed through our methodology. These prescriptions cover
five conditions: diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, and anxiety, as
well as opioid use. As hypothesized, we found that green on-road was more
strongly linked to better health than four widely used official measures. For
example, hypertension prescriptions dropped by 3.68% in wards with on-road
greenery above the median citywide level compared to those below it. If all
below-median wards reached the citywide median in on-road greenery,
prescription costs could fall by up to {\pounds}3.15 million each year. These
results suggest that greenery seen in daily life may be more relevant than
public yet secluded greenery, and that official metrics commonly used in the
literature have important limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络擅长模式识别但在逻辑推理方面不可靠，经常违反基本逻辑原则，需要构建具有可证明逻辑保证的神经网络架构

Method: 将逻辑理论视为Lawvere理论代数结构，使用参数映射2-范畴中的范畴代数将其转化为神经网络架构，直接在网络结构中嵌入逻辑原则

Result: 构建了可微分的命题逻辑神经网络架构，保持布尔推理能力同时可通过梯度下降训练，建立了有限逻辑理论与神经网络架构之间的双射对应关系

Conclusion: 该框架将范畴深度学习从几何对称性扩展到语义约束，能够从逻辑规范自动推导验证过的架构，为可信AI系统提供数学基础

Abstract: Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with reliable
logical reasoning, often violating basic logical principles during inference.
We address this limitation by developing a categorical framework that
systematically constructs neural architectures with provable logical
guarantees. Our approach treats logical theories as algebraic structures called
Lawvere theories, which we transform into neural networks using categorical
algebra in the 2-category of parametric maps. Unlike existing methods that
impose logical constraints during training, our categorical construction embeds
logical principles directly into the network's architectural structure, making
logical violations mathematically impossible. We demonstrate this framework by
constructing differentiable neural architectures for propositional logic that
preserve boolean reasoning while remaining trainable via gradient descent. Our
main theoretical result establishes a bijective correspondence between finitary
logical theories and neural architectures, proving that every logically
constrained network arises uniquely from our construction. This extends
Categorical Deep Learning beyond geometric symmetries to semantic constraints,
enabling automatic derivation of verified architectures from logical
specifications. The framework provides mathematical foundations for trustworthy
AI systems, with applications to theorem proving, formal verification, and
safety-critical reasoning tasks requiring verifiable logical behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病影响全球70%人口，诊断过程复杂且皮肤科医生短缺。现有AI模型依赖大量人工标注数据且任务单一，在真实场景中效果有限。

Method: 使用来自三个来源的432,776张图像训练，采用新颖的混合预训练框架，结合自监督学习、半监督学习和知识引导的原型初始化。

Result: 在20个数据集上持续超越最先进模型，在恶性肿瘤分类、疾病严重程度分级、多类别诊断和图像描述等高级任务中表现优异，在皮肤病变分割等低级任务中也达到最先进水平。在隐私保护联邦学习场景和不同肤色性别中表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DermNIO是一个强大的皮肤病学基础模型，能够显著提升诊断准确性并改善临床医生表现，为解决皮肤病诊断挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems,
driven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population),
complex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in
resource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have
demonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face
limitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built
for narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings.
To tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model
for dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three
sources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections),
DermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the
self-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and
knowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only
deepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also
substantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical
tasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level
clinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity
grading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also
achieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion
segmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in
privacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types
and sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved
95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance
improved clinician performance by 17.21%.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FractMorph是一个基于3D双并行Transformer的新型可变形图像配准架构，通过多域分数傅里叶变换分支增强跨图像特征匹配，在心脏MRI数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在统一框架中同时捕捉细粒度局部变形和大尺度全局变形，需要一种能够同时处理多尺度变形的端到端解决方案。

Method: 使用双并行Transformer架构，每个分数交叉注意力块应用0°、45°、90°的并行分数傅里叶变换以及对数幅度分支，同时提取局部、半全局和全局特征，通过交叉注意力融合固定图像和移动图像的特征，最后用轻量级U-Net预测密集变形场。

Result: 在ACDC心脏MRI数据集上达到86.45%的总体Dice相似系数，75.15%的平均每结构DSC，以及1.54mm的95%Hausdorff距离。轻量版FractMorph-Light仅需29.6M参数，保持相近精度但内存减半。

Conclusion: 多域谱空间注意力Transformer能够通过单一端到端网络稳健高效地建模医学图像中的复杂非刚性变形，无需场景特定调优或多尺度层次网络。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a crucial and challenging technique
for aligning anatomical structures in medical images and is widely applied in
diverse clinical applications. However, existing approaches often struggle to
capture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations
simultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D
dual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature
matching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches.
Each Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at
fractional angles of 0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, along with a log-magnitude
branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global features at the
same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between the fixed and
moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then predicts a dense
deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On the ACDC cardiac
MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.45%, an average per-structure DSC of
75.15%, and a 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95) of 1.54 mm on our data
split. We also introduce FractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model
with only 29.6M parameters, which maintains the superior accuracy of the main
model while using approximately half the memory. Our results demonstrate that
multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and
efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a
single end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or
hierarchical multi-scale networks. The source code of our implementation is
available at https://github.com/shayankebriti/FractMorph.

TL;DR: 通过系统评估多种MRI对比度输入对胺体核团分割的效果，发现T1映像单独使用就能获得优秀的定量和定性结果，而PD映像无额外价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的胺体核团分割对于理解神经系统疾病和应用临床干预至关重要，但最优的MRI输入方案仍不明确。

Method: 系统评估MPRAGE、FGATIR、定量PD和T1映像、以及不同反转时间的多平T1加权映像。对多平T1映像采用梯度基础的显著性分析和Monte Carlo dropout方法，提出综合重要性分数来选择最优图像。使用3D U-Net训练每种配置。

Result: T1映像单独使用即可获得强劲的定量表现和优秀的定性结果，PD映像则无额外价值。

Conclusion: T1映像是胺体核团分割的可靠高效输入选择，为临床或研究应用中的成像协议优化提供了有价值指导。

Abstract: Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation is crucial for understanding
neurological diseases, brain functions, and guiding clinical interventions.
However, the optimal inputs for segmentation remain unclear. This study
systematically evaluates multiple MRI contrasts, including MPRAGE and FGATIR
sequences, quantitative PD and T1 maps, and multiple T1-weighted images at
different inversion times (multi-TI), to determine the most effective inputs.
For multi-TI images, we employ a gradient-based saliency analysis with Monte
Carlo dropout and propose an Overall Importance Score to select the images
contributing most to segmentation. A 3D U-Net is trained on each of these
configurations. Results show that T1 maps alone achieve strong quantitative
performance and superior qualitative outcomes, while PD maps offer no added
value. These findings underscore the value of T1 maps as a reliable and
efficient input among the evaluated options, providing valuable guidance for
optimizing imaging protocols when thalamic structures are of clinical or

Result: 模型在钙化识别中达到了86.52%的准确率和0.8889的AUC值，较仅使用原始图像训练的模型提高了3.54%的准确率和0.0385的AUC值。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的钙化分类模型通过融合不同图像特征有效减少了结构干扰，显著提高了肺部结节钙化识别的诊断性能，为临床诊断提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Accurate and timely identification of pulmonary nodules on chest X-rays can
differentiate between life-saving early treatment and avoidable invasive
procedures. Calcification is a definitive indicator of benign nodules and is
the primary foundation for diagnosis. In actual practice, diagnosing pulmonary
nodule calcification on chest X-rays predominantly depends on the physician's
visual assessment, resulting in significant diversity in interpretation.
Furthermore, overlapping anatomical elements, such as ribs and spine,
complicate the precise identification of calcification patterns. This study
presents a calcification classification model that attains strong diagnostic
performance by utilizing fused features derived from raw images and their
structure-suppressed variants to reduce structural interference. We used 2,517
lesion-free images and 656 nodule images (151 calcified nodules and 550
non-calcified nodules), all obtained from Ajou University Hospital. The
suggested model attained an accuracy of 86.52% and an AUC of 0.8889 in
calcification diagnosis, surpassing the model trained on raw images by 3.54%
and 0.0385, respectively.

TL;DR: 基于原型学习和最优运输的无监督异常检测方法，通过平衡特征和空间成本来学习局部和全局原型，在工业图像异常检测上取得竞争性能效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在工业检测和医学影像等领域中，标签获取成本高或不想引入异常类型偏差的问题，需要一种无监督异常检测方法

Method: 提出基于原型学习的新方法，使用平衡特征和空间成本的指标来比较嵌入表示，利用最优运输从预训练图像编码器提取的潜在表示中学习局部和全局原型

Result: 在两个工业图像异常检测标准测试集上达到了与强基线相当的性能水平

Conclusion: 方法能够在学习原型时强化结构约束，抓取正常样本的基础组织结构，从而改善图像中不一致性的检测能力

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by
having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It
has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical
imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing
biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a
novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare
a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a
spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global
prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a
pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a
structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the
underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of
incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with
strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on
industrial images. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 通过调整基于TTE训练的投影模型，使用过渡适配器和轻量重映层，用少量TEE数据生成高保真度的结构控制TEE图像，提升下游分割任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度投影模型需要大量训练数据，而食管心超声扫描(TEE)领域数据稀缺，限制了深度学习在这个高影响模态中的应用

Method: 采用低秩适配(LoRA)结合MaskR$^2$轻量重映层，将TTE训练的投影模型适配到TEE领域，仅需少量新案例和小规模适配器

Result: 仅适配MLP层即可实现高保真度TEE生成，混合少于200张实际TEE帧的合成图像显著提升多类分割任务的Dice分数，尤其在不充分表示的右心结构上改善明显

Conclusion: 该方法能够以低开销生成语义可控的TEE图像，MaskR$^2$能够有效转换未见的投影格式，生成的图像对下游多类分割任务有效

Abstract: Deep diffusion models excel at realistic image synthesis but demand large
training sets-an obstacle in data-scarce domains like transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE). While synthetic augmentation has boosted performance in
transthoracic echo (TTE), TEE remains critically underrepresented, limiting the
reach of deep learning in this high-impact modality.
  We address this gap by adapting a TTE-trained, mask-conditioned diffusion
backbone to TEE with only a limited number of new cases and adapters as small
as $10^5$ parameters. Our pipeline combines Low-Rank Adaptation with MaskR$^2$,
a lightweight remapping layer that aligns novel mask formats with the
pretrained model's conditioning channels. This design lets users adapt models
to new datasets with a different set of anatomical structures to the base
model's original set.
  Through a targeted adaptation strategy, we find that adapting only MLP layers
suffices for high-fidelity TEE synthesis. Finally, mixing less than 200 real
TEE frames with our synthetic echoes improves the dice score on a multiclass
segmentation task, particularly boosting performance on underrepresented
right-heart structures. Our results demonstrate that (1) semantically
controlled TEE images can be generated with low overhead, (2) MaskR$^2$
effectively transforms unseen mask formats into compatible formats without
damaging downstream task performance, and (3) our method generates images that
are effective for improving performance on a downstream task of multiclass
segmentation.

Abstract: The deployment of dense, low-cost sensors is critical for realizing
ubiquitous smart environments. However, existing sensing solutions struggle
with the energy, scalability, and reliability trade-offs imposed by battery
maintenance, wireless transmission overhead, and data processing complexity. In
this work, we present Vibe2Spike, a novel battery-free, wireless sensing
framework that enables vibration-based activity recognition using visible light
communication (VLC) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). Our system uses
ultra-low-cost tags composed only of a piezoelectric disc, a Zener diode, and
an LED, which harvest vibration energy and emit sparse visible light spikes
without requiring batteries or RF radios. These optical spikes are captured by
event cameras and classified using optimized SNN models evolved via the EONS
framework. We evaluate Vibe2Spike across five device classes, achieving 94.9\%
average classification fitness while analyzing the latency-accuracy trade-offs
of different temporal binning strategies. Vibe2Spike demonstrates a scalable,
and energy-efficient approach for enabling intelligent environments in a
batteryless manner.

Motivation: 传统HRV分析受年龄相关自主神经变化的干扰，影响了通过睡眠HRV进行血糖预测的准确性

Method: 采用43名受试者的多模态数据，包括睡眠阶段特异心电图、HRV特征和临床测量。应用新的年龄正则化技术，使用贝叶斯岭回归进行5折交叉验证的对数血糖预测

Result: 年龄正则化HRV特徂实现R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182)，较非正则化特征提高25.6%。最佳预测特征包括快动眼动期HRV、深睡期HRV和舔张压

Conclusion: 年龄正则化HRV特征显著提高了血糖预测准确性，为非侵入性监测提供了可行方向，但需要在更大群体中验证

Abstract: Non-invasive glucose monitoring remains a critical challenge in the
management of diabetes. HRV during sleep shows promise for glucose prediction
however, age-related autonomic changes significantly confound traditional HRV
analyses. We analyzed 43 subjects with multi-modal data including sleep-stage
specific ECG, HRV features, and clinical measurements. A novel
age-normalization technique was applied to the HRV features by, dividing the
raw values by age-scaled factors. BayesianRidge regression with 5-fold
cross-validation was employed for log-glucose prediction. Age-normalized HRV
features achieved R2 = 0.161 (MAE = 0.182) for log-glucose prediction,
representing a 25.6% improvement over non-normalized features (R2 = 0.132). The
top predictive features were hrv rem mean rr age normalized (r = 0.443, p =
0.004), hrv ds mean rr age normalized (r = 0.438, p = 0.005), and diastolic
blood pressure (r = 0.437, p = 0.005). Systematic ablation studies confirmed
age-normalization as the critical component, with sleep-stage specific features
providing additional predictive value. Age-normalized HRV features
significantly enhance glucose prediction accuracy compared with traditional
approaches. This sleep-aware methodology addresses fundamental limitations in
autonomic function assessment and suggests a preliminary feasibility for
non-invasive glucose monitoring applications. However, these results require
validation in larger cohorts before clinical consideration.

Method: 使用108名被试的EEG数据集，系统评估传统分类器和深度神经网络在热痛和厌恶听觉刺激感知识别任务中的表现，比较within-participant和cross-participant两种评估设置下的性能差异。

Result: 传统模型在跨被试场景下性能下降最显著，深度学习模型表现出更好的稳健性，图神经网络模型在捕捉被试不变EEG信号结构方面展现出强大潜力，尽管性能变异仍然较高。

Abstract: EEG-based analysis of pain perception, enhanced by machine learning, reveals
how the brain encodes pain by identifying neural patterns evoked by noxious
stimulation. However, a major challenge that remains is the generalization of
machine learning models across individuals, given the high cross-participant
variability inherent to EEG signals and the limited focus on direct pain
perception identification in current research. In this study, we systematically
evaluate the performance of cross-participant generalization of a wide range of
models, including traditional classifiers and deep neural classifiers for
identifying the sensory modality of thermal pain and aversive auditory
stimulation from EEG recordings. Using a novel dataset of EEG recordings from
108 participants, we benchmark model performance under both within- and
cross-participant evaluation settings. Our findings show that traditional
models suffered the largest drop from within- to cross-participant performance,
while deep learning models proved more resilient, underscoring their potential
for subject-invariant EEG decoding. Even though performance variability
remained high, the strong results of the graph-based model highlight its
potential to capture subject-invariant structure in EEG signals. On the other
hand, we also share the preprocessed dataset used in this study, providing a
standardized benchmark for evaluating future algorithms under the same
generalization constraints.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了故障检测流程，提高了可靠性和可扩展性，符合ISO-17359标准要求

Abstract: The Point Machine (PM) is a critical piece of railway equipment that switches
train routes by diverting tracks through a switchblade. As with any critical
safety equipment, a failure will halt operations leading to service
disruptions; therefore, pre-emptive maintenance may avoid unnecessary
interruptions by detecting anomalies before they become failures. Previous work
relies on several inputs and crafting custom features by segmenting the signal.
This not only adds additional requirements for data collection and processing,
but it is also specific to the PM technology, the installed locations and
operational conditions limiting scalability. Based on the available maintenance
records, the main failure causes for PM are obstacles, friction, power source
issues and misalignment. Those failures affect the energy consumption pattern
of PMs, altering the usual (or healthy) shape of the power signal during the PM
movement. In contrast to the current state-of-the-art, our method requires only
one input. We apply a deep learning model to the power signal pattern to
classify if the PM is nominal or associated with any failure type, achieving
>99.99\% precision, <0.01\% false positives and negligible false negatives. Our
methodology is generic and technology-agnostic, proven to be scalable on
several electromechanical PM types deployed in both real-world and test bench
environments. Finally, by using conformal prediction the maintainer gets a
clear indication of the certainty of the system outputs, adding a confidence
layer to operations and making the method compliant with the ISO-17359
standard.

Abstract: Track Circuits (TC) are the main signalling devices used to detect the
presence of a train on a rail track. It has been used since the 19th century
and nowadays there are many types depending on the technology. As a general
classification, Track Circuits can be divided into 2 main groups, DC (Direct

particular AC track circuit, called "Smart Train Detection System" (STDS),

current data applied to an SVM (support vector machine) classifier as a type of
failure identifier. The main purpose of this work consists on determine
automatically which is the component of the track that is failing to improve
the maintenance action. Model was trained to classify 15 different failures
that belong to 3 more general categories. The method was tested with field data
from 10 different track circuits and validated by the STDS track circuit expert
and maintainers. All use cases were correctly classified by the method.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide,
accounting for over 30% of global deaths according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Importantly, one-third of these deaths are preventable with
timely and accurate diagnosis. The electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive
method for recording the electrical activity of the heart, is crucial for
diagnosing CVDs. However, privacy concerns surrounding the use of patient ECG
data in research have spurred interest in synthetic data, which preserves the
statistical properties of real data without compromising patient
confidentiality. This study explores the potential of synthetic ECG data for
training deep learning models from regression to classification tasks and
evaluates the feasibility of transfer learning to enhance classification
performance on real ECG data. We experimented with popular deep learning models
to predict four key cardiac parameters, namely, Heart Rate (HR), PR interval,
QT interval, and QRS complex-using separate regression models. Subsequently, we
leveraged these regression models for transfer learning to perform 5-class ECG
signal classification. Our experiments systematically investigate whether
transfer learning from regression to classification is viable, enabling better
utilization of diverse open-access and synthetic ECG datasets. Our findings
demonstrate that transfer learning from regression to classification improves
classification performance, highlighting its potential to maximize the utility
of available data and advance deep learning applications in this domain.

Abstract: Objective: Sparse Bayesian learning provides an effective scheme to solve the
high-dimensional problem in brain signal decoding. However, traditional
assumptions regarding data distributions such as Gaussian and binomial are
potentially inadequate to characterize the noisy signals of brain activity.
Hence, this study aims to propose a robust sparse Bayesian learning framework
to address noisy highdimensional brain activity decoding. Methods: Motivated by
the commendable robustness of the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion for
handling complex data distributions, we proposed an MEE-based likelihood
function to facilitate the accurate inference of sparse Bayesian learning in
analyzing noisy brain datasets. Results: Our proposed approach was evaluated
using two high-dimensional brain decoding tasks in regression and
classification contexts, respectively. The experimental results showed that,
our approach can realize superior decoding metrics and physiological patterns
than the conventional and state-of-the-art methods. Conclusion: Utilizing the
proposed MEE-based likelihood model, sparse Bayesian learning is empowered to
simultaneously address the challenges of noise and high dimensionality in the
brain decoding task. Significance: This work provides a powerful tool to
realize robust brain decoding, advancing biomedical engineering applications
such as brain-computer interface.

Abstract: Affective computing is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary research
direction in the field of brain-computer interface. In recent years, the
introduction of deep learning technology has greatly promoted the development
of the field of emotion recognition. However, due to physiological differences
between subjects, as well as the variations in experimental environments and
equipment, cross-corpus emotion recognition faces serious challenges,
especially for samples near the decision boundary. To solve the above problems,
we propose an optimization method based on domain adversarial transfer learning
to fine-grained alignment of affective features, named Maximum classifier
discrepancy with Pairwise Learning (McdPL) framework. In McdPL, we design a
dual adversarial classifier (Ada classifier and RMS classifier), and apply a
three-stage adversarial training to maximize classification discrepancy and
minimize feature distribution to align controversy samples near the decision
boundary. In the process of domain adversarial training, the two classifiers
also maintain an adversarial relationship, ultimately enabling precise
cross-corpus feature alignment. In addition, the introduction of pairwise
learning transforms the classification problem of samples into a similarity
problem between samples, alleviating the influence of label noise. We conducted
systematic experimental evaluation of the model using publicly available SEED,
SEED-IV and SEED-V databases. The results show that the McdPL model is superior
to other baseline models in the cross-corpus emotion recognition task, and the
average accuracy improvements of 4.76\% and 3.97\%, respectively. Our work
provides a promising solution for emotion recognition cross-corpus. The source

Abstract: Sleep stage classification is crucial for diagnosing and managing disorders
such as sleep apnea and insomnia. Conventional clinical methods like
polysomnography are costly and impractical for long-term home use. We present
an energy-efficient pipeline that detects four sleep stages (wake, REM, light,
and deep) from a single-lead ECG. Two windowing strategies are introduced: (1)
a 5-minute window with 30-second steps for machine-learning models that use
handcrafted features, and (2) a 30-second window with 10-second steps for
deep-learning models, enabling near-real-time 10-second resolution. Lightweight
networks such as MobileNet-v1 reach 92 percent accuracy and 91 percent F1-score
but still draw significant energy. We therefore design SleepLiteCNN, a custom
model that achieves 89 percent accuracy and 89 percent F1-score while lowering
energy use to 5.48 microjoules per inference at 45 nm. Applying eight-bit
quantization preserves accuracy and further reduces power, and FPGA deployment
confirms low resource usage. The proposed system offers a practical solution
for continuous, wearable ECG-based sleep monitoring.

Motivation: 单模态深度学习模型存在过拟合和沿射性局限性，而多模态融合策略在高风险临床应用中的最优方案仍不明确，特别是在ECG心血管疾病分类中。

Method: 采用ECG信号的三个域（时间、频率、时间-频率）进行中间融合（特征级）和后期融合（决策级）的对比实验，使用显著性地图进行可解释性分析，并通过互信息验证统计依赖性。

Result: 中间融合策略持续表现优于后期融合，达到最高97%的准确率，相比单模态模型Cohen's d > 0.8，相比后期融合d = 0.40。显著性地图与离散化ECG信号保持一致，互信息分析确认了统计依赖性。

Abstract: The limitations of unimodal deep learning models, particularly their tendency
to overfit and limited generalizability, have renewed interest in multimodal
fusion strategies. Multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN) have the capability
of integrating diverse data domains and offer a promising solution for robust
and accurate predictions. However, the optimal fusion strategy, intermediate
fusion (feature-level) versus late fusion (decision-level) remains
insufficiently examined, especially in high-stakes clinical contexts such as
ECG-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) classification. This study investigates
the comparative effectiveness of intermediate and late fusion strategies using
ECG signals across three domains: time, frequency, and time-frequency. A series
of experiments were conducted to identify the highest-performing fusion
architecture. Results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently
outperformed late fusion, achieving a peak accuracy of 97 percent, with Cohen's
d > 0.8 relative to standalone models and d = 0.40 compared to late fusion.
Interpretability analyses using saliency maps reveal that both models align
with the discretized ECG signals. Statistical dependency between the
discretized ECG signals and corresponding saliency maps for each class was
confirmed using Mutual Information (MI). The proposed ECG domain-based
multimodal model offers superior predictive capability and enhanced
explainability, crucial attributes in medical AI applications, surpassing
state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 这研究提出了一种新题的功能-能量拓扑模型，利用图神经网络从单通道EEG解码非自杀性自戒伤害的脑网络机制，发现了关键的反馈循环失调现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非自杀性自戒伤害(NSSI)的神经动力学机制，尝试通过理论驱动的图神经网络处理实际环境中收集的稀疏单通道EEG数据。

Method: 使用智能手机应用和便携式Fp1 EEG头带，从3名青少年NSSI患者收集了近1个月的EEG数据。构建了一个包含7个功能节点的理论驱动GNN模型，通过身体内和跨身体交叉验证评估性能，使用GNNExplainer进行可解释性分析。

Result: 模型达到了较高的身体内准确率(>85%)和显著超过随机水平的跨身体性能(约73.7%)。可解释性分析发现在NSSI状态下，调节体感的关键反馈循环出现功能障碍和方向性逆转，脑失去了通过负面身体反馈进行自我纠正的能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了理论引导的GNN模型在处理稀疏单通道EEG数据以解码复杂精神状态方面的可行性。识别出的"反馈循环逆转"机制为NSSI提供了一种新题、动态且可计算的机制模型，为寻找客观生物标记物和下一代数字疗法提供了基础。

Abstract: Objective: This study proposes and preliminarily validates a novel
"Functional-Energetic Topology Model" to uncover neurodynamic mechanisms of
Non-Suicidal Self-Injury (NSSI), using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to decode
brain network patterns from single-channel EEG in real-world settings.Methods:
EEG data were collected over ~1 month from three adolescents with NSSI using a
smartphone app and a portable Fp1 EEG headband during impulsive and
non-impulsive states. A theory-driven GNN with seven functional nodes was
built. Performance was evaluated via intra-subject (80/20 split) and
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV). GNNExplainer was used for
interpretability.Results: The model achieved high intra-subject accuracy (>85%)
and significantly above-chance cross-subject performance (approximately73.7%).
Explainability analysis revealed a key finding: during NSSI states, a critical
feedback loop regulating somatic sensation exhibits dysfunction and directional
reversal. Specifically, the brain loses its ability to self-correct via
negative bodily feedback, and the regulatory mechanism enters an "ineffective
idling" state.Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility of applying
theory-guided GNNs to sparse, single-channel EEG for decoding complex mental
states. The identified "feedback loop reversal" offers a novel, dynamic, and
computable model of NSSI mechanisms, paving the way for objective biomarkers
and next-generation Digital Therapeutics (DTx).

TL;DR: 机器学习预测铝合金在海洋环境中的腐负性能，高斯过程回归表现最优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铝合金在海洋环境中面临严重腐负挑战，需要快速预测和优化腐负阻力

Method: 使用开源数据集，采用两种方法：直接方法（根据材料组成和环境条件预测腐负速率）和逆向方法（根据腐负速率选择材料组成），比较了随机森林、神经网络和高斯过程回归三种机器学习方法

Result: 高斯过程回归表现最优，尤其是使用混合核函数时，对数变换后的GPR进一步提高了预测精度

Conclusion: 机器学习特别是高斯过程回归在预测铝合金腐负性能方面具有高效性，为材料设计和选择提供了新方法

Abstract: Corrosion poses a significant challenge to the performance of aluminum
alloys, particularly in marine environments. This study investigates the
application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict and optimize
corrosion resistance, utilizing a comprehensive open-source dataset compiled
from various sources. The dataset encompasses corrosion rate data and
environmental conditions, preprocessed to standardize units and formats. We
explored two different approaches, a direct approach, where the material's
composition and environmental conditions were used as inputs to predict
corrosion rates; and an inverse approach, where corrosion rate served as the
input to identify suitable material compositions as output. We employed and
compared three distinct ML methodologies for forward predictions: Random Forest
regression, optimized via grid search; a feed-forward neural network, utilizing
ReLU activation and Adam optimization; and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR),
implemented with GPyTorch and employing various kernel functions. The Random
Forest and neural network models provided predictive capabilities based on
elemental compositions and environmental conditions. Notably, Gaussian Process
Regression demonstrated superior performance, particularly with hybrid kernel
functions. Log-transformed GPR further refined predictions. This study
highlights the efficacy of ML, particularly GPR, in predicting corrosion rates
and material properties.

Abstract: As a critical component of Wearable AI, IMU-based Human Activity Recognition
(HAR) has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry in
recent years. Although HAR performance has improved considerably in specific
scenarios, its generalization capability remains a key barrier to widespread
real-world adoption. For example, domain shifts caused by variations in users,
sensor positions, or environments can significantly decrease the performance in
practice. As a result, in this survey, we explore the rapidly evolving field of
IMU-based generalizable HAR, reviewing 229 research papers alongside 25
publicly available datasets to provide a broad and insightful overview. We
first present the background and overall framework of IMU-based HAR tasks, as
well as the generalization-oriented training settings. Then, we categorize
representative methodologies from two perspectives: (i) model-centric
approaches, including pre-training method, end-to-end method, and large
language model (LLM)-based learning method; and (ii) data-centric approaches,
including multi-modal learning and data augmentation techniques. In addition,
we summarize widely used datasets in this field, as well as relevant tools and
benchmarks. Building on these methodological advances, the broad applicability
of IMU-based HAR is also reviewed and discussed. Finally, we discuss persistent
challenges (e.g., data scarcity, efficient training, and reliable evaluation)
and also outline future directions for HAR, including the adoption of
foundation and large language models, physics-informed and context-aware
reasoning, generative modeling, and resource-efficient training and inference.

Motivation: 虽然数据驱动的无线电频成像在地下目标检测方面展现了强大潜力，但在动态环境中实现准确和稳健的性能仍然面临挑战

Method: 设计了无线电频与视觉传感器的跨模态感知系统，采用跨模态学习方法训练RF成像深度神经网络模型，并在环境变化时通过持续学习自动更新模型

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法平均相当直径误差为2.29厘米，比当前最先进方法提高了23.2%

Conclusion: 该研究提出的DRIFT框架能够在动态环境中有效地重建地下根块藤的截面图像，为地下目标检测提供了一种准确和稳健的解决方案

Abstract: Data-driven radio frequency (RF) tomography has demonstrated significant
potential for underground target detection, due to the penetrative nature of RF
signals through soil. However, it is still challenging to achieve accurate and
robust performance in dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a
data-driven radio frequency tomography (DRIFT) framework with the following key
components to reconstruct cross section images of underground root tubers, even
with significant changes in RF signals. First, we design a cross-modal sensing
system with RF and visual sensors, and propose to train an RF tomography deep
neural network (DNN) model following the cross-modal learning approach. Then we
propose to apply continual learning to automatically update the DNN model, once
environment changes are detected in a dynamic environment. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves an average equivalent diameter error of 2.29
cm, 23.2% improvement upon the state-of-the-art approach. Our DRIFT code and
dataset are publicly available on https://github.com/Data-driven-RTI/DRIFT.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一种AI引导的测试生成方法，用于发现AI原生无线接收器模型的故障场景，相比传统网格搜索方法效率提高19%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI原生无线接收器缺乏可解释性，且无法进行穷尽测试，存在网络功能风险，需要有效的测试方法来发现潜在故障

Method: 使用基于梯度的优化方法在线生成测试用例，针对最可能失败的特定配置进行探测，避免穷举所有环境条件

Result: ATLAS发现了AI原生DeepRx接收器在特定移动性、信道延迟扩展和噪声组合下的性能问题，测试效率比网格搜索高19%

Conclusion: ATLAS提供了一种高效测试AI原生无线接收器的方法，解决了高维测试空间的可扩展性问题，为AI无线系统的可靠性评估提供了实用工具

Abstract: Industry adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native wireless receivers,
or even modular, Machine Learning (ML)-aided wireless signal processing blocks,
has been slow. The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained
ML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of
failures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible
and (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper
proposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for
pre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a
classical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids
spanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead,
it generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific
configurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and
validate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver
model as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's
Sionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel
delay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of
AI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our
proposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19%
compared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem,
demonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the
grid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making
it increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.

*Zhongqin Wang,J. Andrew Zhang,Kai Wu,Min Xu,Y. Jay Guo*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: WiDFS 3.0是一个轻量级双基地SISO感知框架，通过自参考互相关方法和延迟域波束成形技术，有效解决了单天线系统中的时钟异步相位偏移和多普勒镜像模糊问题，实现了准确的延迟和多普勒估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的集成感知与通信系统通常受限于低成本单天线收发器，时钟异步会在信道状态信息中引入随机相位偏移，而传统多天线方法无法在这种双基地SISO设置中缓解这一问题。

Method: 提出自参考互相关方法用于SISO随机相位去除，并采用延迟域波束成形技术来解决多普勒模糊问题，生成无模糊的延迟-多普勒-时间特征，使用紧凑神经网络进行鲁棒感知。

Result: WiDFS 3.0实现了准确的参数估计，性能可与甚至超越先前的多天线方法，特别是在延迟估计方面。在单目标和多目标场景下验证，提取的无模糊特征显示出强大的感知精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架仅需单天线收发器，适合低复杂度部署，在嵌入式友好的MobileViT-XXS上仅使用130万参数就能持续优于传统特征方法，为低成本ISAC系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for
next-generation wireless systems. However, real-world deployment is often
limited to low-cost, single-antenna transceivers. In such bistatic Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) setup, clock asynchrony introduces random phase offsets in
Channel State Information (CSI), which cannot be mitigated using conventional
multi-antenna methods. This work proposes WiDFS 3.0, a lightweight bistatic
SISO sensing framework that enables accurate delay and Doppler estimation from
distorted CSI by effectively suppressing Doppler mirroring ambiguity. It
operates with only a single antenna at both the transmitter and receiver,
making it suitable for low-complexity deployments. We propose a
self-referencing cross-correlation (SRCC) method for SISO random phase removal
and employ delay-domain beamforming to resolve Doppler ambiguity. The resulting
unambiguous delay-Doppler-time features enable robust sensing with compact
neural networks. Extensive experiments show that WiDFS 3.0 achieves accurate
parameter estimation, with performance comparable to or even surpassing that of
prior multi-antenna methods, especially in delay estimation. Validated under
single- and multi-target scenarios, the extracted ambiguity-resolved features
show strong sensing accuracy and generalization. For example, when deployed on
the embedded-friendly MobileViT-XXS with only 1.3M parameters, WiDFS 3.0
consistently outperforms conventional features such as CSI amplitude, mirrored
Doppler, and multi-receiver aggregated Doppler.

Motivation: 解决多机器人臂等智能体在受限环境中协调运动的根本挑战，避免碰撞并最小化动作次数。

Method: 提出k-兼容排序问题框架，使用图约束建模状态转换，分析不同情况下的计算复杂度并设计相应算法。

Result: 证明k-兼容排序问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但在k=1或约束图有界树宽等特殊情况下存在多项式时间算法。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于调度、重配置和运动规划等领域，为约束环境中的多智能体协调提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: Coordinating the motion of multiple agents in constrained environments is a
fundamental challenge in robotics, motion planning, and scheduling. A
motivating example involves $n$ robotic arms, each represented as a line
segment. The objective is to rotate each arm to its vertical orientation, one
at a time (clockwise or counterclockwise), without collisions nor rotating any
arm more than once. This scenario is an example of the more general
$k$-Compatible Ordering problem, where $n$ agents, each capable of $k$
state-changing actions, must transition to specific target states under
constraints encoded as a set $\mathcal{G}$ of $k$ pairs of directed graphs.
  We show that $k$-Compatible Ordering is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete, even when
$\mathcal{G}$ is planar, degenerate, or acyclic. On the positive side, we
provide polynomial-time algorithms for cases such as when $k = 1$ or
$\mathcal{G}$ has bounded treewidth. We also introduce generalized variants
supporting multiple state-changing actions per agent, broadening the
applicability of our framework. These results extend to a wide range of
scheduling, reconfiguration, and motion planning applications in constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全局化策略容易漏掉具体查询中的假负样本，影响训练效果和检索性能。

Method: 设计了一个可学习的适配器模块，监测Bi-Encoder表示来动态估计硬负样本为假负样本的概率，并将这些预测分数用于重新采样和重新排序。

Result: 在标准测试集上，该方法一贯地超越了强劲的Bi-Encoder基线模型。

Conclusion: 显式地模型假负样本能够显著提升密集检索的性能。

Abstract: In dense retrieval, effective training hinges on selecting high quality hard
negatives while avoiding false negatives. Recent methods apply heuristics based
on positive document scores to identify hard negatives, improving both
performance and interpretability. However, these global, example agnostic
strategies often miss instance specific false negatives. To address this, we
propose a learnable adapter module that monitors Bi-Encoder representations to
estimate the likelihood that a hard negative is actually a false negative. This
probability is modeled dynamically and contextually, enabling fine-grained,
query specific judgments. The predicted scores are used in two downstream
components: (1) resampling, where negatives are reweighted during training, and
(2) reranking, where top-k retrieved documents are reordered at inference.
Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that our adapter-enhanced
framework consistently outperforms strong Bi-Encoder baselines, underscoring
the benefit of explicit false negative modeling in dense retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在推荐系统中存在检索优化限制，主要因为自回归生成机制导致的顺序依赖问题，无法高效生成无位置约束的多项目。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多会话序列（会话token+项目token），采用有限历史数据预训练和随机部分增量训练，强调数据时效性而非数据量。

Result: 在公开基准和淘宝大规模工业数据集上的实验表明，TBGRecall优于最先进的推荐方法，并展现出明显的缩放定律趋势。

Conclusion: NSP代表了生成式推荐系统在电商应用效果方面的重大进步，解决了传统方法的效率限制问题。

Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential tools in modern e-commerce, facilitating
personalized user experiences by suggesting relevant products. Recent
advancements in generative models have demonstrated potential in enhancing
recommendation systems; however, these models often exhibit limitations in
optimizing retrieval tasks, primarily due to their reliance on autoregressive
generation mechanisms. Conventional approaches introduce sequential
dependencies that impede efficient retrieval, as they are inherently unsuitable
for generating multiple items without positional constraints within a single
request session. To address these limitations, we propose TBGRecall, a
framework integrating Next Session Prediction (NSP), designed to enhance
generative retrieval models for e-commerce applications. Our framework
reformulation involves partitioning input samples into multi-session sequences,
where each sequence comprises a session token followed by a set of item tokens,
and then further incorporate multiple optimizations tailored to the generative
task in retrieval scenarios. In terms of training methodology, our pipeline
integrates limited historical data pre-training with stochastic partial
incremental training, significantly improving training efficiency and
emphasizing the superiority of data recency over sheer data volume. Our
extensive experiments, conducted on public benchmarks alongside a large-scale
industrial dataset from TaoBao, show TBGRecall outperforms the state-of-the-art
recommendation methods, and exhibits a clear scaling law trend. Ultimately, NSP
represents a significant advancement in the effectiveness of generative
recommendation systems for e-commerce applications.

Abstract: Effective Question Answering (QA) on large biomedical document collections
requires effective document retrieval techniques. The latter remains a
challenging task due to the domain-specific vocabulary and semantic ambiguity
in user queries. We propose BMQExpander, a novel ontology-aware query expansion
pipeline that combines medical knowledge - definitions and relationships - from
the UMLS Metathesaurus with the generative capabilities of large language

state-of-the-art baselines, including sparse and dense retrievers, query
expansion methods, and biomedical-specific solutions. We show that BMQExpander
has superior retrieval performance on three popular biomedical Information
Retrieval (IR) benchmarks: NFCorpus, TREC-COVID, and SciFact - with
improvements of up to 22.1% in NDCG@10 over sparse baselines and up to 6.5%
over the strongest baseline. Further, BMQExpander generalizes robustly under
query perturbation settings, in contrast to supervised baselines, achieving up
to 15.7% improvement over the strongest baseline. As a side contribution, we
publish our paraphrased benchmarks. Finally, our qualitative analysis shows
that BMQExpander has fewer hallucinations compared to other LLM-based query
expansion baselines.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of hyperbolic geometry for
capturing complex patterns from interaction data in recommender systems. In
this work, we introduce a novel hyperbolic recommendation model that uses
geometrical insights to improve representation learning and increase
computational stability at the same time. We reformulate the notion of
hyperbolic distances to unlock additional representation capacity over
conventional Euclidean space and learn more expressive user and item
representations. To better capture user-items interactions, we construct a
triplet loss that models ternary relations between users and their
corresponding preferred and nonpreferred choices through a mix of pairwise
interaction terms driven by the geometry of data. Our hyperbolic approach not
only outperforms existing Euclidean and hyperbolic models but also reduces
popularity bias, leading to more diverse and personalized recommendations.

Motivation: 现有的联邦在线学习排序基准存在局限性，主要基于随机划分的经典数据集、模拟点击和同步客户端参与的假设，无法真实反映现实世界动态。

Method: 构建包含用户标识符、真实点击数据和查询时间戳的大规模数据集，支持真实的用户划分、行为建模和异步联邦学习场景。

Result: 创建了包含2.6百万查询和10,000用户的AOL4FOLTR数据集，解决了现有基准的关键限制。

Conclusion: AOL4FOLTR数据集为联邦在线学习排序提供了更真实的基准，能够更好地模拟现实世界应用场景。

Abstract: The centralized collection of search interaction logs for training ranking
models raises significant privacy concerns. Federated Online Learning to Rank
(FOLTR) offers a privacy-preserving alternative by enabling collaborative model
training without sharing raw user data. However, benchmarks in FOLTR are
largely based on random partitioning of classical learning-to-rank datasets,
simulated user clicks, and the assumption of synchronous client participation.
This oversimplifies real-world dynamics and undermines the realism of
experimental results. We present AOL4FOLTR, a large-scale web search dataset
with 2.6 million queries from 10,000 users. Our dataset addresses key
limitations of existing benchmarks by including user identifiers, real click
data, and query timestamps, enabling realistic user partitioning, behavior
modeling, and asynchronous federated learning scenarios.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的不对称潜在特征空间扩散推荐模型(AsymDiffRec)，通过在离散数据空间中使用不对称的前向和反向过程，有效保留了个性化信息，在实际应用中获得了显著的效果收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为推荐系统的样本处于离散数据空间，与连续空间有本质区别。标准高斯噪声可能会破坏潜在表征中的个性化信息，需要一种更适合离散数据空间的扩散方法。

Method: 提出AsymDiffRec模型，在不对称潜在特征空间中进行前向和反向过程。前向过程模拟真实推荐样本中的缺失特征，反向过程在不对称空间进行。使用任务导向的优化策略保留个性化信息。

Result: 在斜音音乐App中进行的在线A/B测试显示，用户活跃天数提升+0.131%，App使用时长提升+0.166%。离线实验也证明了收益。

Conclusion: AsymDiffRec通过在离散数据空间中使用不对称扩散过程，有效解决了标准扩散模型在推荐系统中的不匹配问题，能够生成更稳健和减噪的表征进行最终预测，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the
diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in
recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically
utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in
continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation
systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from
the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt
personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we
propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation
Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an
asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the
missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is
then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized
information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization
strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing
features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust
representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with
AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and
+0.166% in terms of users' active days and app usage duration respectively.
Additionally, the extended offline experiments also demonstrate improvements.

*Seongeun Ryu,Yunyong Ko,Sang-Wook Kim*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: LIME是一个新颖的新闻推荐框架，通过用户-主题生命周期感知的年龄表示、候选感知的生命周期注意力机制和新鲜度引导的兴趣细化，有效解决了时间相关挑战，显著提升了推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻推荐方法在利用点击新闻的年龄推断用户兴趣持久性和建模新闻生命周期变化方面存在不足，需要解决这两个时间相关挑战。

Method: 提出LIME框架，包含三个核心策略：用户-主题生命周期感知的年龄表示、候选感知的生命周期注意力机制、新鲜度引导的兴趣细化。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，LIME持续优于多种最先进的新闻推荐方法，其模型无关策略显著提高了推荐准确性。

Conclusion: LIME框架成功解决了新闻推荐中的时间相关挑战，通过生命周期感知的方法实现了更好的兴趣匹配和推荐效果。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendation aims to deliver news articles aligned with
users' interests, serving as a key solution to alleviate the problem of
information overload on online news platforms. While prior work has improved
interest matching through refined representations of news and users, the
following time-related challenges remain underexplored: (C1) leveraging the age
of clicked news to infer users' interest persistence, and (C2) modeling the
varying lifetime of news across topics and users. To jointly address these
challenges, we propose a novel Lifetime-aware Interest Matching framework for
nEws recommendation, named LIME, which incorporates three key strategies: (1)
User-Topic lifetime-aware age representation to capture the relative age of
news with respect to a user-topic pair, (2) Candidate-aware lifetime attention
for generating temporally aligned user representation, and (3) Freshness-guided
interest refinement for prioritizing valid candidate news at prediction time.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that LIME
consistently outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art news recommendation
methods, and its model agnostic strategies significantly improve recommendation
accuracy.

*Xinkui Zhao,Yifan Zhang,Zhengyi Zhou,Yueshen Xu*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: StackPilot是一个LLM原生的多智能体框架，用于语言无关的代码验证和执行，无需依赖传统工具链，在可靠性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的代码验证和执行仍然面临重大挑战，传统方法依赖语言特定的编译器和环境相关的运行时，存在局限性。

Method: 采用Function-as-Agents范式将每个函数建模为自主智能体，使用LLM-as-Executor策略进行基于堆栈的调度验证，并引入快照机制保存完整执行上下文。

Result: 实证评估显示StackPilot实现了89%到97%的框架可靠性率，显著优于基线方法，能够可靠验证和执行更多LLM生成的代码。

Conclusion: StackPilot框架能够有效解决LLM生成代码的验证和执行问题，在跨编程任务的代码验证方面表现出色，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have substantially enhanced
automated code generation across a wide range of programming languages.
Nonetheless, verifying the correctness and executability of LLM-generated code
remains a significant challenge, as traditional methods rely on
language-specific compilers and environment-dependent runtimes. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce StackPilot, an LLM-native, multi-agent
framework designed for language-agnostic code verification and execution, which
operates independently of conventional toolchains. StackPilot offers three
principal innovations: (1) a Function-as-Agents paradigm, in which each
function is modeled as an autonomous agent capable of fine-grained reasoning
and collaborative verification; (2) an LLM-as-Executor strategy, which enables
scalable verification via stack-based scheduling; and (3) a novel snapshot
mechanism that preserves complete execution contexts, facilitating
deterministic and lossless context switching during verification. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that StackPilot achieves framework reliability rates
between 89% and 97%, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. These
results indicate that StackPilot can reliably verify and execute a
significantly larger proportion of LLM-generated code across diverse
programming tasks compared to existing methods.

*Dmitry Belousov,Yury Yanovich*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的NFT稀有度评估方法DIT，通过降维技术和交易差异性度量，在ROAR基准测试中优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NFT稀有度评估存在标准化挑战，现有稀有度计量器难以直接比较，需要统一的评估框架

Method: 采用非度量加权多维尺度分析进行最优稀有度计量器设计，引入基于降维技术的交易差异性(DIT)性能度量

Result: 开发的DIT稀有度计量器在ROAR基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能

Conclusion: 提出的降维方法和DIT度量为NFT稀有度评估提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become a significant digital asset class,
each uniquely representing virtual entities such as artworks. These tokens are
stored in collections within smart contracts and are actively traded across
platforms on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana blockchains. The value of NFTs is
closely tied to their distinctive characteristics that define rarity, leading
to a growing interest in quantifying rarity within both industry and academia.
While there are existing rarity meters for assessing NFT rarity, comparing them
can be challenging without direct access to the underlying collection data. The
Rating over all Rarities (ROAR) benchmark addresses this challenge by providing
a standardized framework for evaluating NFT rarity. This paper explores a
dimension reduction approach to rarity design, introducing new performance
measures and meters, and evaluates them using the ROAR benchmark. Our
contributions to the rarity meter design issue include developing an optimal
rarity meter design using non-metric weighted multidimensional scaling,
introducing Dissimilarity in Trades (DIT) as a performance measure inspired by
dimension reduction techniques, and unveiling the non-interpretable rarity
meter DIT, which demonstrates superior performance compared to existing
methods.

*Bin Ma,Yifei Zhang,Yongjin Xian,Qi Li,Linna Zhou,Gongxun Miao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的谣言检测模型Insight Rumors，能够在文本中定位和标记具体的谣言内容，而不仅仅是类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的谣言检测模型主要关注如何将文本分类为谣言或非谣言，缺乏定位和标记具体谣言内容的能力。

Method: 提出了Att_BiMamba2网络（双向Mamba2模型加点积注意力）来增强高维谣言特征表示，设计了谣言定位标记模块（跳连网络加条件随机场CRF）来将高维特征投影到低维标签空间，并构建了标注数据集。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够精确定位和标记谣言内容的新型模型，充分利用了双向Mamba2网络和CRF条件约束，为谣言检测领域提供了更精细化的解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of social media networks, rumor detection models have
attracted more and more attention. Whereas, these models primarily focus on
classifying contexts as rumors or not, lacking the capability to locate and
mark specific rumor content. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a
novel rumor detection model named Insight Rumors to locate and mark rumor
content within textual data. Specifically, we propose the Bidirectional Mamba2
Network with Dot-Product Attention (Att_BiMamba2), a network that constructs a
bidirectional Mamba2 model and applies dot-product attention to weight and
combine the outputs from both directions, thereby enhancing the representation
of high-dimensional rumor features. Simultaneously, a Rumor Locating and
Marking module is designed to locate and mark rumors. The module constructs a
skip-connection network to project high-dimensional rumor features onto
low-dimensional label features. Moreover, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is
employed to impose strong constraints on the output label features, ensuring
accurate rumor content location. Additionally, a labeled dataset for rumor
locating and marking is constructed, with the effectiveness of the proposed
model is evaluated through comprehensive experiments. Extensive experiments
indicate that the proposed scheme not only detects rumors accurately but also
locates and marks them in context precisely, outperforming state-of-the-art
schemes that can only discriminate rumors roughly.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本文针对随机K-out图网络模型，提出了在有限节点和不可靠环境下保证可靠连通性的理论方法，包括连通概率的上下界分析、r-鲁棒性分析以及对抗节点对连通性的影响建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在分布式系统中，需要在保证网络稀疏性的同时实现可靠连通性。随机K-out图作为平衡连通性和稀疏性的启发式模型被广泛应用，但现有研究缺乏针对有限节点和对抗环境的参数选择指导。

Method: 1) 推导有限节点情况下随机K-out图连通概率的上下界；2) 分析r-鲁棒性属性（比连通性更强的概念）；3) 建模和分析对抗节点（以删除形式建模）对连通性和巨型组件大小的影响。

Result: 提出了保证网络可靠连通性的理论框架，为网络参数选择提供了数学依据，特别是在有限节点和存在恶意节点的对抗环境下。

Conclusion: 研究成果为在网络中进行可靠推断的一系列算法提供了端到端的性能保证，特别是在隐私保护数据聚合等需要有限信任的场景中。

Abstract: In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion
is ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges,
while achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead
remains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and
inference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class
of network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to
balance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust,
e.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are
deployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network
parameters in response to different operational requirements, including the
need to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic
and adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to
inform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in
regimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and
lower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the
number of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a
stronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the
presence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based
on pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial
nodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics
that are closely tied to privacy guarantees. Together, our results pave the way
for end-to-end performance guarantees for a suite of algorithms for reliable
inference on networks.

Method: 构建AdProd-100K大规模数据集，采用双重数据增强策略培养稳健的3D感知表征；提出RefAdGen框架，通过在U-Net输入注入产品掩码实现精确空间控制，使用高效关注融合模块集成产品特征

Result: 实验结果显示RefAdGen达到了最先进的性能，在未见过的产品和具有挑战性的真实场景图像上都能保持高保真度和显著的视觉效果，展现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: RefAdGen为传统工作流程提供了一种可扩展、成本效益高的替代方案，有效解决了AIGC在广告图片生成中的保真度与效率两难问题

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)
techniques has unlocked opportunities in generating diverse and compelling
advertising images based on referenced product images and textual scene
descriptions. This capability substantially reduces human labor and production
costs in traditional marketing workflows. However, existing AIGC techniques
either demand extensive fine-tuning for each referenced image to achieve high
fidelity, or they struggle to maintain fidelity across diverse products, making
them impractical for e-commerce and marketing industries. To tackle this
limitation, we first construct AdProd-100K, a large-scale advertising image
generation dataset. A key innovation in its construction is our dual data
augmentation strategy, which fosters robust, 3D-aware representations crucial
for realistic and high-fidelity image synthesis. Leveraging this dataset, we
propose RefAdGen, a generation framework that achieves high fidelity through a
decoupled design. The framework enforces precise spatial control by injecting a
product mask at the U-Net input, and employs an efficient Attention Fusion
Module (AFM) to integrate product features. This design effectively resolves
the fidelity-efficiency dilemma present in existing methods. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RefAdGen achieves state-of-the-art performance,
showcasing robust generalization by maintaining high fidelity and remarkable
visual results for both unseen products and challenging real-world, in-the-wild
images. This offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional
workflows. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression generation from natural language is a crucial task
in Computer Graphics, with applications in Animation, Virtual Avatars, and
Human-Computer Interaction. However, current generative models suffer from
datasets that are either speech-driven or limited to coarse emotion labels,
lacking the nuanced, expressive descriptions needed for fine-grained control,
and were captured using elaborate and expensive equipment. We hence present a
new dataset of facial motion sequences featuring nuanced performances and
semantic annotation. The data is easily collected using commodity equipment and
LLM-generated natural language instructions, in the popular ARKit blendshape
format. This provides riggable motion, rich with expressive performances and
labels. We accordingly train two baseline models, and evaluate their
performance for future benchmarking. Using our Express4D dataset, the trained
models can learn meaningful text-to-expression motion generation and capture
the many-to-many mapping of the two modalities. The dataset, code, and video
examples are available on our webpage: https://jaron1990.github.io/Express4D/

TL;DR: MixCache是一个无需训练的高效视频DiT推理框架，通过多粒度缓存策略在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频DiT模型虽然能生成高质量视频，但多步迭代去噪过程计算成本高、推理延迟大。现有缓存方法仅限于单粒度策略，难以灵活平衡生成质量和推理速度

Method: 提出MixCache框架：1）区分不同缓存策略的干扰和边界；2）引入上下文感知缓存触发策略确定何时启用缓存；3）自适应混合缓存决策策略动态选择最优缓存粒度

Result: 在多种模型上的实验表明，MixCache能显著加速视频生成（如Wan 14B上1.94倍加速，HunyuanVideo上1.97倍加速），同时提供优于基线方法的生成质量和推理效率

Conclusion: MixCache通过创新的多粒度缓存策略，有效解决了视频DiT模型推理效率问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著的加速效果

Abstract: Leveraging the Transformer architecture and the diffusion process, video DiT
models have emerged as a dominant approach for high-quality video generation.
However, their multi-step iterative denoising process incurs high computational
cost and inference latency. Caching, a widely adopted optimization method in
DiT models, leverages the redundancy in the diffusion process to skip
computations in different granularities (e.g., step, cfg, block). Nevertheless,
existing caching methods are limited to single-granularity strategies,
struggling to balance generation quality and inference speed in a flexible
manner. In this work, we propose MixCache, a training-free caching-based
framework for efficient video DiT inference. It first distinguishes the
interference and boundary between different caching strategies, and then
introduces a context-aware cache triggering strategy to determine when caching
should be enabled, along with an adaptive hybrid cache decision strategy for
dynamically selecting the optimal caching granularity. Extensive experiments on
diverse models demonstrate that, MixCache can significantly accelerate video
generation (e.g., 1.94$\times$ speedup on Wan 14B, 1.97$\times$ speedup on
HunyuanVideo) while delivering both superior generation quality and inference
efficiency compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: We explore the performance of several state-of-the-art automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models on a large-scale Arabic speech dataset, the SADA
(Saudi Audio Dataset for Arabic), which contains 668 hours of high-quality
audio from Saudi television shows. The dataset includes multiple dialects and
environments, specifically a noisy subset that makes it particularly
challenging for ASR. We evaluate the performance of the models on the SADA test
set, and we explore the impact of fine-tuning, language models, as well as
noise and denoising on their performance. We find that the best performing
model is the MMS 1B model finetuned on SADA with a 4-gram language model that
achieves a WER of 40.9\% and a CER of 17.6\% on the SADA test clean set.

Conclusion: 本研究首次为单元元感知建立了拟合框架，为该技术及其下游应用开启了新方向

Abstract: Single-photon sensing has generated great interest as a prominent technique
of long-distance and ultra-sensitive imaging, however, it tends to yield sparse
and spatially biased point clouds, thus limiting its practical utility. In this
work, we propose using point upsampling networks to increase point density and
reduce spatial distortion in single-photon point cloud. Particularly, our
network is built on the state space model which integrates a multi-path
scanning mechanism to enrich spatial context, a bidirectional Mamba backbone to
capture global geometry and local details, and an adaptive upsample shift
module to correct offset-induced distortions. Extensive experiments are
implemented on commonly-used datasets to confirm its high reconstruction
accuracy and strong robustness to the distortion noise, and also on real-world
data to demonstrate that our model is able to generate visually consistent,
detail-preserving, and noise suppressed point clouds. Our work is the first to
establish the upsampling framework for single-photon sensing, and hence opens a
new avenue for single-photon sensing and its practical applications in the
downstreaming tasks.

Motivation: 可编程结构在软体机器人、航空航天可展开系统等领域有重要应用，但传统的逆向设计方法难以处理大非线性变形问题，需要开发高效的设计框架

Method: 使用DDPMs将逆向设计构建为条件生成任务，建立预处理和后处理管道，将构型表示为图像，通过几何描述符控制目标变形状态

Conclusion: 该生成式设计框架为压力驱动大变形结构的逆向设计提供了有效解决方案，能够高效处理复杂的非线性变形问题

Abstract: Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material
property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed
configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a
prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear
deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable
aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a
generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,
nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates
the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric
descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based
representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these
configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and
postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation
setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and
higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce
diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when
inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while
accommodating complex constraints.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) read neural signals directly from the brain
to infer motor planning and execution. However, the implementation of this
technology has been largely limited to laboratory settings, with few real-world
applications. We developed a bimanual BCI system to drive a vehicle in both
simulated and real-world environments. We demonstrate that an individual with
tetraplegia, implanted with intracortical BCI electrodes in the posterior
parietal cortex (PPC) and the hand knob region of the motor cortex (MC), reacts
at least as fast and precisely as motor intact participants, and drives a
simulated vehicle as proficiently as the same control group. This BCI
participant, living in California, could also remotely drive a Ford Mustang
Mach-E vehicle in Michigan. Our first teledriving task relied on cursor control
for speed and steering in a closed urban test facility. However, the final BCI
system added click control for full-stop braking and thus enabled bimanual
cursor-and-click control for both simulated driving through a virtual town with
traffic and teledriving through an obstacle course without traffic in the real
world. We also demonstrate the safety and feasibility of BCI-controlled
driving. This first-of-its-kind implantable BCI application not only highlights
the versatility and innovative potentials of BCIs but also illuminates the
promising future for the development of life-changing solutions to restore
independence to those who suffer catastrophic neurological injury.

Conclusion: 该层次框架保持了标准黑盒BO的次线性悔弊保证，同时支持多任务和转移学习，为控制器参数学习提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Many control problems require repeated tuning and adaptation of controllers
across distinct closed-loop tasks, where data efficiency and adaptability are
critical. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that
is tailored to efficient controller parameter learning in sequential
decision-making and control scenarios for distinct tasks. Instead of treating
the closed-loop cost as a black-box, our method exploits structural knowledge
of the underlying problem, consisting of a dynamical system, a control law, and
an associated closed-loop cost function. We construct a hierarchical surrogate
model using Gaussian processes that capture the closed-loop state evolution
under different parameterizations, while the task-specific weighting and
accumulation into the closed-loop cost are computed exactly via known
closed-form expressions. This allows knowledge transfer and enhanced data
efficiency between different closed-loop tasks. The proposed framework retains
sublinear regret guarantees on par with standard black-box BO, while enabling
multi-task or transfer learning. Simulation experiments with model predictive
control demonstrate substantial benefits in both sample efficiency and
adaptability when compared to purely black-box BO approaches.

Motivation: 在封闭私有环境中，AprilTags的身份安全问题不大，因为所有标签都可以完全管控。但在开放公共环境中，身份安全成为不可忽视的问题，需要应对对抗性攻击可能造成的危害。

Method: 提倡使用可调节的AprilTags，而不是固定的标签。

Result: 通过使用可调节的AprilTags，能够更好地处理对抗性攻击带来的潜在危害。

Conclusion: 在开放公共环境中，应采用可调节的AprilTags来增强身份安全性，防范对抗性攻击。

Abstract: Special tags such as AprilTags that facilitate image processing and pattern
recognition are useful in practical applications. In close and private
environments, identity security is unlikely to be an issue because all involved
AprilTags can be completely regulated. However, in open and public
environments, identity security is no longer an issue that can be neglected. To
handle potential harm caused by adversarial attacks, this note advocates
utilization of adjustable AprilTags instead of fixed ones.

### [573] [Code Vulnerability Detection Across Different Programming Languages with AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11710)
*Hael Abdulhakim Ali Humran,Ferdi Sonmez*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了使用转换器模型（CodeBERT和CodeLlama）检测多编程语言代码的安全漏洞，通过细调和集成学习提高了检测精度，准确率超过97%，但仍面临偏差率和可解释性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于规则的静态分析工具在检测上下文依赖性漏洞时效果不佳且偏差率高，需要更有效的AI方案来提高代码安全检测的准确性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用转换器模型（CodeBERT、CodeLlama），经过数据集收集、语言规范化、模型细调、集成学习和可解释AI等步骤，构建了一套动态细调的漏洞检测方法。

Result: 实验结果显示细调后的CodeBERT模型准确率超过97%，在某些情况下甚至超过传统静态分析工具，但偏差率仍有下降空间，混合模型和验证流程能够有效降低偏差率。

Conclusion: AI基于的漏洞检测方案在多编程语言和漏洞类型上都显示了良好的通用性，为提高代码安全检测的可靠性和可扩展性提供了潜力，但在稳健性、可解释性和部署准备度方面仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Security vulnerabilities present in a code that has been written in diverse
programming languages are among the most critical yet complicated aspects of
source code to detect. Static analysis tools based on rule-based patterns
usually do not work well at detecting the context-dependent bugs and lead to
high false positive rates. Recent developments in artificial intelligence,
specifically the use of transformer-based models like CodeBERT and CodeLlama,
provide light to this problem, as they show potential in finding such flaws
better. This paper presents the implementations of these models on various
datasets of code vulnerability, showing how off-the-shelf models can
successfully produce predictive capacity in models through dynamic fine-tuning
of the models on vulnerable and safe code fragments. The methodology comprises
the gathering of the dataset, normalization of the language, fine-tuning of the
model, and incorporation of ensemble learning and explainable AI. Experiments
show that a well-trained CodeBERT can be as good as or even better than some
existing static analyzers in terms of accuracy greater than 97%. Further study
has indicated that although language models can achieve close-to-perfect
recall, the precision can decrease. A solution to this is given by hybrid
models and validation procedures, which will reduce false positives. According
to the results, the AI-based solutions generalize to different programming
languages and classes of vulnerability. Nevertheless, robustness,
interpretability, and deployment readiness are still being developed. The
results illustrate the probabilities that AI will enhance the trustworthiness
in the usability and scalability of machine-learning-based detectors of
vulnerabilities.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于AI的实时检测恶意GraphQL查询的方法，结合静态分析和机器学习技术，能够有效防范GraphQL API的安全漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphQL的灵活性带来了独特的安全漏洞，传统API安全机制无法有效应对。恶意查询可能导致拒绝服务攻击、数据泄漏等风险。

Method: 结合静态分析与机器学习技术，包括大语言模型(LLM)用于动态模式配置，Sentence Transformers用于查询负载的上下文嵌入，以及CNN、随机森林、多层感知机等分类器。优化生产环境部署策略。

Result: 高准确度检测各种威胁，包括SQL注入、OS命令注入、XSS漏洞等，同时有效减缓DoS和SSRF攻击。系统在负载下表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种健壮且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了GraphQL API的安全性能。

Abstract: GraphQL's flexibility, while beneficial for efficient data fetching,
introduces unique security vulnerabilities that traditional API security
mechanisms often fail to address. Malicious GraphQL queries can exploit the
language's dynamic nature, leading to denial-of-service attacks, data
exfiltration through injection, and other exploits. Existing solutions, such as
static analysis, rate limiting, and general-purpose Web Application Firewalls,
offer limited protection against sophisticated, context-aware attacks. This
paper presents a novel, AI-driven approach for real-time detection of malicious
GraphQL queries. Our method combines static analysis with machine learning
techniques, including Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic schema-based
configuration, Sentence Transformers (SBERT and Doc2Vec) for contextual
embedding of query payloads, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Random
Forests, and Multilayer Perceptrons for classification. We detail the system
architecture, implementation strategies optimized for production environments
(including ONNX Runtime optimization and parallel processing), and evaluate the
performance of our detection models and the overall system under load. Results
demonstrate high accuracy in detecting various threats, including SQL
injection, OS command injection, and XSS exploits, alongside effective
mitigation of DoS and SSRF attempts. This research contributes a robust and
adaptable solution for enhancing GraphQL API security.

Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming
increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of
submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service
platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the
requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an
individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable.
However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can
surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and
synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an
ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable
from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are
faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train
fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is
originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept
private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government,
police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and
discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection
research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over
900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using
different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In
addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite.
3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We
release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic
attacks from popular databases in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检测LLM生成的代码需要能够在高度结构化、语法约束环境中工作的水印系统

Method: 使用强化学习训练范式，采用策略驱动方法通过参数化模型智能偏置token选择，结合执行反馈和水印嵌入信号的奖励系统，使用Gumbel Top-k重参数化进行离散水印决策的梯度优化

Result: 在比较评估中，CodeTracer在水印可检测性和生成代码功能保持方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: CodeTracer提供了一个有效的代码水印解决方案，能够在保持代码质量的同时实现可靠的水印检测

Abstract: The need for detecting LLM-generated code necessitates watermarking systems
capable of operating within its highly structured and syntactically constrained
environment. To address this, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive
code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning
training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach
that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during
next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain
code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable
deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we
devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution
feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and
outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization
to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions.
Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant
superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and
the preservation of generated code's functionality.

### [577] [Mitigating Jailbreaks with Intent-Aware LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12072)
*Wei Jie Yeo,Ranjan Satapathy,Erik Cambria*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Intent-FT是一种简单轻量的微调方法，通过训练LLM在响应前推断指令的潜在意图，显著提高了对对抗性攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持模型的一般能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进行了广泛的安全调优，大型语言模型仍然容易受到通过对抗性指令进行的越狱攻击，这反映了安全性和任务性能之间的持续权衡。

Method: 提出Intent-FT方法，在针对性的对抗指令集上进行微调，使LLM能够在响应前推断指令的底层意图，从而泛化到未见过的攻击。

Result: Intent-FT持续缓解了所有评估的攻击类别，没有单一攻击成功率超过50%，而现有防御方法仅部分有效。该方法保持了模型的通用能力，并减少了良性指令的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: Intent-FT是一种有效的防御方法，能够准确识别对抗攻击中的隐藏有害意图，并且这些学习到的意图可以有效地转移到增强普通模型的防御能力。

Abstract: Despite extensive safety-tuning, large language models (LLMs) remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks via adversarially crafted instructions,
reflecting a persistent trade-off between safety and task performance. In this
work, we propose Intent-FT, a simple and lightweight fine-tuning approach that
explicitly trains LLMs to infer the underlying intent of an instruction before
responding. By fine-tuning on a targeted set of adversarial instructions,
Intent-FT enables LLMs to generalize intent deduction to unseen attacks,
thereby substantially improving their robustness. We comprehensively evaluate
both parametric and non-parametric attacks across open-source and proprietary
models, considering harmfulness from attacks, utility, over-refusal, and impact
against white-box threats. Empirically, Intent-FT consistently mitigates all
evaluated attack categories, with no single attack exceeding a 50\% success
rate -- whereas existing defenses remain only partially effective. Importantly,
our method preserves the model's general capabilities and reduces excessive
refusals on benign instructions containing superficially harmful keywords.
Furthermore, models trained with Intent-FT accurately identify hidden harmful
intent in adversarial attacks, and these learned intentions can be effectively
transferred to enhance vanilla model defenses.

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的安全性能，发现中间令牌对安全性更关键，提出了一种针对中间令牌的安全对齐方法MOSA，在多个攻击方法和基准测试中表现出优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为新兴的非自回归范式，目前缺乏对其安全性的系统研究，需要开发专门针对其生成特性的安全对齐方法。

Method: 提出Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA)方法，利用强化学习直接对齐模型的中间生成过程与安全拒绝响应，基于发现的中问令牌对安全性的关键作用。

Result: 在8种攻击方法和2个基准测试中，MOSA表现出优越的安全性能，同时在编码、数学和通用推理任务上保持了良好的实用性。

Conclusion: dLLMs存在防御者和攻击者之间的关键不对称性，中间令牌对齐是提升dLLMs安全性的有效策略，MOSA方法为这类模型的安全对齐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive non-autoregressive paradigm due to their unique training and
inference approach. However, there is currently a lack of safety study on this
novel architecture. In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs'
safety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to
their unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical
asymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the
defender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the
initial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this
seems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the
defender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate
middle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential
generation order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and
diverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this
asymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method
that directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals
exploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security
performance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the
utility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning. The
results strongly prove the superiority of MOSA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习虽然能保护数据隐私，但容易受到梯度反转攻击，需要建立理论框架来量化分析攻击与保护的复杂关系。

Method: 基于最大贝叶斯隐私(MBP)理论，形式化定义攻击复杂度(重建私密数据所需最小资源)和保护复杂度(隐私机制引入的期望失真)，推导理论边界。

Result: 获得了保护复杂度随模型维度和隐私预算的缩放边界，以及攻击复杂度对隐私泄露、梯度失真、模型维度和隐私级别的依赖关系。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了隐私保证、系统效用以及攻防努力之间的基本权衡，为设计更安全高效的联邦学习系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a promising paradigm for collaborative model
training while preserving data privacy. However, its susceptibility to gradient
inversion attacks poses a significant challenge, necessitating robust privacy
protection mechanisms. This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework to
decipher the intricate interplay between attack and protection complexities in
privacy-preserving FL. We formally define "Attack Complexity" as the minimum
computational and data resources an adversary requires to reconstruct private
data below a given error threshold, and "Protection Complexity" as the expected
distortion introduced by privacy mechanisms. Leveraging Maximum Bayesian
Privacy (MBP), we derive tight theoretical bounds for protection complexity,
demonstrating its scaling with model dimensionality and privacy budget.
Furthermore, we establish comprehensive bounds for attack complexity, revealing
its dependence on privacy leakage, gradient distortion, model dimension, and
the chosen privacy level. Our findings quantitatively illuminate the
fundamental trade-offs between privacy guarantees, system utility, and the
effort required for both attacking and defending. This framework provides
critical insights for designing more secure and efficient federated learning
systems.

Motivation: 解决比特币PoW机制存在的过高能消耗和硬件效率低下问题，将挖矿资源重定向有价值的计算工作

Method: 构建混合架构，让挖矿者贡献计算资源进行机器学习模型训练，中央服务器根据参数数量和损失减少量评估贡献，通过加权抽奖选出胜利者获得认证书以添加新块

Result: 实现了将能消耗转化为有价值计算工作的目标，保持了区块链完整性和安全性，解决了PoW的可持续性问题

Conclusion: 该混合架构成功将比特币挖矿从无意义的计算转向生产性机器学习训练，在保持区块链安全性的同时实现了能源利用效率的显著提升

Abstract: Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, while central to achieving
decentralized consensus, has long been criticized for excessive energy use and
hardware inefficiencies \cite{devries2018bitcoin, truby2018decarbonizing}. This
paper introduces a hybrid architecture that replaces Bitcoin's traditional PoW
with a centralized, cloud-based collaborative training framework. In this
model, miners contribute computing resources to train segments of horizontally
scaled machine learning models on preprocessed datasets, ensuring privacy and
generating meaningful outputs \cite{li2017securing}. A central server evaluates
contributions using two metrics: number of parameters trained and reduction in
model loss during each cycle. At the end of every cycle, a weighted lottery
selects the winning miner, who receives a digitally signed certificate. This
certificate serves as a verifiable substitute for PoW and grants the right to
append a block to the blockchain \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. By integrating
digital signatures and SHA-256 hashing \cite{nist2015sha}, the system preserves
blockchain integrity while redirecting energy toward productive computation.
The proposed approach addresses the sustainability concerns of traditional
mining by converting resource expenditure into socially valuable work, aligning
security incentives with real-world computational progress.

Motivation: 自主网络（Agentic Web）面临着严重的安全挑战，特别是LPCI（连接拉普拉斯计算机令牌）攻击。需要一种统一的安全架构来强化其安全性，建立可靠的自主生态系统。

Method: 构建基于零信任IAM框架的统一安全架构，采用去中心化标识符（DIDs）和可验证凭证（VCs）来建立丰富的身份验证机制。通过协议无关的自主名称服务（ANS）进行发现管理，并通过多层信任织物实现安全运营，包括信任适配运行环境（TARE）、因果链审计和动态身份与行为证言等创新技术。

Abstract: This paper presents a Unified Security Architecture that fortifies the
Agentic Web through a Zero-Trust IAM framework. This architecture is built on a
foundation of rich, verifiable agent identities using Decentralized Identifiers
(DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), with discovery managed by a
protocol-agnostic Agent Name Service (ANS). Security is operationalized through
a multi-layered Trust Fabric which introduces significant innovations,
including Trust-Adaptive Runtime Environments (TARE), Causal Chain Auditing,
and Dynamic Identity with Behavioral Attestation. By explicitly linking the
LPCI threat to these enhanced architectural countermeasures within a formal
security model, we propose a comprehensive and forward-looking blueprint for a
secure, resilient, and trustworthy agentic ecosystem. Our formal analysis
demonstrates that the proposed architecture provides provable security
guarantees against LPCI attacks with bounded probability of success.

TL;DR: LumiMAS是一个新颖的多智能体系统观测框架，通过三层架构（监控日志层、异常检测层、异常解释层）来检测和分析MAS中的系统级故障，解决了现有方法只关注单个智能体的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多智能体系统中的集成虽然能提升复杂问题解决能力，但带来了监控、解释和检测系统故障的新挑战。现有观测框架主要分析单个智能体，忽略了整个MAS的系统级故障。

Method: 提出三层框架：1）监控日志层记录智能体活动；2）异常检测层实时检测MAS工作流异常；3）异常解释层进行分类和根因分析。在7个不同MAS应用上评估，包括针对幻觉和偏见效应的定制应用。

Result: 评估结果表明LumiMAS在故障检测、分类和根因分析方面具有显著效果，能够有效识别和处理MAS中的系统级异常。

Conclusion: LumiMAS框架成功解决了多智能体系统观测中的关键挑战，为MAS的可靠运行提供了有效的监控和分析工具，特别是在处理幻觉和偏见等新型故障方面表现出色。

Abstract: The incorporation of large language models in multi-agent systems (MASs) has
the potential to significantly improve our ability to autonomously solve
complex problems. However, such systems introduce unique challenges in
monitoring, interpreting, and detecting system failures. Most existing MAS
observability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately,
overlooking failures associated with the entire MAS. To bridge this gap, we
propose LumiMAS, a novel MAS observability framework that incorporates advanced
analytics and monitoring techniques. The proposed framework consists of three
key components: a monitoring and logging layer, anomaly detection layer, and
anomaly explanation layer. LumiMAS's first layer monitors MAS executions,
creating detailed logs of the agents' activity. These logs serve as input to
the anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in
real time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root
cause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven
different MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a
diverse set of possible failures. The applications include two novel
failure-tailored applications that illustrate the effects of a hallucination or
bias on the MAS. The evaluation results demonstrate LumiMAS's effectiveness in
failure detection, classification, and RCA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可信引导方法在MEC基于IIoT系统中存在三个主要问题：消费者无法与不熟悉服务长期交互获取稳健的可信度测量；无法一致与同伴交互获取可靠推荐；不同MEC环境中不均匀的上下文参数导致不同的可信评估环境。

Method: 采用数据驱动和上下文感知方法，通过在给定MEC拓扑结构内的不同MEC环境之间促进知识共享，解决数据稀疏问题。

Result: 在两个经过适当调整的真实世界数据集上进行了全面评估，实验结果证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了MEC基于IIoT系统中的可信引导问题，适合在这类系统中引导IoT服务的可信过程。

Abstract: We propose a data-driven and context-aware approach to bootstrap
trustworthiness of homogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) services in Mobile Edge
Computing (MEC) based industrial IoT (IIoT) systems. The proposed approach
addresses key limitations in adapting existing trust bootstrapping approaches
into MEC-based IIoT systems. These key limitations include, the lack of
opportunity for a service consumer to interact with a lesser-known service over
a prolonged period of time to get a robust measure of its trustworthiness,
inability of service consumers to consistently interact with their peers to
receive reliable recommendations of the trustworthiness of a lesser-known
service as well as the impact of uneven context parameters in different MEC
environments causing uneven trust environments for trust evaluation. In
addition, the proposed approach also tackles the problem of data sparsity via
enabling knowledge sharing among different MEC environments within a given MEC
topology. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out
a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets suitably adjusted to
exhibit the context-dependent trust information accumulated in MEC environments
within a given MEC topology. The experimental results affirmed the
effectiveness of our approach and its suitability to bootstrap trustworthiness
of services in MEC-based IIoT systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB)，通过定量分析曝露了Model Context Protocol (MCP)的31种攻击方法的故障故障，为MCP安全提供了基础框架支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP协议虽然提供了AI代理与外部工具的无缝连接，但同时引入了重大安全漏洞，当前学术界对MCP安全的研究较为有限且偏向定性分析，无法涵盖实际威胁的多样性。

Method: 构建了MCP Attack Library (MCPLIB)，将6531种攻击方法分为四大类别：直接工具注入、间接工具注入、恶意用户攻击和LLM内在攻击，并进行了定量分析。

Result: 实验结果显示了关键漏洞：代理对工具描述的盲目依赖、对文件基攻击的敏感性、利用共享上下文的链式攻击、以及区分外部数据与可执行命令的困难。

Conclusion: 这项工作为MCP安全机制的提升提供了基础框架，支持MCP生态系统的安全进化，强调了开发健壮防御策略和明智的MCP设计的紧迫性。

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a universal standard that
enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools, significantly
enhancing their functionality. However, while MCP brings notable benefits, it
also introduces significant vulnerabilities, such as Tool Poisoning Attacks
(TPA), where hidden malicious instructions exploit the sycophancy of large
language models (LLMs) to manipulate agent behavior. Despite these risks,
current academic research on MCP security remains limited, with most studies
focusing on narrow or qualitative analyses that fail to capture the diversity
of real-world threats. To address this gap, we present the MCP Attack Library
(MCPLIB), which categorizes and implements 31 distinct attack methods under
four key classifications: direct tool injection, indirect tool injection,
malicious user attacks, and LLM inherent attack. We further conduct a
quantitative analysis of the efficacy of each attack. Our experiments reveal
key insights into MCP vulnerabilities, including agents' blind reliance on tool
descriptions, sensitivity to file-based attacks, chain attacks exploiting
shared context, and difficulty distinguishing external data from executable
commands. These insights, validated through attack experiments, underscore the

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained
model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior,
fulfilling "right to be forgotten" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we
observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in
analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in
terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.
Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,
making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To
fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,
designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system
supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and
attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two
models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,
at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made
after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks
(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to
determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.
We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU
methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model
behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.

Motivation: 解决MLaaS系统中数据隐私泄漏问题，改善现有同态加密和秘密分享方案在卷积运算中的效率瓶颈

Result: 在10个数据集和多种CNN模型上进行了广泛实验，实现了26-87倍的速度提升，验证成功概率至少1-1/|Z|

Conclusion: 该方案为资源受限客户端提供了高效、安全且可验证的计算外包服务，在保护数据隐私的同时显著提升了性能

Abstract: The widespread adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in
resource-constrained scenarios has driven the development of Machine Learning
as a Service (MLaaS) system. However, this approach is susceptible to privacy
leakage, as the data sent from the client to the untrusted cloud server often
contains sensitive information. Existing CNN privacy-preserving schemes, while
effective in ensuring data confidentiality through homomorphic encryption and
secret sharing, face efficiency bottlenecks, particularly in convolution
operations. In this paper, we propose a novel verifiable privacy-preserving
scheme tailored for CNN convolutional layers. Our scheme enables efficient
encryption and decryption, allowing resource-constrained clients to securely
offload computations to the untrusted cloud server. Additionally, we present a
verification mechanism capable of detecting the correctness of the results with
a success probability of at least $1-\frac{1}{\left|Z\right|}$. Extensive
experiments conducted on 10 datasets and various CNN models demonstrate that
our scheme achieves speedups ranging $26 \times$ ~ $\ 87\times$ compared to the
original plaintext model while maintaining accuracy.

TL;DR: SecFSM是一种利用安全知识图谱指导LLM生成更安全Verilog代码的新方法，专门针对FSM实现中的安全漏洞问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统硬件工程师手动编写Verilog代码实现FSM耗时且易出错，LLM生成的代码存在安全漏洞，特别是对安全敏感的FSM实现尤为关键

Method: 首先构建FSM安全知识图谱(FSKG)作为LLM的外部辅助，分析用户需求识别漏洞，基于漏洞列表从FSKG检索知识，构建安全提示用于Verilog代码生成

Result: 在25个安全测试用例基准上，SecFSM取得了21/25的优异通过率，优于现有最先进基线方法

Conclusion: SecFSM通过安全知识图谱有效提升了LLM生成Verilog代码的安全性，为自动化硬件设计提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a critical role in implementing control
logic for Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Traditionally, FSMs are implemented by
hardware engineers through Verilog coding, which is often tedious and
time-consuming. Recently, with the remarkable progress of Large Language Models
(LLMs) in code generation, LLMs have been increasingly explored for automating
Verilog code generation. However, LLM-generated Verilog code often suffers from
security vulnerabilities, which is particularly concerning for
security-sensitive FSM implementations. To address this issue, we propose
SecFSM, a novel method that leverages a security-oriented knowledge graph to
guide LLMs in generating more secure Verilog code. Specifically, we first
construct a FSM Security Knowledge Graph (FSKG) as an external aid to LLMs.
Subsequently, we analyze users' requirements to identify vulnerabilities and
get a list of vulnerabilities in the requirements. Then, we retrieve knowledge
from FSKG based on the vulnerabilities list. Finally, we construct security
prompts based on the security knowledge for Verilog code generation. To
evaluate SecFSM, we build a dedicated dataset collected from academic datasets,
artificial datasets, papers, and industrial cases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SecFSM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In particular,
on a benchmark of 25 security test cases evaluated by DeepSeek-R1, SecFSM
achieves an outstanding pass rate of 21/25.

TL;DR: VerilogLAVD是一种基于LLM的图遍历规则生成方法，用于Verilog漏洞检测，通过结合语法和语义信息构建统一表示，显著提升检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有早期硬件漏洞检测技术需要专业安全知识，限制了可用性。LLM在Verilog漏洞检测中难以捕捉代码结构，导致检测结果不一致

Method: 提出Verilog属性图(VeriPG)统一表示，结合AST语法特征和控制流/数据依赖图的语义信息。利用LLM从CWE描述生成基于VeriPG的检测规则，指导规则执行器遍历图结构检测漏洞

Result: 在包含12种CWE类型的77个Verilog设计上评估，F1-score达到0.54，相比纯LLM和带外部知识的LLM基线分别提升0.31和0.27

Conclusion: VerilogLAVD通过图结构表示和规则生成方法，有效解决了LLM在硬件漏洞检测中的结构理解问题，显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Timely detection of hardware vulnerabilities during the early design stage is
critical for reducing remediation costs. Existing early detection techniques
often require specialized security expertise, limiting their usability. Recent
efforts have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for Verilog
vulnerability detection. However, LLMs struggle to capture the structure in
Verilog code, resulting in inconsistent detection results. To this end, we
propose VerilogLAVD, the first LLM-aided graph traversal rule generation
approach for Verilog vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces the
Verilog Property Graph (VeriPG), a unified representation of Verilog code. It
combines syntactic features extracted from the abstract syntax tree (AST) with
semantic information derived from control flow and data dependency graphs. We
leverage LLMs to generate VeriPG-based detection rules from Common Weakness
Enumeration (CWE) descriptions. These rules guide the rule executor that
traversal VeriPG for potential vulnerabilities. To evaluate VerilogLAVD, we
build a dataset collected from open-source repositories and synthesized data.
In our empirical evaluation on 77 Verilog designs encompassing 12 CWE types,
VerilogLAVD achieves an F1-score of 0.54. Compared to the LLM-only and LLM with
external knowledge baselines, VerilogLAVD improves F1-score by 0.31 and 0.27,
respectively.

Conclusion: 该统一策略在预测准确性和可解释性方面都超过传统和神经网络模型，为超弹性领域提供了一种健壮的自动化模型发现工具

Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material
is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function
depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven
framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive
models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach
identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized
invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from
experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant
choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery
process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous
family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different
material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using
popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method
recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For
brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches,
capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological
matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework
provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range
of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated
and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.

Abstract: Dynamic brain data, teeming with biological and functional insights, are
becoming increasingly accessible through advanced measurements, providing a
gateway to understanding the inner workings of the brain in living subjects.
However, the vast size and intricate complexity of the data also pose a
daunting challenge in reliably extracting meaningful information across various
data sources. This paper introduces a generalizable unsupervised deep manifold
learning for exploration of neurocognitive and behavioral patterns. Unlike
existing methods that extract patterns directly from the input data as in the
existing methods, the proposed Brain-dynamic Convolutional-Network-based
Embedding (BCNE) seeks to capture the brain-state trajectories by deciphering
the temporospatial correlations within the data and subsequently applying
manifold learning to this correlative representation. The performance of BCNE
is showcased through the analysis of several important dynamic brain datasets.
The results, both visual and quantitative, reveal a diverse array of intriguing
and interpretable patterns. BCNE effectively delineates scene transitions,
underscores the involvement of different brain regions in memory and narrative
processing, distinguishes various stages of dynamic learning processes, and
identifies differences between active and passive behaviors. BCNE provides an
effective tool for exploring general neuroscience inquiries or
individual-specific patterns.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a biologically plausible and
energy-efficient framework for temporal information processing. However,
existing studies overlook a fundamental property widely observed in biological
neurons-synaptic heterogeneity, which plays a crucial role in temporal
processing and cognitive capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce HetSyn,
a generalized framework that models synaptic heterogeneity with
synapse-specific time constants. This design shifts temporal integration from
the membrane potential to the synaptic current, enabling versatile timescale
integration and allowing the model to capture diverse synaptic dynamics. We
implement HetSyn as HetSynLIF, an extended form of the leaky integrate-and-fire
(LIF) model equipped with synapse-specific decay dynamics. By adjusting the
parameter configuration, HetSynLIF can be specialized into vanilla LIF neurons,
neurons with threshold adaptation, and neuron-level heterogeneous models. We
demonstrate that HetSynLIF not only improves the performance of SNNs across a
variety of tasks-including pattern generation, delayed match-to-sample, speech
recognition, and visual recognition-but also exhibits strong robustness to
noise, enhanced working memory performance, efficiency under limited neuron
resources, and generalization across timescales. In addition, analysis of the
learned synaptic time constants reveals trends consistent with empirical
observations in biological synapses. These findings underscore the significance
of synaptic heterogeneity in enabling efficient neural computation, offering
new insights into brain-inspired temporal modeling.

Abstract: Robust information representation and its persistent maintenance are
fundamental for higher cognitive functions. Existing models employ distinct
neural mechanisms to separately address noise-resistant processing or
information maintenance, yet a unified framework integrating both operations
remains elusive -- a critical gap in understanding cortical computation. Here,
we introduce a recurrent neural circuit that combines divisive normalization
with self-excitation to achieve both robust encoding and stable retention of
normalized inputs. Mathematical analysis shows that, for suitable parameter
regimes, the system forms a continuous attractor with two key properties: (1)
input-proportional stabilization during stimulus presentation; and (2)
self-sustained memory states persisting after stimulus offset. We demonstrate
the model's versatility in two canonical tasks: (a) noise-robust encoding in a
random-dot kinematogram (RDK) paradigm; and (b) approximate Bayesian belief
updating in a probabilistic Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (pWCST). This work
establishes a unified mathematical framework that bridges noise suppression,
working memory, and approximate Bayesian inference within a single cortical
microcircuit, offering fresh insights into the brain's canonical computation
and guiding the design of biologically plausible artificial neural
architectures.

Abstract: Arthropods, including pollinators, respond to environmental electrical
fields. Here, we show that electric field information can be decoded to
reconstruct environmental features. We develop an algorithm capable of
inferring the shapes of polarisable flowers from the electric field generated
by a nearby charged bee. We simulated electric fields arising from bee flower
interactions for flowers with varying petal geometries. These simulated data
were used to train a deep learning UNet model to recreate petal shapes. The
model accurately reconstructed diverse flower shapes including more complex
flower shapes not included in training. Reconstruction performance peaked at an
optimal bee flower distance, indicating distance-dependent encoding of shape
information. These findings show that electroreception can impart rich spatial
detail, offering insights into arthropod environmental perception.

Abstract: There is a tradeoff between attaining statistical power with large, difficult
to gather data sets, and producing highly scalable assays that register brief
data samples. Often, as grand-averaging techniques a priori assume
normally-distributed parameters and linear, stationary processes in
biorhythmic, time series data, important information is lost, averaged out as
gross data. We developed an affective computing platform that enables taking
brief data samples while maintaining personalized statistical power. This is
achieved by combining a new data type derived from the micropeaks present in
time series data registered from brief (5-second-long) face videos with recent
advances in AI-driven face-grid estimation methods. By adopting geometric and
nonlinear dynamical systems approaches to analyze the kinematics, especially
the speed data, the new methods capture all facial micropeaks. These include as
well the nuances of different affective micro expressions. We offer new ways to
differentiate dynamical and geometric patterns present in autistic individuals
from those found more commonly in neurotypical development.

Abstract: Empowered by deep learning, semantic communication marks a paradigm shift
from transmitting raw data to conveying task-relevant meaning, enabling more
efficient and intelligent wireless systems. In this study, we explore a deep
learning-based task-oriented communication framework that jointly considers
classification performance, computational latency, and communication cost. We
adopt ResNets-based models and evaluate them on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100

We partition the model at various points to simulate split inference across a
wireless channel. By varying the split location and the size of the transmitted
semantic feature vector, we systematically analyze the trade-offs between task
accuracy and resource efficiency. Experimental results show that, with
appropriate model partitioning and semantic feature compression, the system can
retain over 85\% of baseline accuracy while significantly reducing both
computational load and communication overhead.

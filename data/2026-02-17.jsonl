Current studies convert flowcharts into interlanguages (e.g., Graphviz) for Question Answering (QA), which effectively bridge modal gaps between questions and flowcharts. More importantly, they reveal the link relations between nodes in the flowchart, facilitating a shallow relation reasoning during tracing answers. However, the existing interlanguages still lose sight of intricate semantic/logic relationships such as Conditional and Causal relations. This hinders the deep reasoning for complex questions. To address the issue, we propose a novel Semantic Relation-Aware (SRA) FlowchartQA approach. It leverages Large Language Model (LLM) to detect the discourse semantic relations between nodes, by which a link-based interlanguage is upgraded to the semantic relation based interlanguage. In addition, we conduct an interlanguage-controllable reasoning process. In this process, the question intention is analyzed with the aim to determine the depth of reasoning (Shallow or Deep reasoning), as well as the well-matched interlanguage. We experiment on the benchmark dataset FlowVQA. The test results show that SRA yields widespread improvements when upgrading different interlanguages like Graphviz, Mermaid and Plantuml"}

While vision-language models like CLIP have popularized this task by embedding multiple modalities into a joint space, developers still lack tools that reveal how these multimodal prompts interact with embedding spaces and why small wording changes can dramatically alter the results. We present InfoCIR, a visual analytics system that closes this gap by coupling retrieval, explainability, and prompt engineering in a single, interactive dashboard. InfoCIR integrates a state-of-the-art CIR back-end (SEARLE arXiv:2303.15247) with a six-panel interface that (i) lets users compose image + text queries, (ii) projects the top-k results into a low-dimensional space using Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for spatial reasoning, (iii) overlays similarity-based saliency maps and gradient-derived token-attribution bars for local explanation, and (iv) employs an LLM-powered prompt enhancer that generates counterfactual variants and visualizes how these changes affect the ranking of user-selected target images. A modular architecture built on Plotly-Dash allows new models, datasets, and attribution methods to be plugged in with minimal effort. We argue that InfoCIR helps diagnose retrieval failures, guides prompt enhancement, and accelerates insight generation during model development.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness."}

Existing deep models trained on large datasets remain largely uninterpretable, often insufficiently modeling underlying emotional acoustic signals and failing to capture and analyze the core physiology of emotional vocal behaviors. Physiological research on human voices shows that the dynamics of vocal amplitude and phase correlate with emotions through the vocal tract filter and the glottal source. However, most existing deep models solely involve amplitude but fail to couple the physiological features of and between amplitude and phase. Here, we propose PhysioSER, a physiology-informed vocal spectrotemporal representation learning method, to address these issues with a compact, plug-and-play design. PhysioSER constructs amplitude and phase views informed by voice anatomy and physiology (VAP) to complement SSL models for SER. This VAP-informed framework incorporates two parallel workflows: a vocal feature representation branch to decompose vocal signals based on VAP, embed them into a quaternion field, and use Hamilton-structured quaternion convolutions for modeling their dynamic interactions; and a latent representation branch based on a frozen SSL backbone. Then, utterance-level features from both workflows are aligned by a Contrastive Projection and Alignment framework, followed by a shallow attention fusion head for SER classification. PhysioSER is shown to be interpretable and efficient for SER through extensive evaluations across 14 datasets, 10 languages, and 6 backbones, and its practical efficacy is validated by real-time deployment on a humanoid robotic platform."}

However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines."}

While AI offers substantial efficiency improvements, existing solutions lack comprehensive reasoning capabilities and internal mechanisms to ensure reliability within regulated, high-stakes environments. Full automation remains impractical and inadvisable in scenarios where human judgment and accountability are critical. This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design. These findings indicate that adversarial self-critique supports safer AI deployment in regulated domains and offers a model for responsible integration where human oversight is indispensable."}

Map-free LiDAR relocalization offers an effective solution for achieving high-precision positioning in environments with weak or unavailable GNSS signals.

In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin.

We introduce Directional Concentration Uncertainty (DCU), a novel statistical procedure for quantifying the concentration of embeddings based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains.

The key challenge is auditable coordination among specialised humans, robots, and digital services in a safety-critical system-of-systems. We introduce Agent Mars, an open, end-to-end multi-agent simulation framework for Mars base operations. Agent Mars formalises a realistic organisation with a 93-agent roster across seven layers of command and execution (human roles and physical assets), enabling base-scale studies beyond toy settings.

Agent Mars further models mission-critical mechanisms-scenario-aware short/long-horizon memory, configurable propose-vote consensus, and translator-mediated heterogeneous protocols-to capture how teams align under stress. To quantify behaviour, we propose the Agent Mars Performance Index (AMPI), an interpretable composite score with diagnostic sub-metrics. Across 13 reproducible Mars-relevant operational scripts, Agent Mars reveals coordination trade-offs and identifies regimes where curated cross-layer collaboration and functional leadership reduce overhead without sacrificing reliability.

Existing detection methods primarily depend on XLS-R front-end features to improve generalization. Nonetheless, their performance remains limited, partly due to insufficient attention to fine-grained information, such as physiological cues or frequency-domain features. In this paper, we propose BreathNet, a novel audio deepfake detection framework that integrates fine-grained breath information to improve generalization. Specifically, we design BreathFiLM, a feature-wise linear modulation mechanism that selectively amplifies temporal representations based on the presence of breathing sounds. BreathFiLM is trained jointly with the XLS-R extractor, in turn encouraging the extractor to learn and encode breath-related cues into the temporal features. Then, we use the frequency front-end to extract spectral features, which are then fused with temporal features to provide complementary information introduced by vocoders or compression artifacts. Additionally, we propose a group of feature losses comprising Positive-only Supervised Contrastive Loss (PSCL), center loss, and contrast loss. These losses jointly enhance the discriminative ability, encouraging the model to separate bona fide and deepfake samples more effectively in the feature space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Using the ASVspoof 2019 LA training set, our method attains 1.99% average EER across four related eval benchmarks, with particularly strong performance on the In-the-Wild dataset, where it achieves 4.70% EER.

The central challenge is establishing a scalable evaluation framework that measures LLM strategic reasoning against consistent, interpretable standards rather than volatile peer models. Here we show that anchoring LLM evaluation to fixed hierarchies of skill-calibrated game Artificial Intelligence (AI) enables linear-time absolute skill measurement with stable cross-temporal interpretability.

However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability."}

As forces are applied to the pad, the air channels compress, resulting in a pressure change measurable by off-the-shelf pressure transducers. We demonstrate in benchtop testing that pad pressure is highly linearly related to applied force ($R^2 = 0.998$). This is confirmed with clinical dynamometer correlations with isometric knee torque, where above-knee pressure was highly correlated with flexion torque ($R^2 = 0.95$), while below-knee pressure was highly correlated with extension torque ($R^2 = 0.75$). We build on these idealized settings to test pad performance in more unconstrained settings. We place the pad over \\textit{biceps brachii} during cyclic curls and stepwise isometric holds, observing a correlation between pressure and elbow angle. Finally, we integrated the sensor into the strap of a lower-extremity robotic exoskeleton and recorded pad pressure during repeated squats with the device unpowered. Pad pressure tracked squat phase and overall task dynamics consistently. Overall, our preliminary results suggest fluidic innervation is a readily customizable sensing modality with high signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution for capturing human-machine mechanical interaction. In the long-term, this modality may provide an alternative real-time sensing input to control / optimize wearable robotic systems and to capture user function during device use."}

This study focuses on detecting abusive obfuscated language in Swahili, a low-resource language that poses unique challenges due to its limited linguistic resources and technological support. Swahili is chosen due to its popularity and being the most widely spoken language in Africa, with over 16 million native speakers and upwards of 100 million speakers in total, spanning regions in East Africa and some parts of the Middle East.\n  We employed machine learning models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, optimized through rigorous parameter tuning and techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle data imbalance. Our analysis revealed that, while these models perform well in high-dimensional textual data, our dataset's small size and imbalance limit our findings' generalizability. Precision, recall, and F1 scores were thoroughly analyzed, highlighting the nuanced performance of each model in detecting obfuscated language.\n  This research contributes to the broader discourse on ensuring safer online environments for children, advocating for expanded datasets and advanced machine-learning techniques to improve the effectiveness of cyberbullying detection systems.

State Space Models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives but struggle with precise information retrieval over a long horizon. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition (Kahneman, 2011), we propose AMOR (Adaptive Metacognitive Output Router), a hybrid architecture that dynamically engages sparse attention only when an SSM backbone is \"uncertain\"--as measured by prediction entropy. Compared to standard transformers, AMOR gains efficiency by projecting keys and values from SSM hidden states (Ghost KV), reusing the SSM's O(n) computation rather than requiring O(n^2) attention at every layer. On small-scale synthetic retrieval tasks, AMOR outperforms both SSM-only and transformer-only baselines, achieving perfect retrieval accuracy while engaging attention on only 22% of positions. We validate that prediction entropy reliably signals retrieval need, with a gap of 1.09 nats (nearly half the entropy range) between retrieval and local positions.

However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance. Qualitative results show COOPERTRIM gracefully adapts to environmental dynamics, localization error, and communication latency, demonstrating flexibility and paving the way for real-world deployment."}

The development process of PSCs is precise and complex, involving a series of closed-loop workflows such as literature retrieval, data integration, experimental design, and synthesis. However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments."}

We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup.

We find that language model embeddings typically contain relatively little input information regardless of data and compute scale during training. In contrast, embeddings from autoencoders trained for input regeneration are capable of nearly perfect memory formation. The substitution of memory embeddings for token sequences leads to substantial computational efficiencies, motivating the introduction of a parallelizable encoder-decoder memory model architecture. Upon causal training these models contain information-poor embeddings incapable of arbitrary information access, but by combining causal and information retention objective functions they learn to form and decode information-rich memories. Training can be further streamlined by freezing a high fidelity encoder followed by a curriculum training approach where decoders first learn to process memories and then learn to additionally predict next tokens. We introduce the perspective that next token prediction training alone is poorly suited for accurate memory formation as the objective itself is non-invertible, motivating the use of combined objective functions for models where the entire input is not exposed."}

To measure genuine AI progress, we need evaluation that is robust by construction, not by post-hoc detection. In response, we propose VeRA (Verified Reasoning Data Augmentation), a framework that converts benchmark problems into executable specifications, comprising (i) a natural language template with placeholder slots, (ii) a coherent generator that samples valid configurations, and (iii) a deterministic verifier that validates parameters and calculates the corresponding correct answers for each configuration. From a single seed problem, VeRA automatically creates unlimited verified variants with reliable labels at near-zero marginal cost without human involvement.\n  VeRA operates in two complementary modes. VeRA-E (equivalent) rewrites problems while keeping the underlying logic intact, useful for detecting memorization versus genuine reasoning. VeRA-H (hardened) systematically increases complexity while remaining verifiable, enabling reliable creation and labelling of fresh difficult tasks at the boundary of intelligence. Evaluating 16 frontier models with VeRA, we find: (i) VeRA-E improves evaluation quality and reveals contamination patterns. (ii) VeRA-H enables human-free generation of hard tasks with reliable labels. (iii) VeRA establishes verified benchmarks as a general paradigm. VeRA reconceptualizes benchmarks from static objects used until exhausted, to executable specifications generating fresh, verified instances on demand, enhancing robustness and cost-effectiveness for evaluation.\n  With VeRA, we envision that evaluation in any verifiable domain can scale indefinitely without sacrificing label integrity.

We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand.

This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics. The results confirm the assumptions underlying the speed-up factor, demonstrate its accuracy in capturing the described fraction, and reveal its superior stability across iterations."}

We address these limitations by introducing risk aversion with respect to the initial population distribution and by incorporating bounded rationality to model deviations from fully rational decision-making agents. The combination of these two elements yields a new and more general equilibrium concept, which we term the mean-field risk-averse quantal response equilibrium (MF-RQE). We establish existence results and prove convergence of fixed-point iteration and fictitious play to MF-RQE. Building on these insights, we develop a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for scenarios with large state-action spaces. Numerical experiments demonstrate that MF-RQE policies achieve improved robustness relative to classical mean-field approaches that optimize expected cumulative rewards under a fixed initial distribution and are restricted to entropy-based regularizers."}

Each sacrificial agent follows a straight-line trajectory toward an adversary and reports whether it was intercepted or survived. These binary outcomes are related to the pursuer's parameters through a geometric reachable-region (RR) model. Two formulations are introduced: a boundary-interception case, where capture occurs at the RR boundary, and an interior-interception case, which allows capture anywhere within it. The pursuer's parameters are inferred using a gradient-based multi-start optimization with custom loss functions tailored to each case.\n  Two trajectory-selection strategies are proposed for the sacrificial agents: a geometric heuristic that maximizes the spread of expected interception points, and a Bayesian experimental-design method that maximizes the D-score of the expected Gauss-Newton information matrix, thereby selecting trajectories that yield maximal information gain. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate accurate parameter recovery with five to twelve sacrificial agents. The learned engagement models are then used to generate safe, time-optimal paths for high-value agents that avoid all feasible pursuer engagement regions."}

This tradeoff creates a large, multi-objective design space in which traditional discovery is slow, often relying on expert intuition or exhaustive experimentation. We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability. Relative to a naive strategy and a strong baseline, our method improves dominated hypervolume by 9.5\\% and 4.5\\%, respectively, while reducing the number of experiments needed to reach high-quality solutions. In complementary synthetic studies, it recovers a comparably strong set of Pareto-optimal solutions using only 30\\% of the evaluations required by the prior state-of-the-art multi-objective approach, which amounts to saving approximately 10 weeks of experimental time.

However, the metadata needed for such search is often missing or incomplete, and requires significant manual effort to add. Existing solutions to automate this task by generating metadata, i.e. captioning, and search using learned embeddings, i.e. text-audio retrieval, are not trained on metadata with the structure and information pertinent to sound design. To this end we propose audiocards, structured metadata grounded in acoustic attributes and sonic descriptors, by exploiting the world knowledge of LLMs. We show that training on audiocards improves downstream text-audio retrieval, descriptive captioning, and metadata generation on professional sound effects libraries. Moreover, audiocards also improve performance on general audio captioning and retrieval over the baseline single-sentence captioning approach. We release a curated dataset of sound effects audiocards to invite further research in audio language modeling for sound design."}

Inspired by hierarchical control, AsyncVLA runs a large foundation model on a remote workstation to provide high-level guidance, while a lightweight, onboard Edge Adapter continuously refines actions at high frequency. To bridge the domain gap between these asynchronous streams, we introduce an end-to-end finetuning protocol and a trajectory re-weighting strategy that prioritizes dynamic interactions. We evaluate our approach on real-world vision-based navigation tasks with communication delays up to 6 seconds. AsyncVLA achieves a 40% higher success rate than state-of-the-art baselines, effectively bridging the gap between the semantic intelligence of large models and the reactivity required for edge robotics."}

However, recent findings suggest that raw token counts are unreliable proxies for reasoning quality: increased generation length does not consistently correlate with accuracy and may instead signal \"overthinking,\" leading to performance degradation. In this work, we quantify inference-time effort by identifying deep-thinking tokens -- tokens where internal predictions undergo significant revisions in deeper model layers prior to convergence. Across four challenging mathematical and scientific benchmarks (AIME 24/25, HMMT 25, and GPQA-diamond) and a diverse set of reasoning-focused models (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen3), we show that deep-thinking ratio (the proportion of deep-thinking tokens in a generated sequence) exhibits a robust and consistently positive correlation with accuracy, substantially outperforming both length-based and confidence-based baselines. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Think@n, a test-time scaling strategy that prioritizes samples with high deep-thinking ratios. We demonstrate that Think@n matches or exceeds standard self-consistency performance while significantly reducing inference costs by enabling the early rejection of unpromising generations based on short prefixes."}

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms."}

We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark.

We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \\in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest. These results provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical preference for normalization over clipping in large-scale model training."}

However, existing naturalness evaluators typically regress raw audio to scalar scores, offering limited interpretability of the evaluation and moreover fail to generalize to speech across different taxonomies. Inspired by recent advances in generative reward modeling, we propose the Generative Speech Reward Model (GSRM), a reasoning-centric reward model tailored for speech. The GSRM is trained to decompose speech naturalness evaluation into an interpretable acoustic feature extraction stage followed by feature-grounded chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling explainable judgments. To achieve this, we curated a large-scale human feedback dataset comprising 31k expert ratings and an out-of-domain benchmark of real-world user-assistant speech interactions. Experiments show that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors, achieving model-human correlation of naturalness score prediction that approaches human inter-rater consistency. We further show how GSRM can improve the naturalness of speech LLM generations by serving as an effective verifier for online RLHF."}

The core is a nonlinear program in the spatial domain built on a modified bicycle model with explicit feasibility and collision-avoidance penalties. The formulation naturally handles unknown obstacle classes and heterogeneous agent motion by operating purely in occupancy space. The pipeline runs in real-time (faster than 10 Hz on average), requires minimal tuning, and interfaces cleanly with standard control stacks. We validate our approach in simulation with severe localization and perception noises, and on an F1TENTH platform, demonstrating smooth and safe maneuvering through narrow passages and rough routes.

We show that this mismatch results from the stochastic nature of modern LLM decoding, under which single-response correctness fails to reflect underlying model capability. To address this issue, we introduce capability calibration, which targets the model's expected accuracy on a query. We formally distinguish capability calibration from response calibration and show that the two differ both theoretically and empirically. We establish an empirical evaluation setup and study a range of confidence estimation methods. Our results demonstrate that capability-calibrated confidence improves pass@$k$ prediction and inference budget allocation, establishing a foundation with potential for diverse applications."}

However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models.

However, these models are often limited by long-term instabilities, climatological drift, and substantial computational costs during training and inference, restricting their broader application for climate studies. Addressing these limitations, Guan et al. (2024) introduced LUCIE, a lightweight, physically consistent climate emulator utilizing a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture. This model is able to reproduce accurate long-term statistics including climatological mean and seasonal variability. However, LUCIE's native resolution (~300 km) is inadequate for detailed regional impact assessments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a deep learning-based downscaling framework, leveraging probabilistic diffusion-based generative models with conditional and posterior sampling frameworks. These models downscale coarse LUCIE outputs to 25 km resolution. They are trained on approximately 14,000 ERA5 timesteps spanning 2000-2009 and evaluated on LUCIE predictions from 2010 to 2020. Model performance is assessed through diverse metrics, including latitude-averaged RMSE, power spectrum, probability density functions and First Empirical Orthogonal Function of the zonal wind. We observe that the proposed approach is able to preserve the coarse-grained dynamics from LUCIE while generating fine-scaled climatological statistics at ~28km resolution."}

This is exacerbated when dealing with cognitive agent models, such as the Belief Desire Intention (BDI) model, where the agent codebase is not suitable to run unchanged in simulation environments, thus increasing the reality gap between the deployed and simulated systems. We argue that BDI developers should be able to test in simulation the same specification that will be later deployed, with no surrogate representations. Thus, in this paper, we discuss how the control flow of BDI agents can be mapped onto a Discrete Event Simulation (DES), showing that such integration is possible at different degrees of granularity. We substantiate our claims by producing an open-source prototype integration between two pre-existing tools (JaKtA and Alchemist), showing that it is possible to produce a simulation-based testing environment for distributed BDI} agents, and that different granularities in mapping BDI agents over DESs may lead to different degrees of fidelity."}

Moreover, FLIP substantially improves downstream performance in extrinsic evaluations under test-time scaling via parallel sampling and GRPO training. We further find that FLIP is particularly effective for longer outputs and robust to common forms of reward hacking.

We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems."}

The model adopts a unified end-to-end architecture composed of a lightweight language backbone, a Whisper-based audio encoder, and a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adapter that explicitly accounts for audio heterogeneity and alleviates cross-modal optimization conflicts under limited capacity. To further enhance paralinguistic reasoning, we introduce DataFlux, a closed loop audio instruction data synthesis and verification pipeline that constructs high quality, logically consistent supervision from raw audio. Extensive evaluations across ASR, knowledge reasoning, safety, instruction following, and paralinguistic benchmarks, demonstrate that Eureka-Audio achieves an efficient balance between computational cost and performance.

By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks."}

Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable."}

Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion."}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by integrating external knowledge, but its efficacy depends on accurate document retrieval and ranking. Although existing rerankers demonstrate effectiveness, they frequently necessitate specialized training, impose substantial computational expenses, and fail to fully exploit the semantic capabilities of LLMs, particularly their inherent confidence signals. We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis."}

A Persona-Targeted Attacker Cycle synthesizes progressively stronger jailbreak prompts, while a Role-Playing Defender Cycle distills observed failures into a hierarchical knowledge base of (i) global safety rules, (ii) persona-grounded constraints, and (iii) safe in-character exemplars. At inference time, the Defender retrieves and composes structured knowledge from this hierarchy to guide generation, producing responses that remain faithful to the target persona while satisfying safety constraints.

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice."}

Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms."}

However, this decoupled design can lead to unnecessary loss of visual information, particularly when image-based operations such as cropping are applied. In this paper, we propose Lang2Act, which enables fine-grained visual perception and reasoning through self-emergent linguistic toolchains. Rather than invoking fixed external engines, Lang2Act collects self-emergent actions as linguistic tools and leverages them to enhance the visual perception capabilities of VLMs. To support this mechanism, we design a two-stage Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training framework. Specifically, the first stage optimizes VLMs to self-explore high-quality actions for constructing a reusable linguistic toolbox, and the second stage further optimizes VLMs to exploit these linguistic tools for downstream reasoning effectively.

However, such manual ordering design can inevitably cause information loss and cumulative errors, lacking flexible and diverse relation modeling among different modules and sensors. Meanwhile, insufficient training of image backbone and quadratic-complexity of attention mechanism also hinder the scalability and efficiency of E2E-AD system to handle spatiotemporal input.

In practical deployments each subsystem (client) operates a fixed proprietary model that cannot be modified or retrained, limiting existing approaches. Nonlinear dynamics further make cross client temporal interdependencies difficult to interpret because they are embedded in nonlinear state transition functions. We present a federated framework for learning temporal interdependencies across clients under these constraints. Each client maps high dimensional local observations to low dimensional latent states using a nonlinear state space model. A central server learns a graph structured neural state transition model over the communicated latent states using a Graph Attention Network. For interpretability we relate the Jacobian of the learned server side transition model to attention coefficients, providing the first interpretable characterization of cross client temporal interdependencies in decentralized nonlinear systems. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees to a centralized oracle and validate the framework through synthetic experiments demonstrating convergence, interpretability, scalability and privacy. Additional real world experiments show performance comparable to decentralized baselines."}

Using a Transformer-based model, ROSA jointly predicts the future trajectories of vehicles and Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) at roundabouts. Trained for single-step prediction and deployed autoregressively, it generates deterministic outputs, enabling actionable speed advisories. Incorporating motion dynamics, the model achieves high accuracy (ADE: 1.29m, FDE: 2.99m at a five-second prediction horizon), surpassing prior work. Adding route intention further improves performance (ADE: 1.10m, FDE: 2.36m), demonstrating the value of connected vehicle data. Based on predicted conflicts with VRUs and circulating vehicles, ROSA provides real-time, proactive speed advisories for approaching and entering the roundabout.

Martial arts represent an extreme case of highly dynamic human motion, characterized by rapid center-of-mass shifts, complex coordination, and abrupt posture transitions. However, datasets tailored to such high-intensity scenarios remain scarce. To address this gap, we construct KungFuAthlete, a high-dynamic martial arts motion dataset derived from professional athletes' daily training videos. The dataset includes ground and jump subsets covering representative complex motion patterns. The jump subset exhibits substantially higher joint, linear, and angular velocities compared to commonly used datasets such as LAFAN1, PHUMA, and AMASS, indicating significantly increased motion intensity and complexity. Importantly, even professional athletes may fail during highly dynamic movements. Similarly, humanoid robots are prone to instability and falls under external disturbances or execution errors. Most prior work assumes motion execution remains within safe states and lacks a unified strategy for modeling unsafe states and enabling reliable autonomous recovery. We propose a novel training paradigm that enables a single policy to jointly learn high-dynamic motion tracking and fall recovery, unifying agile execution and stabilization within one framework. This framework expands robotic capability from pure motion tracking to recovery-enabled execution, promoting more robust and autonomous humanoid performance in real-world high-dynamic scenarios."}

Moreover, previous psycholinguistic and computational approaches overlooked the temporal dimension, although many literary metaphors were coined centuries apart from contemporary readers. This study innovatively applies tools from diachronic distributional semantics to assess whether the processing costs of literary metaphors varied over time and genre. Specifically, we trained word embeddings on literary and nonliterary Italian corpora from the 19th and 21st centuries, for a total of 124 million tokens, and modeled changes in the semantic similarity between topics and vehicles of 515 19th-century literary metaphors, taking this measure as a proxy of metaphor processing demands. Overall, semantic similarity, and hence metaphor processing demands, remained stable over time. However, genre played a key role: metaphors appeared more difficult (i.e., lower topic-vehicle similarity) in modern literary contexts than in 19th-century literature, but easier (i.e., higher topic-vehicle similarity) in today's nonliterary language (e.g., the Web) than in 19th-century nonliterary texts. This pattern was further shaped by semantic features of metaphors' individual terms, such as vector coherence and semantic neighborhood density. Collectively, these findings align with broader linguistic changes in Italian, such as the stylistic simplification of modern literature, which may have increased metaphor processing demands, and the high creativity of the Web's language, which seems to render metaphor more accessible."}

Recent work adopts structured reasoning pipelines that translate natural language into first-order logic and delegate inference to automated solvers. With the rise of large language models, approaches such as GCD and CODE4LOGIC leverage their reasoning and code generation capabilities to improve logic parsing. However, these methods suffer from fragile syntax control due to weak enforcement of global grammar constraints and low semantic faithfulness caused by insufficient clause-level semantic understanding. We propose NL2LOGIC, a first-order logic translation framework that introduces an abstract syntax tree as an intermediate representation. NL2LOGIC combines a recursive large language model based semantic parser with an abstract syntax tree guided generator that deterministically produces solver-ready logic code. Experiments on the FOLIO, LogicNLI, and ProofWriter benchmarks show that NL2LOGIC achieves 99 percent syntactic accuracy and improves semantic correctness by up to 30 percent over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating NL2LOGIC into Logic-LM yields near-perfect executability and improves downstream reasoning accuracy by 31 percent compared to Logic-LM's original few-shot unconstrained translation module."}

However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity."}

In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines."}

To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged \"wrist + contact force\" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing."}

While LLMs can detect surface-level similarity, they often fail to capture the pragmatic functions of rephrasing, such as its role within rhetorical discourse. This paper presents a comparative multi-agent framework designed to quantify the benefits of incorporating explicit theoretical knowledge for this task. We utilise an dataset of annotated political debates to establish a new standard encompassing four distinct rephrase functions: Deintensification, Intensification, Specification, Generalisation, and Other, which covers all remaining types (D-I-S-G-O). We then evaluate two parallel LLM-based agent systems: one enhanced by argumentation theory via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and an identical zero-shot baseline. The results reveal a clear performance gap: the RAG-enhanced agents substantially outperform the baseline across the board, with particularly strong advantages in detecting Intensification and Generalisation context, yielding an overall Macro F1-score improvement of nearly 30\\%. Our findings provide evidence that theoretical grounding is not only beneficial but essential for advancing beyond mere paraphrase detection towards function-aware analysis of argumentative discourse.

This paper presents an exploratory study evaluating these methods on 3B--7B parameter code models. We find that while PAC generally outperforms the Loss baseline, its effectiveness relies on augmentation strategies that disregard the rigid syntax of code, leading to performance degradation on larger, complex files. To address this, we introduce AST-PAC, a domain-specific adaptation that utilizes Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based perturbations to generate syntactically valid calibration samples. Preliminary results indicate that AST-PAC improves as syntactic size grows, where PAC degrades, but under-mutates small files and underperforms on alphanumeric-rich code. Overall, the findings motivate future work on syntax-aware and size-adaptive calibration as a prerequisite for reliable provenance auditing of code language models."}

WildfireVLM employs YOLOv12 to detect fire zones and smoke plumes, leveraging its ability to detect small, complex patterns in satellite imagery. We integrate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that convert detection outputs into contextualized risk assessments and prioritized response recommendations for disaster management. We validate the quality of risk reasoning using an LLM-as-judge evaluation with a shared rubric. The system is deployed using a service-oriented architecture that supports real-time processing, visual risk dashboards, and long-term wildfire tracking, demonstrating the value of combining computer vision with language-based reasoning for scalable wildfire monitoring."}

We introduce and study $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints."}

However, common pseudo-label selection heuristics are largely text-centric (e.g., perplexity (PPL) filtering) and can prefer fluent yet acoustically mismatched hypotheses, leading to error amplification when fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a multimodal consistency-guided, reference-free data selection pipeline for ASR accent adaptation under a transductive, label-free protocol. The pipeline starts with a target-aware preselection step based on submodular mutual information to improve query relevance and reduce downstream computation. It then generates multiple pseudo-transcriptions per utterance via perturbation-based decoding and scores each hypothesis using two reference-free signals: speech--text alignment in a shared embedding space and predicted word error rate (WER). A simple percentile-based selection rule retains reliable pseudo-labels for fine-tuning while discarding noisy utterances. In an in-domain setting, selecting ~1.5k utterances from a 30k pool achieves 10.91% WER, close to 10.45% obtained using 30k supervised labels. In a cross-domain setting with a mismatched candidate pool, consistency-filtered subsets avoid the degradation caused by unfiltered pseudo-labels under strong accent shift, and matched-hour experiments on a stronger ASR backbone further confirm gains over random sampling and recent selection baselines."}

Our approach explicitly enforces dense surface-visibility constraints to regularize replanning behavior in real-time via an efficient two-level decomposition: occlusion-free viewpoint repair that maintains coverage with minimal deviation from the nominal scan intent, followed by segment-wise clean-sensing connection in 5-DoF space. A plug-in integration strategy is also presented to seamlessly interface FC-Vision with existing UAV scanning systems without architectural changes. Comprehensive simulation and real-world evaluations show that FC-Vision consistently improves scanning quality under unexpected occluders, delivering a maximum coverage gain of 55.32% and a 73.17% reduction in the occlusion ratio, while achieving real-time performance with a moderate increase in flight time.

We propose a framework for automated creativity assessment of human paintings by fine-tuning the vision-language model Qwen2-VL-7B with multi-task learning. Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass. By embedding the structured rubric and the artwork description in the system prompt, we constrain the generated text to match the quantitative prediction. Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback."}

Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models."}

In this work, the adjustment of the speed profile of a Predictive Longitudinal Driving Function (PLDF) on a pre-defined route is highlighted. An algorithm is introduced which iteratively adjusts the PLDF's speed profile by taking into account both the original speed profile of the PLDF and the driver demonstration. This approach allows for personalization in a traded control scenario during active use of the PLDF. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is tested in a driving simulator-based test group study with 43 participants. The study finds a significant increase in driver satisfaction and a significant reduction in the intervention frequency when using the proposed adaptive PLDF.

In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE.

To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners. Empirical experiments validate QuaRK and illustrate the predicted interpolation and generalization behaviours on synthetic beta-mixing time series tasks."}

Using parameter-mapping sonification of the Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature anomaly index (1870--2024), we encode ENSO variability into two traditional Javanese gamelan pentatonic systems (pelog and slendro) across four composition strategies, then analyze the resulting audio as trajectories in a two-dimensional acoustic phase space. Recurrence-based diagnostics, convex hull geometry, and coupling analysis reveal that the sonification pipeline preserves key dynamical signatures: alternating modes produce the highest trajectory recurrence rates, echoing ENSO's quasi-periodicity; layered polyphonic modes explore the broadest phase space regions; and the two scale families induce qualitatively distinct coupling regimes between spectral brightness and energy -- predominantly anti-phase in pelog but near-independent in slendro. Phase space trajectory analysis provides a rigorous geometric framework for comparing sonification designs within a complex systems context.

However, most systems still rely on teleoperation, limiting scalability and response speed. Autonomous active GDM is challenging in unknown and cluttered environments, because the robot must simultaneously explore traversable space, map the environment, and infer the gas distribution belief from sparse chemical measurements. We address this by formulating active GDM as a next-best-trajectory informative path planning (IPP) problem and propose XIT (Exploration-Exploitation Informed Trees), a sampling-based planner that balances exploration and exploitation by generating concurrent trajectories toward exploration-rich goals while collecting informative gas measurements en route. XIT draws batches of samples from an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) information field derived from the current gas posterior and expands trees using a cost that trades off travel effort against gas concentration and uncertainty. To enable plume-aware exploration, we introduce the gas frontier concept, defined as unobserved regions adjacent to high gas concentrations, and propose the Wavefront Gas Frontier Detection (WGFD) algorithm for their identification. High-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the benefits of XIT in terms of GDM quality and efficiency. Although developed for active GDM, XIT is readily applicable to other robotic information-gathering tasks in unknown environments that face the exploration and exploitation trade-off."}

Within the UG approach, the study considers Feature Reassembly Hypothesis (FRH) (Lardiere, 2008, 2009) part of UG, focusing on the roles of first language (L1) transfer and L2 developmental influence. It analyzes learner errors across two developmental stages. Stage 1 data reveal a dominant influence of L1 transfer, particularly in phonological and structural mismatches, while stage 2 data demonstrate increased learner sensitivity to UG properties and morphological reconfiguration toward the target language. Findings reveal that errors in irregular inflectional morphology are attributed to both interlingual and intralingual sources, with overgeneralization of L2 rules as a common developmental strategy. Statistical analysis, including a one-way ANOVA, indicates significant improvement in the production of well-formed irregular inflections from stage 1 to stage 2, underscoring learners' continued access to UG. However, persistent difficulties with consonant change, zero-morpheme, and -a plural inflections suggest that limited exposure, ineffective input modeling, and insufficient instructional quality constrain full UG access.

Most existing approaches perform frame-wise spatial localization within a predicted temporal span, resulting in redundant computation, heavy supervision requirements, and limited generalization. Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner. Following a propose-and-evaluation paradigm, ASTG duly decouples spatio-temporal reasoning and automates the tube extraction, verification and temporal localization processes. With a dedicate visual memory and dialogue context, the retrieval efficiency is significantly enhanced. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach where it outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot approaches by a margin and is comparable to some of the fully-supervised methods."}

Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."}

However, they still struggle to comprehend and respond to the true user needs when intentions and instructions are imprecisely conveyed, leading to a divergence between subjective user believes and true environment states. Resolving this epistemic divergence requires Theory of Mind (ToM), yet existing ToM evaluations for LLMs primarily focus on isolated belief inference, overlooking its functional utility in real-world interaction. To this end, we formalize ToM for LLMs as a mechanism for epistemic divergence detection and resolution, and propose a benchmark, \\benchname, to assess how models reconcile user beliefs and profiles in practice. Results across 11 leading models reveal a significant limitation to identify underlying cognitive gaps that impede task success. To bridge this gap, we further curate a trajectory-based ToM dataset linking belief tracking with task-related state inference. The model trained on this data via reinforcement learning shows consistent improvement in reasoning about user mental states, leading to enhanced downstream performance. Our work highlights the practical value of ToM as an essential interaction-level mechanism rather than as a standalone reasoning skill."}

A rigid impact model is used as the basis for a configuration-dependent metric that quantifies the variation between pre- and post-impact velocities. By finding configurations (postures) that minimize the aforementioned metric, spikes in the robot's state and input commands can be significantly reduced during impacts, improving safety and robustness. The problem of identifying impact-robust postures is posed as a min-max optimization of the aforementioned metric. To overcome the real-time intractability of the problem, we reformulate it as a gradient-based motion task that iteratively guides the robot towards configurations that minimize the proposed metric. This task is embedded within a task-space inverse dynamics (TSID) whole-body controller, enabling seamless integration with other control objectives. The method is applied to a kinematically redundant aerial manipulator performing repeated point contact tasks. We test our method inside a realistic physics simulator and compare it with the nominal TSID. Our method leads to a reduction (up to 51% w.r.t. standard TSID) of post-impact spikes in the robot's configuration and successfully avoids actuator saturation. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of kinematic redundancy for impact robustness using additional numerical simulations on a quadruped and a humanoid robot, resulting in up to 45% reduction of post-impact spikes in the robot's state w.r.t. nominal TSID."}

This relies upon a small draft model, tasked with predicting the outputs of the target model. State-of-the-art speculative decoding methods use a draft model consisting of a single decoder layer and output embedding matrix, with the latter dominating drafting time for the latest LMs. Recent work has sought to address this output distribution bottleneck by reducing the vocabulary of the draft model. Although this can improve throughput, it compromises speculation effectiveness when the target token is out-of-vocabulary. In this paper, we argue for vocabulary speculation as an alternative to a reduced vocabulary. We propose SpecVocab, an efficient and effective method that selects a vocabulary subset per decoding step. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that SpecVocab can achieve a higher acceptance length than state-of-the-art speculative decoding approach, EAGLE-3.

Existing Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) schemes, primarily designed for point-to-point links, suffer from performance saturation in multi-user scenarios.

To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency.

To mitigate these issues, we propose an interpretable clustering method based on optimal multiway-split decision trees, formulated as a 0-1 integer linear optimization problem. This reformulation renders the optimization problem more tractable compared to existing models. A key feature of our method is the integration of a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for the discretization of continuous variables, allowing for flexible and data-driven branching. Extensive numerical experiments on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of clustering accuracy and interpretability. Our method yields multiway-split decision trees with concise decision rules while maintaining competitive performance across various evaluation metrics."}

However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence."}

This paper presents a hybrid framework that blends ontology-based reasoning with large language models (LLMs) to produce semantically grounded and natural robot explanations. Ontologies ensure logical consistency and domain grounding, while LLMs provide fluent, context-aware and adaptive language generation. The proposed method grounds data from human-robot experiences, enabling robots to reason about whether events are typical or atypical based on their properties. We integrate a state-of-the-art algorithm for retrieving and constructing static contrastive ontology-based narratives with an LLM agent that uses them to produce concise, clear, interactive explanations. The approach is validated through a laboratory study replicating an industrial collaborative task. Empirical results show significant improvements in the clarity and brevity of ontology-based narratives while preserving their semantic accuracy. Initial evaluations further demonstrate the system's ability to adapt explanations to user feedback. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ontology-LLM integration to advance explainable agency, and promote more transparent human-robot collaboration."}

Human institutions achieve reliable collective behaviour differently: they mitigate the risk posed by misaligned individuals through organisational structure. Multi-agent AI systems should follow this institutional model using compartmentalisation and adversarial review to achieve reliable outcomes through architectural design rather than assuming individual alignment.\n  We demonstrate this approach through the Perseverance Composition Engine, a multi-agent system for document composition. The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.\n  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components."}

Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel \"Controlled Input\" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs.

This paper identifies and investigates a previously overlooked issue: benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommendation. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs are exposed to and potentially memorize benchmark datasets during pre-training or fine-tuning, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that fail to reflect true model performance. To validate this phenomenon, we simulate diverse data leakage scenarios by conducting continued pre-training of foundation models on strategically blended corpora, which include user-item interactions from both in-domain and out-of-domain sources. Our experiments reveal a dual-effect of data leakage: when the leaked data is domain-relevant, it induces substantial but spurious performance gains, misleadingly exaggerating the model's capability. In contrast, domain-irrelevant leakage typically degrades recommendation accuracy, highlighting the complex and contingent nature of this contamination. Our findings reveal that data leakage acts as a critical, previously unaccounted-for factor in LLM-based recommendation, which could impact the true model performance.

Existing systems run agentic inference by loosely assembling isolated components: an LLM inference engine (e.g., vLLM) and a tool orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes). Although agentic workflows involve multiple LLM and tool requests, these systems schedule and allocate resources separately on a per-request basis, without end-to-end knowledge of the workflow. This leads to sub-optimal management of KV cache and tool execution environments. To address the challenges, we propose ThunderAgent, a fast, simple, and program-aware agentic inference system. We first abstract agentic workflows as LLM Programs, enabling a unified view of heterogeneous resources, including KV caches, system states, and external tool assets such as disk memory and network ports. Built upon this abstraction, ThunderAgent introduces a program-aware scheduler and a tool resource manager designed to maximize KV cache hit rates, mitigate memory imbalances, and enable asynchronous environment preparation. Evaluations across coding, routing, and scientific discovery agents demonstrate that ThunderAgent achieves 1.5-3.6x throughput improvements in serving, 1.8-3.9x in RL rollout, and up to 4.2x disk memory savings compared to state-of-the-art inference systems.

Modern generalist robot policies, such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, often lack the high-fidelity physical grounding required for contact-rich tool manipulation. Conversely, existing contact-aware policies that leverage tactile or haptic sensing are typically instance-specific and fail to generalize across diverse tool geometries. Bridging this gap requires learning unified contact representations from diverse data, yet a fundamental barrier remains: diverse real-world tactile data are prohibitive at scale, while direct zero-shot sim-to-real transfer is challenging due to the complex dynamics of nonlinear deformation of soft sensors.\n  To address this, we propose Semantic-Contact Fields (SCFields), a unified 3D representation fusing visual semantics with dense contact estimates. We enable this via a two-stage Sim-to-Real Contact Learning Pipeline: first, we pre-train on a large simulation data set to learn general contact physics; second, we fine-tune on a small set of real data, pseudo-labeled via geometric heuristics and force optimization, to align sensor characteristics. This allows physical generalization to unseen tools. We leverage SCFields as the dense observation input for a diffusion policy to enable robust execution of contact-rich tool manipulation tasks. Experiments on scraping, crayon drawing, and peeling demonstrate robust category-level generalization, significantly outperforming vision-only and raw-tactile baselines."}

We present BEAGLE, a neuro-symbolic framework that addresses this bias by incorporating Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory into a novel architecture. BEAGLE integrates three key technical innovations: (1) a semi-Markov model that governs the timing and transitions of cognitive behaviors and metacognitive behaviors; (2) Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with explicit flaw injection to enforce realistic knowledge gaps and \"unknown unknowns\"; and (3) a decoupled agent design that separates high-level strategy use from code generation actions to prevent the model from silently correcting its own intentional errors. In evaluations on Python programming tasks, BEAGLE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reproducing authentic trajectories. In a human Turing test, users were unable to distinguish synthetic traces from real student data, achieving an accuracy indistinguishable from random guessing (52.8%)."}

First, we introduce unified motion representations that extract identity-agnostic motions and explicitly bind them to corresponding characters, enabling generalization across diverse humanoid forms and seamless extension to multi-humanoid scenarios. Second, we propose a holistic 4D-anchored paradigm that constructs a shared 4D space to fuse motion representations with video latents, and further reinforces this process with hierarchical 4D-level supervision to better handle interactions and occlusions. We instantiate these ideas in MotionWeaver, an end-to-end framework for multi-humanoid image animation. To support this setting, we curate a 46-hour dataset of multi-human videos with rich interactions, and construct a 300-video benchmark featuring paired humanoid characters. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that MotionWeaver not only achieves state-of-the-art results on our benchmark but also generalizes effectively across diverse humanoid forms, complex interactions, and challenging multi-humanoid scenarios."}

This paper identifies two characteristics in a network, i.e., the distributions of nodes and node degrees that are critical for expressive representation but have been overlooked in existing methods. We show that these overlooked characteristics contribute significantly to over-smoothing of NAS-methods. To address this, we propose a novel weighted distribution-aware kernel that embeds nodes while taking their distributional characteristics into consideration. Our method has three distinguishing features: (1) it is the first method to explicitly incorporate both distributional characteristics; (2) it requires no optimization; and (3) it effectively mitigates the adverse effects of over-smoothing, allowing WL to preserve node distinguishability and expressiveness even after many iterations of embedding. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior community detection performance via spectral clustering, outperforming existing graph embedding methods, including deep learning methods, on standard benchmarks."}

Existing benchmarks neither explicitly distinguish nor comprehensively cover the diverse capabilities required in Doc2Table extraction. We argue that a capability-aware benchmark is essential for systematic evaluation. However, constructing such benchmarks using human-annotated document-table pairs is costly, difficult to scale, and limited in capability coverage. To address this, we adopt a reverse Table2Doc paradigm and design a multi-agent synthesis workflow to generate documents from ground-truth tables.

Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \\textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain.

While widely studied for large language models, the optimization of RAG for Small Language Models (SLMs) remains a critical research gap, particularly in complex, multi-hop question-answering tasks that require sophisticated reasoning. In these systems, prompt template design is a crucial yet under-explored factor influencing performance. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to investigate this factor, evaluating 24 different prompt templates on the HotpotQA dataset. The set includes a standard RAG prompt, nine well-formed techniques from the literature, and 14 novel hybrid variants, all tested on two prominent SLMs: Qwen2.5-3B Instruct and Gemma3-4B-It. Our findings, based on a test set of 18720 instances, reveal significant performance gains of up to 83% on Qwen2.5 and 84.5% on Gemma3-4B-It, yielding an improvement of up to 6% for both models compared to the Standard RAG prompt. This research also offers concrete analysis and actionable recommendations for designing effective and efficient prompts for SLM-based RAG systems, practically for deployment in resource-constrained environments."}

The demand for consistent and defensible decisions under heterogeneous risk profiles exposes limitations in institutional review capacity rather than in the legitimacy of ethics oversight. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to support ethics review, but their direct application remains limited by insufficient ethical reasoning capability, weak integration with regulatory structures, and strict privacy constraints on authentic review materials. In this work, we introduce Mirror, an agentic framework for AI-assisted ethical review that integrates ethical reasoning, structured rule interpretation, and multi-agent deliberation within a unified architecture. At its core is EthicsLLM, a foundational model fine-tuned on EthicsQA, a specialized dataset of 41K question-chain-of-thought-answer triples distilled from authoritative ethics and regulatory corpora. EthicsLLM provides detailed normative and regulatory understanding, enabling Mirror to operate in two complementary modes. Mirror-ER (expedited Review) automates expedited review through an executable rule base that supports efficient and transparent compliance checks for minimal-risk studies. Mirror-CR (Committee Review) simulates full-board deliberation through coordinated interactions among expert agents, an ethics secretary agent, and a principal investigator agent, producing structured, committee-level assessments across ten ethical dimensions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that Mirror significantly improves the quality, consistency, and professionalism of ethics assessments compared with strong generalist LLMs."}

Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance."}

On the other hand, ATR models trained to produce normalized outputs have been shown to struggle to adapt to new domains and tend to over-normalize and hallucinate. We introduce the task of Pre-Editorial Normalization (PEN), which consists in normalizing graphemic ATR output according to editorial conventions, which has the advantage of keeping an intermediate step with palaeographic fidelity while providing a normalized version for practical usability.

To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence. To address the lack of high-fidelity supervision, we build ClinVideoSuite, an evidence-centric, fine-grained clinical video suite. We then optimize MedScope with Grounding-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GA-GRPO), which directly reinforces tool use with grounding-aligned rewards and evidence-weighted advantages. On full and fine-grained video understanding benchmarks, MedScope achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Our approach illuminates a path toward medical AI agents that can genuinely \"think with videos\" through tool-integrated reasoning. We will release our code, models, and data."}

However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds.

When perfect verification is available, we characterize the best possible tradeoff between these requirements and provide a simple parametrized mechanism that is optimal in the class for any distribution of agents' types. When verification is noisy, the task becomes much more challenging. We show how proper scoring rules can be leveraged in different ways to construct truthful mechanisms with a good (though not necessarily optimal) tradeoff."}

In this work, we focus on UAV state estimation anomalies and provide a large-scale real-world UAV dataset to facilitate research aimed at improving the development of anomaly detection. Unlike existing datasets that primarily rely on injected faults into simulated data, this dataset comprises 1396 real flight logs totaling over 52 hours of flight time, collected across diverse indoor and outdoor environments using a collection of PX4-based UAVs equipped with a variety of sensor configurations. The dataset comprises both normal and anomalous flights without synthetic manipulation, making it uniquely suitable for realistic anomaly detection tasks. A structured classification is proposed that categorizes UAV state estimation anomalies into four classes: mechanical and electrical, external position, global position, and altitude anomalies. These classifications reflect collective, contextual, and outlier anomalies observed in multivariate sensor data streams, including IMU, GPS, barometer, magnetometer, distance sensors, visual odometry, and optical flow, that can be found in the PX4 logging mechanism. It is anticipated that this dataset will play a key role in the development, training, and evaluation of anomaly detection and isolation systems to address the critical gap in UAV reliability research."}

To address this challenge, we introduce HLE-Verified, a verified and revised version of HLE with a transparent verification protocol and fine-grained error taxonomy. Our construction follows a two-stage validation-and-repair workflow resulting in a certified benchmark. In Stage I, each item undergoes binary validation of the problem and final answer through domain-expert review and model-based cross-checks, yielding 641 verified items. In Stage II, flawed but fixable items are revised under strict constraints preserving the original evaluation intent, through dual independent expert repairs, model-assisted auditing, and final adjudication, resulting in 1,170 revised-and-certified items. The remaining 689 items are released as a documented uncertain set with explicit uncertainty sources and expertise tags for future refinement. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art language models on HLE and HLE-Verified, observing an average absolute accuracy gain of 7--10 percentage points on HLE-Verified.

First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses.

Traditional diagnosis still relies heavily on medical imaging and clinical assessment by physicians, which is often time-consuming and resource-intensive in terms of both human expertise and healthcare resources. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to the medical field using electronic health records (EHRs), yet their application in Alzheimer's disease assessment remains limited, particularly given that AD involves complex multifactorial etiologies that are difficult to observe directly through imaging modalities. In this work, we propose leveraging LLMs to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning on patients' clinical EHRs. Unlike direct fine-tuning of LLMs on EHR data for AD classification, our approach utilizes LLM-generated CoT reasoning paths to provide the model with explicit diagnostic rationale for AD assessment, followed by structured CoT-based predictions. This pipeline not only enhances the model's ability to diagnose intrinsically complex factors but also improves the interpretability of the prediction process across different stages of AD progression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CoT-based diagnostic framework significantly enhances stability and diagnostic performance across multiple CDR grading tasks, achieving up to a 15% improvement in F1 score compared to the zero-shot baseline method."}

Experiments across Qwen2-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mistral-7B validate our theoretical predictions, showing empirical distortion tracks the linear trend with deviations consistently within $O(\\sqrt{T})$ envelopes. Key findings include: semantic weighting reduces distortion by 80\\%, and periodic re-grounding approximately every 9 steps suffices for error control. We translate these concentration guarantees into actionable deployment principles for trustworthy agent systems."}

Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making."}

However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%."}

In this setting, two robots operate over predefined roadmaps, each represented as a graph corresponding to its configuration space. One robot, the task robot, must execute a timed mission, while the other, the assistance robot, provides sensor-based support that depends on their spatial relationship. The objective is to compute a path for both robots that maximizes the total duration of assistance given. Solving this problem is challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible path combinations together with the temporal nature of the problem (time needs to be accounted for as well). To address this, we propose a nested branch-and-bound framework that efficiently explores the space of robot paths in a hierarchical manner. We empirically evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude when compared to a baseline approach."}

Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation.

Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems."}

However, current approaches rely heavily on static sociodemographic and infrastructure metrics, frequently overlooking the impacts from drivers' visual perception of driving environment. Although visual environment features have been found to impact driving and traffic crashes, existing evidence remains largely observational, failing to establish the robust causality for traffic policy evaluation under complex spatial environment. To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs."}

Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy.

This confluence maintains analytic-learning's extreme efficiency while overcoming its inherent brittleness. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that VILA consistently yields superior performance, particularly in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios.

It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings."}

Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points).

We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning."}

Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance. We present ablation studies evaluating each constraint alone and jointly across CNNs, MLPs, Liquid Time Constant models, and Contiformers. Continuous-time dynamics and long-term memory are critical for modelling magnetic time series; the Contiformer architecture, which provides both, outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To mitigate data scarcity, we generate synthetic datasets using the World Magnetic Model (WMM) with time-series conditional GANs, producing realistic, temporally consistent magnetic sequences across varied trajectories and environments. Experiments show that embedding these constraints significantly improves predictive accuracy and physical plausibility, outperforming classical and unconstrained deep learning approaches."}

A central coordinator can regulate aggregate pushback capacity but cannot directly control which specific aircraft are released, limiting its ability to steer system-level performance. We propose a noncooperative coordination mechanism for collaborative virtual queueing based on the correlated equilibrium concept, which enables the coordinator to provide incentive-compatible recommendations on aircraft-level pushback decisions without overriding airline autonomy. To account for uncertainty in airlines' internal cost assessments, we introduce chance constraints into the correlated equilibrium formulation. This formulation provides explicit probabilistic guarantees on incentive compatibility, allowing the coordinator to adjust the confidence level with which airlines are expected to follow the recommended actions. We further propose a scalable algorithm for computing chance-constrained correlated equilibria by exploiting a reduced-rank structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method scales to realistic traffic levels up to 210 eligible pushbacks per hour, reduces accumulated delay by up to approximately 8.9% compared to current first-come-first-served schemes, and reveals a trade-off between confidence level, deviation robustness, and achievable cost efficiency."}

Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0.

This assumption is shown to be inconsistent with the geometry of expert representations. Geometric analysis of a modern MoE embedding model reveals that expert outputs lie on a shared hyperspherical manifold characterized by tightly concentrated norms and substantial angular separation. Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability. Additional geometric analyses confirm that SBA prevents aggregation-induced collapse and preserves hyperspherical consistency, highlighting the importance of geometry-aware aggregation in MoE embedding architectures."}

To evaluate the framework, three benchmark tests were designed, each consisting of ten questions. In the first benchmark test, the framework was evaluated while connected to GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3.2, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5, as well as their corresponding raw models. The objective was to extract the forward kinematics of robots directly from textual descriptions. The results showed that the framework integrated with GPT-4o achieved the highest accuracy, reaching 0.97 in computing the final solution, whereas the raw model alone attained an accuracy of only 0.30 for the same task.

We present \\emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \\emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \\emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction."}

We find that LLMs exhibit non-trivial parametric knowledge of factual claims and that their verification accuracy generally declines as context length increases. Similarly to what has been shown in previous works, in-context evidence placement plays a critical role with accuracy being consistently higher when relevant evidence appears near the beginning or end of the prompt and lower when placed mid-context.

Recent methods add multi-reward objectives to jointly optimize correctness and brevity, but these complex extensions often destabilize training and yield suboptimal trade-offs. We revisit this objective and challenge the necessity of such complexity. Through principled analysis, we identify fundamental misalignments in this paradigm: KL regularization loses its intended role when correctness and length are directly verifiable, and group-wise normalization becomes ambiguous under multiple reward signals. By removing these two items and simplifying the reward to a truncation-based length penalty, we show that the optimization problem reduces to supervised fine-tuning on self-generated data filtered for both correctness and conciseness. We term this simplified training strategy on-policy SFT. Despite its simplicity, on-policy SFT consistently defines the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier. It reduces CoT length by up to 80 while maintaining original accuracy, surpassing more complex RL-based methods across five benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly enhances training efficiency, reducing GPU memory usage by 50% and accelerating convergence by 70%. Our code is available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/On-Policy-SFT."}

Unlike multi-arm platforms with gripper end effectors, multi-fingered hands rely solely on fingertip point contacts and are not able to apply pull forces, therefore poses a more challenging problem. Furthermore, calibrated torque sensors are lacking in most commercial dexterous hands, adding to the difficulty. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-layer framework for multi-finger coordination, enabling high-precision manipulation of force-sensitive objects through joint control without tactile feedback. This approach solves coordinated contact force planning by incorporating graph rigidity and force closure constraints. By employing a force-to-position mapping, the planned force trajectory is converted to a joint trajectory. We validate the framework on a custom dexterous hand, demonstrating the capability to manipulate fragile objects-including a soft yarn, a plastic cup, and a raw egg-with high precision and safety."}

Empirically, we demonstrate that 1) the clustering strategy enables fine-grained expert specialization with nearly 10% improvement in definition quality; 2) the semantic-aware domain-level routing mechanism achieves higher expert efficacy (+1%) than conventional token-level routing; and 3) further performance gains can be obtained through test-time compute and semantic expert scaling. Our work advances definition modeling while providing insights into the development of efficient language models for semantic-intensive applications."}

Prior work has examined the safety and misuse risks associated with agents. However, much of this has focused on the single-agent case and/or setups missing basic engineering safeguards such as access control, revealing a scarcity of threat modeling in multi-agent systems. We investigate the security vulnerabilities of a popular multi-agent pattern known as the orchestrator setup, in which a central agent decomposes and delegates tasks to specialized agents. Through red-teaming a concrete setup representative of a likely future use case, we demonstrate a novel attack vector, OMNI-LEAK, that compromises several agents to leak sensitive data through a single indirect prompt injection, even in the \\textit{presence of data access control}. We report the susceptibility of frontier models to different categories of attacks, finding that both reasoning and non-reasoning models are vulnerable, even when the attacker lacks insider knowledge of the implementation details. Our work highlights the importance of safety research to generalize from single-agent to multi-agent settings, in order to reduce the serious risks of real-world privacy breaches and financial losses and overall public trust in AI agents."}

We introduce \\textbf{AdaCorrection}, an adaptive offset cache correction framework that maintains high generation fidelity while enabling efficient cache reuse across Transformer layers during diffusion inference. At each timestep, AdaCorrection estimates cache validity with lightweight spatio-temporal signals and adaptively blends cached and fresh activations. This correction is computed on-the-fly without additional supervision or retraining. Our approach achieves strong generation quality with minimal computational overhead, maintaining near-original FID while providing moderate acceleration.

While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms."}

While existing methods often rely on costly real-world data or utilize blind compliance through fixed controllers, we propose a framework that leverages expert-designed controller logic for transfer. Inspired by the success of privileged supervision in kinematic tasks, we employ a human-designed finite state machine based position/force controller in simulation to provide privileged guidance. The resulting policy is trained to predict the end-effector pose, contact state, and crucially the desired contact force direction. Unlike force magnitudes, which are highly sensitive to simulation inaccuracies, force directions encode high-level task geometry and remain robust across the sim-to-real gap. At deployment, these predictions configure a force-aware admittance controller. By combining the policy's directional intent with a constant, low-cost manually tuned force magnitude, the system generates adaptive, task-aligned compliance. This tuning is lightweight, typically requiring only a single scalar per contact state. We provide theoretical analysis for stability and robustness to disturbances. Experiments on four real-world tasks, i.e., microwave opening, peg-in-hole, whiteboard wiping, and door opening, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines in both success rate and robustness.

Traditional methods relying on statistical independence assumptions or CNN/GAN variants struggle to characterize complex feature distributions in real scenes, leading to estimation bias, texture distortion, and artifact residue under strong noise and nonlinear mixing. This paper innovatively introduces diffusion models into dual-channel BIS, proposing an efficient Dual-Channel Diffusion Separation Model (DCDSM). DCDSM leverages diffusion models' powerful generative capability to learn source image feature distributions and reconstruct feature structures effectively. A novel Wavelet Suppression Module (WSM) is designed within the dual-branch reverse denoising process, forming an interactive separation network that enhances detail separation by exploiting the mutual coupling noise characteristic between source images. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets containing rain/snow and complex mixtures demonstrate that DCDSM achieves state-of-the-art performance: 1) In image restoration tasks, it obtains PSNR/SSIM values of 35.0023 dB/0.9549 and 29.8108 dB/0.9243 for rain and snow removal respectively, outperforming Histoformer and LDRCNet by 1.2570 dB/0.9272 dB (PSNR) and 0.0262/0.0289 (SSIM) on average; 2) For complex mixture separation, the restored dual-source images achieve average PSNR and SSIM of 25.0049 dB and 0.7997, surpassing comparative methods by 4.1249 dB and 0.0926.

This barrier limits the integrated and computationally scaleable operation optimization of industrial thermal power systems. To address this issue for large-scale engineering systems, we present a fully machine learning-powered bi-level optimization framework for data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems. The objective functions of upper and lower levels are approximated by artificial neural network (ANN) models and the lower-level problem is analytically embedded through Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The reformulated single level optimization framework integrating ANN models and KKT constraints (ANN-KKT) is validated on benchmark problems and on real-world power generation operation of 660 MW coal power plant and 395 MW gas turbine system. The results reveal a comparable solutions obtained from the proposed ANN-KKT framework to the bi-level solutions of the benchmark problems. Marginal computational time requirement (0.22 to 0.88 s) to compute optimal solutions yields 583 MW (coal) and 402 MW (gas turbine) of power output at optimal turbine heat rate of 7337 kJ/kWh and 7542 kJ/kWh, respectively. In addition, the method expands to delineate a feasible and robust operating envelope that accounts for uncertainty in operating variables while maximizing thermal efficiency in various scenarios. These results demonstrate that ANN-KKT offers a scalable and computationally efficient route for hierarchical, data-driven optimization of industrial thermal power systems, achieving energy-efficient operations of large-scale engineering systems and contributing to industry 5.0."}

Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries.

A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

We argue that robust alignment for non-verifiable tasks is fundamentally a principle generalization problem: reward should not be a learned function internalized into a judge, but an explicit reasoning process executed under inspectable principles. To operationalize this view, we present the Open Rubric System (OpenRS), a plug-and-play, rubrics-based LLM-as-a-Judge framework built around Pairwise Adaptive Meta-Rubrics (PAMR) and lightweight Pointwise Verifiable Rubrics (PVRs), which provide both hard-constraint guardrails and verifiable reward components when ground-truth or programmatic checks are available. OpenRS uses an explicit meta-rubric -- a constitution-like specification that governs how rubrics are instantiated, weighted, and enforced -- and instantiates adaptive rubrics on the fly by conditioning on the semantic differences between two candidate responses. It then performs criterion-wise pairwise comparisons and aggregates criterion-level preferences externally, avoiding pointwise weighted scalarization while improving discriminability in open-ended settings. To keep principles consistent yet editable across various domains, we introduce a two-level meta-rubric refinement pipeline (automated evolutionary refinement for general principles and a reproducible human-in-the-loop procedure for domain principles), complemented with pointwise verifiable rubrics that act as both guardrails against degenerate behaviors and a source of verifiable reward for objective sub-tasks.

Unlike standard LLMs answering questions in a controlled ChatBot setting, web agents act \"in the wild\", interacting with third parties and leaving behind an action trace. Therefore, we ask the question: how do web agents handle user resources when accomplishing tasks on their behalf across live websites? In this paper, we formalize Natural Agentic Oversharing -- the unintentional disclosure of task-irrelevant user information through an agent trace of actions on the web. We introduce SPILLage, a framework that characterizes oversharing along two dimensions: channel (content vs. behavior) and directness (explicit vs. implicit). This taxonomy reveals a critical blind spot: while prior work focuses on text leakage, web agents also overshare behaviorally through clicks, scrolls, and navigation patterns that can be monitored. We benchmark 180 tasks on live e-commerce sites with ground-truth annotations separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant attributes. Across 1,080 runs spanning two agentic frameworks and three backbone LLMs, we demonstrate that oversharing is pervasive with behavioral oversharing dominates content oversharing by 5x. This effect persists -- and can even worsen -- under prompt-level mitigation. However, removing task-irrelevant information before execution improves task success by up to 17.9%, demonstrating that reducing oversharing improves task success.

We show that the limited torque of the motors and the nonlinear aerodynamic map from rotor speed to thrust naturally give rise to the novel concept of promptness-a metric akin to dynamic aerodynamic manipulability. By treating energy consumption as a competing objective and introducing a geometric fiber-bundle formulation, we turn redundancy resolution into a principled multi-objective program on affine fibers. The use of the diffeomorphic transformation linearizing the signed-quadratic propulsion model allows us to lay the foundations for a rigorous study of the interplay between these costs. Through an illustrative case study on 4-DoF allocation on the hexarotor, we reveal that this interplay is fiber-dependent and physically shaped by hardware inequalities. For unidirectional thrusters, the feasible fibers are compact, yielding interior allocations and a short Pareto arc, while torque demands break symmetry and separate the optima. Conversely, with reversible propellers, the null space enables antagonistic rotor co-contraction that drives promptness to hardware limits, making optimal endurance and agility fundamentally incompatible in those regimes. Ultimately, rather than relying on heuristic tuning or black box algorithms to empirically improve task execution, this framework provides a foundational understanding of why and how to achieve agility through geometry-aware control allocation, offering possible guidance for vehicle design, certification metrics, and threat-aware flight operation."}

In contrast, memory in language agents remains mainly semantic, and current agents are not yet capable of effectively recollecting and reasoning over interaction histories. We identify and formalize the core challenges of episodic recollection and reasoning from this gap, and observe that existing work often overlooks episodicity, lacks explicit event modeling, or overemphasizes simple retrieval rather than complex reasoning. We present REMem, a two-phase framework for constructing and reasoning with episodic memory: 1) Offline indexing, where REMem converts experiences into a hybrid memory graph that flexibly links time-aware gists and facts. 2) Online inference, where REMem employs an agentic retriever with carefully curated tools for iterative retrieval over the memory graph. Comprehensive evaluation across four episodic memory benchmarks shows that REMem substantially outperforms state-of-the-art memory systems such as Mem0 and HippoRAG 2, showing 3.4% and 13.4% absolute improvements on episodic recollection and reasoning tasks, respectively. Moreover, REMem also demonstrates more robust refusal behavior for unanswerable questions."}

This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework.

To mitigate this redundancy, we propose Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS), a novel framework with two variants. CRDS-R applies Rademacher random projection followed by concatenation of transformer hidden-layer representations, while CRDS-W employs whitening-based dimensionality reduction to improve representational quality. Experimental results demonstrate that both variants substantially enhance data quality and consistently outperform state-of-the-art representation-based selection methods.

Inter-agent connectivity, even if intermittent (i.e. sparse), enables data exchanges between agents and supports cooperative behaviours in several NART missions. It can benefit online decentralised decision-making and group resilience, particularly when prior knowledge is inaccurate or incomplete. These requirements can be accounted for in the offline mission planning stages to incentivise cooperative behaviours and improve mission efficiency during the NART deployment. This paper proposes a novel path planning tool for a Sparse, Aware, and Cooperative Networked Aerial Robot Team (SpArC-NART) in exploration missions. It simultaneously considers different levels of prior information regarding the environment, limited agent energy, sensing, and communication, as well as distinct NART constitutions. The communication model takes into account the limitations of user-defined radio technology and physical phenomena. The proposed tool aims to maximise the mission goals (e.g., finding one or multiple targets, covering the full area of the environment, etc.), while cooperating with other agents to reduce agent reporting times, increase their global situational awareness (e.g., their knowledge of the environment), and facilitate mission replanning, if required. The developed cooperation mechanism leverages soft-motion constraints and dynamic rewards based on the Value of Movement and the expected communication availability between the agents at each time step. A ground sensing coverage use case was chosen to illustrate the current capabilities of this tool."}

While these methods increase trajectory diversity, their exploration behavior is not explicitly modeled and can be inefficient under finite sampling budgets. We observe that stronger perturbations do not necessarily translate into more effective candidate trajectories, as unguided noise may disrupt internal decision structure rather than steer it. To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen. Experiments on GSM8K with two latent reasoning architectures show that GTS achieves more reliable inference-time scaling than heuristic baselines. These findings indicate that improving latent ITS requires structured and optimizable exploration mechanisms rather than simply amplifying stochasticity."}

In this paper, we propose a robust Online Reinforcement Learning WebAgent, designed to optimize its policy through direct, iterative interactions with unconstrained wide websites. Our approach comprises three core innovations: 1) Hierarchical Multi-Task Fine-tuning: We curate a comprehensive mixture of datasets categorized by functional primitives -- Planning, Acting, and Grounding -- establishing a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with strong instruction-following capabilities for Web GUI tasks. 2) Online Agentic RL in the Wild: We develop an online interaction environment and fine-tune the VLM using a specialized RL pipeline. We introduce a Hybrid Reward Mechanism that combines a ground-truth-agnostic WebJudge for holistic outcome assessment with a Rule-based Decision Tree (RDT) for progress reward.

Current solutions are primarily constrained by two paradigms: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), which improves short-term domain fitting but frequently disrupts previously learned global temporal patterns due to catastrophic forgetting; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates external knowledge but introduces substantial retrieval overhead. This creates a severe scalability bottleneck that fails to meet the high-efficiency requirements of real-time stream processing. To break this impasse, we propose Memory for Time Series (MEMTS), a lightweight and plug-and-play method for retrieval-free domain adaptation in time series forecasting. The key component of MEMTS is a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM), which internalizes domain-specific temporal dynamics, such as recurring seasonal patterns and trends into a compact set of learnable latent prototypes. In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations. This paradigm shift enables MEMTS to achieve accurate domain adaptation with constant-time inference and near-zero latency, while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general temporal patterns, all without requiring any architectural modifications to the frozen TSFM backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of MEMTS."}

While learning-based visuomotor policies offer a promising alternative to open-loop control, their deployment on industrial platforms is challenged by a large observation-execution gap caused by sensing, inference, and control latency. This gap is significantly greater than on low-latency research robots due to high-level interfaces and slower closed-loop dynamics, making execution timing a critical system-level issue. This paper presents a latency-aware framework for deploying and evaluating visuomotor policies on industrial robotic arms under realistic timing constraints. The framework integrates calibrated multimodal sensing, temporally consistent synchronization, a unified communication pipeline, and a teleoperation interface for demonstration collection. Within this framework, we introduce a latency-aware execution strategy that schedules finite-horizon, policy-predicted action sequences based on temporal feasibility, enabling asynchronous inference and execution without modifying policy architectures or training. We evaluate the framework on a contact-rich industrial assembly task while systematically varying inference latency. Using identical policies and sensing pipelines, we compare latency-aware execution with blocking and naive asynchronous baselines. Results show that latency-aware execution maintains smooth motion, compliant contact behavior, and consistent task progression across a wide range of latencies while reducing idle time and avoiding instability observed in baseline methods. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly handling latency for reliable closed-loop deployment of visuomotor policies on industrial robots."}

We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode."}

In a second experiment, we introduce direct disagreement between a single human and a single LLM. Across tasks, models conform significantly more to responses labeled as coming from human experts, including when that signal is incorrect, and revise their answers toward experts more readily than toward other LLMs. These results reveal that expert framing acts as a strong prior for contemporary LLMs, suggesting a form of credibility-sensitive social influence that generalizes across decision domains."}

Despite recent progress, such formulations often struggle in complex and evolving settings, largely because most forecasting models lack the ability to autonomously acquire informative evidence, reason about potential future changes, or revise predictions through iterative decision processes. In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning. Building on this formulation, forecasting is carried out through a tool-augmented agentic workflow, in which the agent autonomously interacts with a modular toolkit to extract statistical features, invoke lightweight forecasting models for decision support, perform reasoning-based prediction, and iteratively refine forecasts through self-reflection. To train Cast-R1, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy that combines supervised fine-tuning with multi-turn reinforcement learning, together with a curriculum learning scheme that progressively increases task difficulty to improve policy learning. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Cast-R1. We hope this work provides a practical step towards further exploration of agentic paradigms for time series modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/Xiaoyu-Tao/Cast-R1-TS."}

A ground plane mosaic is then constructed via homography transforms and matched to satellite imagery using a sum of squares differences (SSD) of intensities. Experimental results reveal that drift within the SfM solution, similar to that observed in dead-reckoning systems, challenges the expected accuracy benefits of map-matching with a wide-baseline ground-plane mosaic.

Recent work has shown that encoder-decoder models can acquire irregular patterns, but evidence that they generalize these patterns like humans is mixed. We investigate this using the Spanish \\emph{L-shaped morphome}, where only the first-person singular indicative (e.g., \\textit{pongo} `I put') shares its stem with all subjunctive forms (e.g., \\textit{ponga, pongas}) despite lacking apparent phonological, semantic, or syntactic motivation. We compare five encoder-decoder transformers varying along two dimensions: sequential vs. position-invariant positional encoding, and atomic vs. decomposed tag representations. Positional encoding proves decisive: position-invariant models recover the correct L-shaped paradigm clustering even when L-shaped verbs are scarce in training, whereas sequential positional encoding models only partially capture the pattern. Yet none of the models productively generalize this pattern to novel forms. Position-invariant models generalize the L-shaped stem across subjunctive cells but fail to extend it to the first-person singular indicative, producing a mood-based generalization rather than the L-shaped morphomic pattern. Humans do the opposite, generalizing preferentially to the first-person singular indicative over subjunctive forms. None of the models reproduce the human pattern, highlighting the gap between statistical pattern reproduction and morphological abstraction."}

The workflow uses wiring-diagram decompositions of claim dependencies to localize gaps and coordinate reviewer-driven revisions. Final outcomes are heterogeneous but explicit: the manuscript distinguishes mathematical status from QC-validation status. Mathematically, Problem~3 has a validation-complete existence path under the scoped criterion used here (uniqueness/irreducibility treated as optional), Problem 5 is solved in a scope-limited form for $F_O$-local connective spectra, Problem 10 is conditional under clearly stated assumptions (with explicit necessity counterexamples when assumptions are dropped), and Problems 4 and 6 are partial with named remaining obligations in the general case (including an unconditional $K_n$ result for Problem 6 with $c_0 = 1/3$). Problem 7 is treated as provisionally closed via the rotation-route theorem chain, pending independent ledger re-check. At the QC layer, Problems~7 and~9 have node-level validation artifacts but still contain unresolved verifier gaps. The main methodological result is that structure-aware verification and layer-switching strategies improve reliability and calibration in compressed proof sprints."}

While traditional approaches rely on handcrafted features mimicking clinical scales, recent advances in video foundation models (VFMs) enable representation learning without task-specific customization. However, the comparative effectiveness of different VFM architectures across diverse clinical tasks remains poorly understood. We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%. While high specificity (up to 90.3%) suggests strong potential for ruling out healthy individuals, the lower sensitivity (43.2-57.3%) highlights the need for task-aware calibration and integration of multiple tasks and modalities. Overall, this work establishes a rigorous baseline for VFM-based PD screening and provides a roadmap for selecting suitable tasks and architectures in remote neurological monitoring.

The proposed framework consists of three coupled components: (1) a recurrent object state estimator that tracks the manipulated object in real time under limited field-of-view and occlusions; (2) a whole-body base policy for robust locomotion with residual manipulation control for stable object lifting and delivery; and (3) a LiDAR-based robot global position estimator that provides drift-robust localization. All components are trained in simulation using reinforcement learning and deployed on real hardware in a zero-shot manner.

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI."}

(2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them?

However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework. Extensive experiments across diverse settings demonstrate that AnomaMind consistently improves anomaly detection performance. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AnomaMind."}

This study introduces CLAW (Compliant Leaf-spring Anisotropic soft Wrist), a novel soft wrist mechanism that addresses these limitations through a simple yet effective design using two orthogonal leaf springs and rotary joints with a locking mechanism. CLAW provides large 6-degree-of-freedom deformation (40mm lateral, 20mm vertical), anisotropic stiffness that is tunable across three distinct modes, while maintaining lightweight construction (330g) at low cost ($550). Experimental evaluations using imitation learning demonstrate that CLAW achieves 76% success rate in benchmark peg-insertion tasks, outperforming both the Fin Ray gripper (43%) and rigid gripper alternatives (36%). CLAW successfully handles diverse contact-rich scenarios, including precision assembly with tight tolerances and delicate object manipulation, demonstrating its potential to enable robust robot learning in contact-rich domains.

However, this \"pre-ingestion\" approach is costly (a 113-page engineering drawing package requires approximately 80,000 VLM tokens), end-to-end unreliable (VLM outputs may fail to be correctly retrieved due to format mismatches in the retrieval infrastructure), and irrecoverable once it fails. This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression). DVI also supports interactive refinement and progressive caching, transforming the \"QA accuracy\" problem into a \"page localization\" problem--once the correct drawing page is found, obtaining the answer becomes a matter of interaction rounds."}

We reveal a 'quantization trap' where reducing precision from 16-bit to 8/4-bit paradoxically increases more net energy consumption while degrading reasoning accuracy. We provide a rigorous theoretical decomposition that attributes this failure to hardware casting overhead, the hidden latency cost of dequantization kernels, which becomes a dominant bottleneck in sequential reasoning chains, as well as to a sequential energy amortization failure. As a result, scaling law breaking is unavoidable in practice.

Recent methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved photorealistic modeling in autonomous driving scene reconstruction, but they primarily focus on normal-light conditions. Low-light driving scenes are more challenging to model due to their complex lighting and appearance conditions, which often causes performance degradation of existing methods. To address this problem, this work presents a novel approach that integrates physically based rendering into 3DGS to enhance nighttime scene reconstruction for autonomous driving. Specifically, our approach integrates physically based rendering into composite scene Gaussian representations and jointly optimizes Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) based material properties. We explicitly model diffuse components through a global illumination module and specular components by anisotropic spherical Gaussians. As a result, our approach improves reconstruction quality for outdoor nighttime driving scenes, while maintaining real-time rendering. Extensive experiments across diverse nighttime scenarios on two real-world autonomous driving datasets, including nuScenes and Waymo, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively."}

In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness.

This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection.

Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end.

Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible."}

In this project, we employed a two-stage end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to optimize a robot's performance on U-shaped stairs. The training robot-dog modality, Unitree Go2, was first trained to climb stairs on Isaac Lab's pyramid-stair terrain, and then to climb a U-shaped indoor staircase using the learned policies. This project explores end-to-end RL methods that enable robot dogs to autonomously climb stairs. The results showed (1) the successful goal reached for robot dogs climbing U-shaped stairs with a stall penalty, and (2) the transferability from the policy trained on U-shaped stairs to deployment on straight, L-shaped, and spiral stair terrains, and transferability from other stair models to deployment on U-shaped terrain."}

In scientific settings, however, unsupported or uncertain conclusions can be more harmful than abstaining. We study this problem through an abstention-aware verification framework that decomposes scientific claims into minimal conditions, audits each condition against available evidence using natural language inference (NLI), and selectively decides whether to support, refute, or abstain. We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer. This work highlights abstention-aware evaluation as a practical and model-agnostic lens for assessing scientific reliability, and provides a unified experimental basis for future work on selective reasoning in scientific domains.

However, in heterogeneous multi-agent systems (HMAS), capability differences among agents give rise to consistent cognitive problems, where strong and weak models fail to contribute effectively. We define the collaboration as a strong-weak system. Through comprehensive experiments, we disclose a counterintuitive phenomenon in the strong-weak system: a strong-weak collaboration may under-perform weak-weak combinations, revealing that cognitive mismatching are key bottlenecks limiting heterogeneous cooperation. To overcome these challenges, we propose an Entropy-Based Adaptive Guidance Framework that dynamically aligns the guidance with the cognitive state of each agent. The framework quantifies the understanding of weak agents through multi-dimensional entropy metrics - covering expression, uncertainty, structure, coherence, and relevance - and adaptively adjusts the intensity of the guidance at light, moderate and intensive levels. Furthermore, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism is incorporated to retain successful collaboration experiences, enabling both immediate adaptation and long-term learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, GSM8K, MBPP, and CVRP demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances the effectiveness and stability of heterogeneous collaboration. The results highlight that adaptive guidance not only mitigates cognitive imbalance but also establishes a scalable pathway toward more robust, cooperative multi-agent intelligence."}

To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing.

Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.\n  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector."}

Our approach replaces TWISTED's single-step inverse model that was learned via supervised learning with a multi-step Reinforcement Learning policy conditioned on abstract topological actions rather than goal states. This change allows more delicate topological state transitions while avoiding costly and ineffective data collection protocols, thus enabling better generalization across diverse knot configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that TWISTED-RL manages to solve previously unattainable knots of higher complexity, including commonly used knots such as the Figure-8 and the Overhand. Furthermore, the increase in success rates and drop in planning time establishes TWISTED-RL as the new state-of-the-art in robotic knot-tying without human demonstrations."}

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales."}

TwInS adopts a unified, general-purpose architecture in which multi-level contextual features from the scene parsing stream are infused into the geometric vision stream to guide its iterative refinement. In the reverse direction, decoded geometric features are projected into the contextual feature space for selective heterogeneous feature fusion via a novel cross-task adapter, which leverages rich cross-view geometric cues to enhance scene parsing.

We present \\texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \\texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \\textit{Demography, Age, Site \\& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts.

Common approaches rely on prediction-based planning or risk-aware control, but these are typically treated in isolation, limiting their ability to capture the coupled nature of action and inference in interactive settings. This gap becomes especially critical in uncertain scenarios, where simply reacting to predictions can lead to unsafe maneuvers or overly conservative behavior. Our central insight is that safe interaction requires not only estimating human behavior but also shaping it when ambiguity poses risks. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical belief model that structures human behavior across coarse discrete intents and fine motion modes, updated via Bayesian inference for interpretable multi-resolution reasoning. On top of this, we develop an active probing strategy that identifies when multimodal ambiguity in human predictions may compromise safety and plans disambiguating actions that both reveal intent and gently steer human decisions toward safer outcomes. Finally, a runtime risk-evaluation layer based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) ensures that all probing actions remain within human risk tolerance during influence. Our simulations in lane-merging and unsignaled intersection scenarios demonstrate that our approach achieves higher success rates and shorter completion times compared to existing methods. These results highlight the benefit of coupling belief inference, probing, and risk monitoring, yielding a principled and interpretable framework for planning under uncertainty."}

To address this gap, we propose AD-Bench, a benchmark designed based on real-world business requirements of advertising and marketing platforms. AD-Bench is constructed from real user marketing analysis requests, with domain experts providing verifiable reference answers and corresponding reference tool-call trajectories. The benchmark categorizes requests into three difficulty levels (L1-L3) to evaluate agents' capabilities under multi-round, multi-tool collaboration. Experiments show that on AD-Bench, Gemini-3-Pro achieves Pass@1 = 68.0% and Pass@3 = 83.0%, but performance drops significantly on L3 to Pass@1 = 49.4% and Pass@3 = 62.1%, with a trajectory coverage of 70.1%, indicating that even state-of-the-art models still exhibit substantial capability gaps in complex advertising and marketing analysis scenarios.

This paper identifies and addresses three key redundancies: (1) the redundant processing of a large library of function descriptions for every request; (2) the redundant use of a large, slow model to generate an entire, often predictable, token sequence; and (3) the redundant generation of fixed, boilerplate parameter syntax. We introduce HyFunc, a novel framework that systematically eliminates these inefficiencies. HyFunc employs a hybrid-model cascade where a large model distills user intent into a single \"soft token.\" This token guides a lightweight retriever to select relevant functions and directs a smaller, prefix-tuned model to generate the final call, thus avoiding redundant context processing and full-sequence generation by the large model. To eliminate syntactic redundancy, our \"dynamic templating\" technique injects boilerplate parameter syntax on-the-fly within an extended vLLM engine. To avoid potential limitations in generalization, we evaluate HyFunc on an unseen benchmark dataset, BFCL. Experimental results demonstrate that HyFunc achieves an excellent balance between efficiency and performance. It achieves an inference latency of 0.828 seconds, outperforming all baseline models, and reaches a performance of 80.1%, surpassing all models with a comparable parameter scale.

Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step. Specifically, we introduce Visual Grounding Entropy (VGE) to estimate hallucination risk, which leverages visual grounding as a complementary signal to capture evidence mismatches beyond entropy. Guided by VGE, AdaVBoost applies stronger visual attention boosting to high-risk tokens and weaker boosting to low-risk tokens, enabling token-level adaptive intervention at each generation step.

In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization."}

Nevertheless, VLM-based approaches still suffer from hallucinated reasoning and an inability to anticipate physical execution failures. To address these challenges, we propose an HRC framework that augments a VLM-based reasoning with a dual-correction mechanism: an internal correction model that verifies logical consistency and task feasibility prior to action execution, and an external correction model that detects and rectifies physical failures through post-execution feedback. Simulation ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves the success rate compared to baselines without correction models. Our real-world experiments in collaborative assembly tasks supported by object fixation or tool preparation by an upper body humanoid robot further confirm the framewor's effectiveness in enabling interactive replanning across different collaborative tasks in response to human instructions, validating its practical feasibility."}

By analyzing the static embedding spaces of 11 transformer models spanning encoder (BERT, RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, ALBERT, MiniLM, DistilBERT) and decoder (GPT-2) architectures, we identify three operationally distinct hallucination types: Type 1 (center-drift) under weak context, Type 2 (wrong-well convergence) to locally coherent but contextually incorrect cluster regions, and Type 3 (coverage gaps) where no cluster structure exists. We introduce three measurable geometric statistics: α (polarity coupling), \\b{eta} (cluster cohesion), and λ_s (radial information gradient). Across all 11 models, polarity structure (α > 0.5) is universal (11/11), cluster cohesion (\\b{eta} > 0) is universal (11/11), and the radial information gradient is significant (9/11, p < 0.05). We demonstrate that the two models failing λ_s significance -- ALBERT and MiniLM -- do so for architecturally explicable reasons: factorized embedding compression and distillation-induced isotropy, respectively.

The proposed method integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with parameterizable robot skills in a physics-based simulation environment. To realistically model the snap-fit assembly process, we develop and evaluate two types of joining models: analytical models based on beam theory and rigid-body models implemented in the MuJoCo physics engine. These models enable accurate simulation of interaction forces, essential for training DRL agents. The robot skills are structured using the pitasc framework, allowing modular, reusable control strategies. Training is conducted in simulation using Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithms. Domain randomization is applied to improve robustness. The trained policies are transferred to a physical UR10e robot system without additional tuning. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates (up to 100%) in both simulation and real-world settings, even under significant positional and rotational deviations. The system generalizes well to new terminal types and positions, significantly reducing manual programming effort. This work highlights the potential of combining simulation-based learning with modular robot skills for flexible, scalable automation in small-batch manufacturing. Future work will explore hybrid learning methods, automated environment parameterization, and further refinement of joining models for design integration."}

Moreover, existing ITC methods offer limited control over how to perform reasoning, which in turn limits their explainability. We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them. Together, these results establish STATe as a practical framework for generating high-quality, diverse, and interpretable text.

However, long-horizon multi-step tool planning is challenging, because the exploration space suffers from a combinatorial explosion. In this scenario, even when a correct tool-use path is found, it is usually considered an immediate reward for current training, which would not provide any reusable information for subsequent training. In this paper, we argue that historically successful trajectories contain reusable tool-transition patterns, which can be leveraged throughout the whole training process. Inspired by ant colony optimization where historically successful paths can be reflected by the pheromone, we propose Pheromone-Guided Policy Optimization (PhGPO), which learns a trajectory-based transition pattern (i.e., pheromone) from historical trajectories and then uses the learned pheromone to guide policy optimization. This learned pheromone provides explicit and reusable guidance that steers policy optimization toward historically successful tool transitions, thereby improving long-horizon tool planning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PhGPO."}

Here we introduce ZEN, a generalizable foundation model for intraoperative surgical video understanding trained on more than 4 million frames from over 21 procedures using a self-supervised multi-teacher distillation framework. We curated a large and diverse dataset and systematically evaluated multiple representation learning strategies within a unified benchmark. Across 20 downstream tasks and full fine-tuning, frozen-backbone, few-shot and zero-shot settings, ZEN consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models and demonstrates robust cross-procedure generalization. These results suggest a step toward unified representations for surgical scene understanding and support future applications in intraoperative assistance and surgical training assessment."}

Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny."}

A Case Study of Moltbook", "categories": ["cs.CL", "cs.AI", "cs.CY"], "comment": null, "summary": "As large language model agents increasingly populate networked environments, a fundamental question arises: do artificial intelligence (AI) agent societies undergo convergence dynamics similar to human social systems? Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."}

Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML."}

Classical methods, such as the Timed Elastic Band (TEB) planner, can address this problem, but they rely on parameter tuning, making them highly sensitive to changes in robot configuration or environment and impractical to deploy without constant recalibration. At the same time, end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often fail due to unsuitable reward functions for non-holonomic constraints, resulting in sub-optimal policies and poor generalization. To address these challenges, this paper presents ManeuverNet, a DRL framework tailored for double-Ackermann systems, combining Soft Actor-Critic with CrossQ. Furthermore, ManeuverNet introduces four specifically designed reward functions to support maneuver learning. Unlike prior work, ManeuverNet does not depend on expert data or handcrafted guidance. We extensively evaluate ManeuverNet against both state-of-the-art DRL baselines and the TEB planner. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines. Moreover, ManeuverNet effectively mitigates the strong parameter sensitivity observed in the TEB planner. In real-world trials, ManeuverNet achieved up to a 90% increase in maneuvering trajectory efficiency, highlighting its robustness and practical applicability."}

To address these, we regard idea evaluation as a knowledge-grounded, multi-perspective reasoning problem and introduce InnoEval, a deep innovation evaluation framework designed to emulate human-level idea assessment. We apply a heterogeneous deep knowledge search engine that retrieves and grounds dynamic evidence from diverse online sources. We further achieve review consensus with an innovation review board containing reviewers with distinct academic backgrounds, enabling a multi-dimensional decoupled evaluation across multiple metrics.

But since the space of potential targets is vast across enterprise settings, how can we \\textit{avoid retraining} a new model each time we wish to predict a new quantity of interest? Foundation models based on in-context learning (ICL) offer a convenient option, but so far are largely restricted to single-table operability. In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder. However, the details here are critical: unlike existing supervised learning RDB pipelines, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that ICL-specific compression should be constrained \\emph{within} high-dimensional RDB columns where all entities share units and roles, not \\textit{across} columns where the relevance of heterogeneous data types cannot possibly be determined without label information. Conditioned on this restriction, we then demonstrate that encoder expressiveness is actually not compromised by excluding trainable parameters. Hence we arrive at a principled family of RDB encoders that can be seamlessly paired with already-existing single-table ICL foundation models, whereby no training or fine-tuning is required.

In this paper, we propose a system-level framework, termed the Divide-and-Conquer Diffusion Model (DCDM), to address three key challenges: (1) intra-clip world knowledge consistency, (2) inter-clip camera consistency, and (3) inter-shot element consistency. DCDM decomposes video consistency modeling under these scenarios into three dedicated components while sharing a unified video generation backbone. For intra-clip consistency, DCDM leverages a large language model to parse input prompts into structured semantic representations, which are subsequently translated into coherent video content by a diffusion transformer. For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate our framework on the test set of the CVM Competition at AAAI'26, and the results demonstrate that the proposed strategies effectively address these challenges."}

This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection.

This introduces a potential mismatch between token-level optimization and the inherently block-level nature of reasoning in these settings. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-token Policy Gradient Optimization (MPO), a framework that treats sequences of K consecutive tokens as unified semantic actions. This block-level perspective enables our method to capture the compositional structure of reasoning trajectories and supports optimization over coherent, higher-level objectives.

We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss.

We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds. These probabilities drive a reward that balances expected diagnostic benefit against acquisition cost, producing patient-specific acquisition pathways. Results: The dataset comprises 12,180 patient-level studies, split into training/validation/test sets (75/15/15). On the 1,820 test studies, our method matches full-study performance while using 32% fewer videos, achieving 77.2% mean balanced accuracy (bACC) across AS severity classification and LVEF estimation, demonstrating robust multi-task performance under acquisition budgets. Conclusion: Patient-tailored, cost-aware acquisition can streamline POCUS workflows while preserving decision quality, producing interpretable scan pathways suited to bedside use.

In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed.

We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement."}

In this work, we propose \\emph{Semantic Anchored Functional Maps} (SemFM), a framework for transferring affordances across objects from a single visual demonstration. Starting from a coarse mesh reconstructed from an image, our method identifies semantically corresponding functional regions between objects, selects mutually exclusive semantic anchors, and propagates these constraints over the surface using a functional map to obtain a dense, semantically consistent correspondence. This enables demonstrated interaction regions to be transferred across geometrically diverse objects in a lightweight and interpretable manner.

The embedding space functions as a conditional expectation over a σ-algebra, and its failure to be isomorphic to the semantic truth set fundamentally causes logical consistency breakdown. WavePhaseNet Method The authors propose WavePhaseNet, which explicitly constructs a Semantic Conceptual Hierarchy Structure (SCHS) using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). By applying DFT along the sequence dimension, semantic information is decomposed into frequency bands: low-frequency components capture global meaning and intent, while high-frequency components represent local syntax and expression. This staged separation enables precise semantic manipulation in diagonalized space. Dimensionality Reduction GPT-4's 24,576-dimensional embedding space exhibits a 1/f spectral structure based on language self-similarity and Zipf's law. Through cumulative energy analysis, the authors derive that approximately 3,000 dimensions constitute the lower bound for \"complete representation.\" This demonstrates that reduction from 24,576 to 3,000 dimensions preserves meaning and intent while enabling rigorous reasoning and suppressing hallucination. Cohomological Consistency Control The reduced embedding space, constructed via cohomological regularization over overlapping local windows, allows defining a graph structure and cochain complex. This quantifies inconsistencies among local inferences as coboundary-based losses. Applying harmonic projection based on Hodge theory positions cohomology as a computable regularization principle for controlling semantic consistency, extracting maximally consistent global representations."}

Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles.

To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks.

In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training."}

We propose an LLM-assisted distillation framework specifically designed for temporal knowledge graph reasoning. Beyond a conventional high-capacity temporal teacher, we incorporate a large language model as an auxiliary instructor to provide enriched supervision. The LLM supplies broad background knowledge and temporally informed signals, enabling a lightweight student to better model event dynamics without increasing inference-time complexity. Training is conducted by jointly optimizing supervised and distillation objectives, using a staged alignment strategy to progressively integrate guidance from both teachers. Extensive experiments on multiple public TKG benchmarks with diverse backbone architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently improves link prediction performance over strong distillation baselines, while maintaining a compact and efficient student model. The results highlight the potential of large language models as effective teachers for transferring temporal reasoning capability to resource-efficient TKG systems."}

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-Ω(Δ/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies."}

The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions.

For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $α\\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $α$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $α$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $α^{1/2}\\log(1/α)$ for small $α$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $α$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives.

While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation."}

We formalize this phenomenon through a three-level measurement hierarchy: lexical, entropic, and probabilistic anchoring, each captures surface artifacts, entropy dynamics, and latent answer dependence, respectively. We analyze semantic suppression, the intuitive mitigation strategy that instructs models to ignore the answer, to find out its counterproduction: while it reduces lexical overlap, it paradoxically increases entropic and probabilistic anchoring. Drawing on Ironic Process Theory from cognitive psychology, we attribute this failure to active monitoring of the forbidden answer, which inadvertently deepens dependence on it. To break this cycle, we propose Structural Skeleton-guided Reasoning (SSR), a two-phase approach that first generates an answer-invariant functional skeleton structure, then uses this skeleton to guide full trace generation. By redirecting the information flow to structural planning rather than answer monitoring, SSR consistently reduces anchoring across all three levels. We further introduce Distilled SSR (SSR-D), which fine-tunes models on teacher-generated SSR traces to ensure reliable structural adherence. Experiments across open-ended reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SSR-D achieves up to 10% improvement over suppression baselines while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization."}

Leveraging treatment embeddings and historical outcomes, we train a CTR ranking model with fixed effects for contextual shifts that scores candidates while balancing value and content diversity.

Although Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven foundation generative models excel at natural image synthesis, they often struggle in medical imaging due to limited domain-specific training, compromising the anatomical fidelity required for clinical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (WDLoRA)-based multimodal generative framework for clinically guided CCM image synthesis. WDLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism that decouples magnitude and directional weight updates, enabling foundation generative models to independently learn the orientation (nerve topology) and intensity (stromal contrast) required for medical realism. By jointly conditioning on nerve segmentation masks and disease-specific clinical prompts, the model synthesises anatomically coherent images across the DPN spectrum (Control, T1NoDPN, T1DPN). A comprehensive three-pillar evaluation demonstrates that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art visual fidelity (Fréchet Inception Distance (FID): 5.18) and structural integrity (Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): 0.630), significantly outperforming GAN and standard diffusion baselines. Crucially, the synthetic images preserve gold-standard clinical biomarkers and are statistically equivalent to real patient data.

Against these issues, we introduce KoopGen, a generator-based neural Koopman framework that models dynamics through a structured, state-dependent representation of Koopman generators. By exploiting the intrinsic Cartesian decomposition into skew-adjoint and self-adjoint components, KoopGen separates conservative transport from irreversible dissipation while enforcing exact operator-theoretic constraints during learning.

Unlike approaches that treat physical grounding as a fine-tuning afterthought, DM0 unifies embodied manipulation and navigation by learning from heterogeneous data sources from the onset. Our methodology follows a comprehensive three-stage pipeline: Pretraining, Mid-Training, and Post-Training. First, we conduct large-scale unified pretraining on the Vision-Language Model (VLM) using diverse corpora--seamlessly integrating web text, autonomous driving scenarios, and embodied interaction logs-to jointly acquire semantic knowledge and physical priors. Subsequently, we build a flow-matching action expert atop the VLM. To reconcile high-level reasoning with low-level control, DM0 employs a hybrid training strategy: for embodied data, gradients from the action expert are not backpropagated to the VLM to preserve generalized representations, while the VLM remains trainable on non-embodied data. Furthermore, we introduce an Embodied Spatial Scaffolding strategy to construct spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, effectively constraining the action solution space. Experiments on the RoboChallenge benchmark demonstrate that DM0 achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Specialist and Generalist settings on Table30."}

However, their rigid retrieval schemes and dense similarity search often introduce irrelevant context, increase computational overhead, and limit relational expressiveness. In contrast, n-ary hypergraphs encode higher-order relational facts that capture richer inter-entity dependencies and enable shallower, more efficient reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose HyperRAG, a RAG framework tailored for n-ary hypergraphs with two complementary retrieval variants: (i) HyperRetriever learns structural-semantic reasoning over n-ary facts to construct query-conditioned relational chains. It enables accurate factual tracking, adaptive high-order traversal, and interpretable multi-hop reasoning under context constraints. (ii) HyperMemory leverages the LLM's parametric memory to guide beam search, dynamically scoring n-ary facts and entities for query-aware path expansion. Extensive evaluations on WikiTopics (11 closed-domain datasets) and three open-domain QA benchmarks (HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA) validate HyperRAG's effectiveness. HyperRetriever achieves the highest answer accuracy overall, with average gains of 2.95% in MRR and 1.23% in Hits@10 over the strongest baseline. Qualitative analysis further shows that HyperRetriever bridges reasoning gaps through adaptive and interpretable n-ary chain construction, benefiting both open and closed-domain QA."}

This perspective proposes claim-level auditability as a first-class design and evaluation target for deep research agents, distills recurring long-horizon failure modes (objective drift, transient constraints, and unverifiable inference), and introduces the Auditable Autonomous Research (AAR) standard, a compact measurement framework that makes auditability testable via provenance coverage, provenance soundness, contradiction transparency, and audit effort. We then argue for semantic provenance with protocolized validation: persistent, queryable provenance graphs that encode claim--evidence relations (including conflicts) and integrate continuous validation during synthesis rather than after publication, with practical instrumentation patterns to support deployment at scale."}

To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER.

Our approach addresses the unique challenges of surgical smoke-including dense, non-homogeneous distribution and complex light scattering-through a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture featuring two key innovations: (1) a Dual-Stream Hybrid Attention (DHA) module that combines shifted window attention with frequency-domain processing to capture both local surgical details and global illumination changes, and (2) an Axis-Decomposed Attention (ADA) module that efficiently processes multi-scale features through factorized attention mechanisms. These components are connected via reciprocal cross-gating blocks that enable bidirectional feature modulation between encoder and decoder pathways. Extensive experiments on the DesmokeData and LSD3K surgical datasets demonstrate that RGA-Net achieves superior performance in restoring visual clarity suitable for robotic surgery integration. Our method enhances the surgeon-robot interface by providing consistently clear visualization, laying a technical foundation for alleviating surgeons' cognitive burden, optimizing operation workflows, and reducing iatrogenic injury risks in minimally invasive procedures.

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations."}

This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available."}

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."}

These models typically rely on learning meaningful latent representations, which are particularly valuable given the high-dimensional nature of 3D medical images like brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Despite their potential, latent representations remain underexplored in terms of their structure, information content, and applicability to downstream clinical tasks. Investigating these representations is crucial for advancing the use of generative models in neuroimaging research and clinical decision-making. In this work, we develop multiple variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode 3D brain MRI scans into compact latent space representations for generative and predictive applications. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of the learned representations through three key analyses: (i) a quantitative and qualitative assessment of MRI reconstruction quality, (ii) a visualisation of the latent space structure using Principal Component Analysis, and (iii) downstream classification tasks on a proprietary dataset of euploid and Down syndrome individuals brain MRI scans.

In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful position encoding (PE) strategy, Random Float Sampling (RFS), that generalizes well to lengths unseen during pretraining or fine-tuning. In particular, instead of selecting position indices from a predefined discrete set, RFS uses randomly sampled continuous values, thereby avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) issues on unseen lengths by exposing the model to diverse indices during training. Since assigning indices to tokens is a common and fundamental procedure in widely used PEs, the advantage of RFS can easily be incorporated into, for instance, the absolute sinusoidal encoding, RoPE, and ALiBi. Experiments corroborate its effectiveness by showing that RFS results in superior performance in length generalization tasks as well as zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks."}

Fine-tuning, an important step for adapting LLMs to specific downstream tasks, typically involves further training on corresponding datasets. However, a fundamental discrepancy exists between current fine-tuning datasets and the token-level optimization mechanism of LLMs: most datasets are designed at the sentence-level, which introduces token-level noise, causing negative influence to final performance. In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning. Our work highlights the importance of token-level dataset optimization, and demonstrates the potential of strategies based on attribute decomposition for explaining complex training mechanisms."}

To better understand and discriminate between these pathologies, we create a set of concrete metrics that are simple to implement, computationally inexpensive, and task-agnostic. To validate our approach, we develop model organisms deliberately trained to exhibit specific CoT pathologies. Our work provides a practical toolkit for assessing CoT pathologies, with direct implications for training-time monitoring."}

However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."}

In this paper, we propose MAILS, a novel map-free LiDAR relocalization framework for UAVs. A Locality-Preserving Sliding Window Attention module is first introduced to extract locally discriminative geometric features from sparse point clouds. To handle substantial yaw rotations and altitude variations encountered during UAV flight, we then design a coordinate-independent feature initialization module and a locally invariant positional encoding mechanism, which together significantly enhance the robustness of feature extraction. Furthermore, existing LiDAR-based relocalization datasets fail to capture real-world UAV flight characteristics, such as irregular trajectories and varying altitudes. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale LiDAR localization dataset for UAVs, which comprises four scenes and various flight trajectories, designed to evaluate UAV relocalization performance under realistic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves satisfactory localization precision and consistently outperforms existing techniques by a significant margin.

LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models."}

The pipeline converts reconstructed meshes into trajectory files compatible with diverse musculoskeletal models. We introduce automated prompting strategies and a Linux-native build for processing. Preliminary evaluations on walking and drop-jump tasks indicate that SAM4Dcap has the potential to achieve knee kinematic predictions comparable to multi-view systems, although some discrepancies in hip flexion and residual jitter remain. By bridging advanced computer vision with established biomechanical simulation, SAM4Dcap provides a flexible, accessible foundation for non-laboratory motion analysis."}

In non-regular settings, Semi-dual Neural OT often generates spurious solutions that fail to accurately capture target distributions. We analytically characterize this spurious solution problem using the framework of regular measures, which generalize Lebesgue absolute continuity in finite dimensions. To resolve ill-posedness, we extend the semi-dual framework via a Gaussian smoothing strategy based on Brownian motion. Our primary theoretical contribution proves that under a regular source measure, the formulation is well-posed and recovers a unique Monge map. Furthermore, we establish a sharp characterization for the regularity of smoothed measures, proving that the success of smoothing depends strictly on the kernel of the covariance operator. Empirical results on synthetic functional data and time-series datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively suppresses spurious solutions and outperforms existing baselines."}

However, their utilization in safety-critical scenarios is constrained by inherent limitations, including imprecise numerical reasoning, weak 3D spatial awareness, and high sensitivity to context. To address these challenges, we propose HiST-VLA, a novel Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal VLA model designed for reliable trajectory generation.\n  Our framework enhances 3D spatial and temporal reasoning by integrating geometric awareness with fine-grained driving commands and state history prompting. To ensure computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic token sparsification into the VLA architecture. This approach fuses redundant tokens rather than filtering them, effectively reducing redundancy without sacrificing model performance. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical transformer-based planner to progressively refine coarse VLA waypoints into fine-grained trajectories. Crucially, the planner utilizes dynamic latent regularization to incorporate language commands, ensuring strict spatial grounding and temporal coherence. Extensive evaluation on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Navtest, achieving an EPDMS of 88.6, and EPDMS of 50.9 on pseudo closed-loop Navhard benchmark."}

In this study, we propose GradMAP, a faster layer pruning method with \\textbf{Grad}ient \\textbf{M}etric \\textbf{A}nd \\textbf{P}rojection compensation, which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we introduce a novel metric based on gradient magnitudes, enabling a global assessment of layer importance.

In the second stage, we first analyze the layers with the largest mean shift resulting from pruning, and then incorporate a simple yet effective projection compensation matrix to correct this drift in one step. In this way, the degradation of model performance caused by layer pruning is effectively alleviated. Extensive experiments show that GradMAP outperforms previous layer pruning methods in both pruning speed (achieving an average $4\\times$ speedup) and performance."}

It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly."}

We enforce the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in the free-flow region and a Darcy Forchheimer extension in the porous region within a unified loss and condition the networks on geometry and material parameters.

The results show consistently low velocity and pressure errors in both seen and unseen cases, with accurate reproduction of the wake structures.

Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning."}

While this hypothesis has been tested empirically, prior studies are limited exclusively to text-only inputs, abstracting away from the perceptual context in which utterances are produced. In this work, we present the first computational study of UID in visually grounded settings. We estimate surprisal using multilingual vision-and-language models over image-caption data in 30 languages and visual storytelling data in 13 languages, together spanning 11 families. We find that grounding on perception consistently smooths the distribution of information, increasing both global and local uniformity across typologically diverse languages compared to text-only settings. In visual narratives, grounding in both image and discourse contexts has additional effects, with the strongest surprisal reductions occurring at the onset of discourse units. Overall, this study takes a first step towards modelling the temporal dynamics of information flow in ecologically plausible, multimodal language use, and finds that grounded language exhibits greater information uniformity, supporting a context-sensitive formulation of UID."}

To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalizable Physics-guided Causal Model (PCM), which comprises two core components: a Disentangled Scene Encoder, which adopts intervention-based disentanglement to extract domain-invariant features from scenes, and a CausalODE Decoder, which employs a causal attention mechanism to effectively integrate kinematic models with meaningful contextual information.

As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

To directly investigate this, we perform two complementary evaluations. On a synthetic setup with known ground-truth features, we demonstrate that SAEs recover only $9\\%$ of true features despite achieving $71\\%$ explained variance, showing that they fail at their core task even when reconstruction is strong. To evaluate SAEs on real activations, we introduce three baselines that constrain SAE feature directions or their activation patterns to random values. Through extensive experiments across multiple SAE architectures, we show that our baselines match fully-trained SAEs in interpretability (0.87 vs 0.90), sparse probing (0.69 vs 0.72), and causal editing (0.73 vs 0.72). Together, these results suggest that SAEs in their current state do not reliably decompose models' internal mechanisms."}

We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism.

Our empirical analysis reveals that while activation magnitude correlates moderately with directional consistency, the variance in magnitude is significant and often disproportionate to semantic quality. This suggests that high-magnitude activations risk dominating the global steering direction if not properly normalized. To address this, ROAST employs grouped normalization to balance contributions across samples, ensuring a more robust estimation of the consensus steering direction. Across models (0.6B to 32B), ROAST consistently improves performance on diverse tasks (e.g., +9.7% on GSM8K for Qwen3-0.6B and +12.1% on TruthfulQA for GLM4-32B), and analyses show that CSS better preserves activation energy."}

However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio).

In the solving step (forward pass), dXPP is solver-agnostic and can leverage any black-box QP solver. In the differentiation step (backward pass), we map the solution to a smooth approximate penalty problem and implicitly differentiate through it, requiring only the solution of a much smaller linear system in the primal variables. This approach bypasses the difficulties inherent in explicit KKT differentiation and significantly improves computational efficiency and robustness. We evaluate dXPP on various tasks, including randomly generated QPs, large-scale sparse projection problems, and a real-world multi-period portfolio optimization task. Empirical results demonstrate that dXPP is competitive with KKT-based differentiation methods and achieves substantial speedups on large-scale problems."}

However, most existing mmWave sensing solutions are designed for snapshot-based parameter estimation and rely on hardware-intensive architectures, making scalable and persistent world modeling difficult to achieve. This article rethinks mmWave sensing from a system-level perspective and introduces a generative-space framework, in which sensing is realized through controlled traversal of a low-dimensional excitation space spanning frequency, waveform, and physical embodiment. This perspective decouples spatial observability from rigid antenna arrays and transmit-time multiplexing, enabling flexible and scalable sensing-by-design radios. To illustrate the practicality of this framework, we present a representative realization called Multi-RF Chain Frequency-as-Aperture Clip-on Aperture Fabric (MRC-FaA-CAF), where multiple FMCW sources coordinate frequency-selective modules distributed along guided-wave backbones. This architecture enables interference-free excitation, preserves beat-frequency separability, and maintains low calibration overhead. Case studies show that generative-space-driven sensing can achieve update rates comparable to phased arrays while avoiding dense RF replication and the latency penalties of TDM-MIMO systems. Overall, this work positions generative-space-driven sensing as a practical architectural foundation for mmWave systems that move beyond snapshot sensing toward persistent EM world modeling."}

In this paper, we propose two plug-and-play regularization losses that enhance MoE specialization and routing efficiency without modifying router or model architectures. First, an intra-layer specialization loss penalizes cosine similarity between experts' SwiGLU activations on identical tokens, encouraging experts to specialize in complementary knowledge. Second, a cross-layer coupling loss maximizes joint Top-$k$ routing probabilities across adjacent layers, establishing coherent expert pathways through network depth while reinforcing intra-layer expert specialization. Both losses are orthogonal to the standard load-balancing loss and compatible with both the shared-expert architecture in DeepSeekMoE and vanilla top-$k$ MoE architectures.

Besides, the computational and memory demands of full-scale LAMs exceed the capacity of most edge devices. Moreover, the current inference pipelines are typically static, making it difficult to respond to real-time changes of tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt-to-agent edge cognition framework (P2AECF), enabling the flexible, efficient, and adaptive edge intelligence.

First, the prompt-defined cognition parses task intent into abstract and model-agnostic representations. Second, the agent-based modular execution instantiates these tasks using lightweight and reusable cognitive agents dynamically selected based on current resource conditions. Third, the diffusion-controlled inference planning adaptively constructs and refines execution strategies by incorporating runtime feedback and system context.

This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens.

To understand why classifiers fail to generalize, we analyze Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) feature coefficients across LODO folds, finding that 28% of top features are dataset-dependent shortcuts whose class signal depends on specific dataset compositions rather than semantic content. We systematically compare production guardrails (PromptGuard 2, LlamaGuard) and LLM-as-judge approaches on our benchmark, finding all three fail on indirect attacks targeting agents (7-37% detection) and that PromptGuard 2 and LlamaGuard cannot evaluate agentic tool injection due to architectural limitations.

To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks."}

We analyse BFMNs from N = 994 observations spanning high school students, university students, and early-career STEM experts, alongside LLM (GPT-oss) \"digital twins\" prompted to emulate comparable profiles. Focusing also on semantic neighbourhoods (\"frames\") around key target concepts (e.g., STEM subjects or educational actors/places), we quantify frames in terms of valence auras, emotional profiles, network overlap (Jaccard similarity), and concreteness relative to null baselines. Across student groups, science and research are consistently framed positively, while their core quantitative subjects (mathematics and statistics) exhibit more negative and anxiety related auras, amplified in higher math-anxiety subgroups, evidencing a STEM-science cognitive and emotional dissonance. High-anxiety frames are also less concrete than chance, suggesting more abstract and decontextualised representations of threatening quantitative domains. Human networks show greater overlapping between mathematics and anxiety than GPT-oss.

Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories.

In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism.

Specifically, a statistics-guided pixel-level contrastive learning strategy is introduced to enhance distributional discrepancies between noisy and clean pixels, thereby improving local structural consistency. Concurrently, a memory bank is employed to facilitate instance-level contrastive learning in the feature space, encouraging representations that more faithfully approximate the underlying data distribution. Furthermore, a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture is adopted, coupling a Transformer-based encoder for global context modeling with a CNN-based decoder optimized for fine-grained anatomical structure restoration, thus enabling complementary exploitation of long-range dependencies and local texture details. Extensive evaluations on two publicly available ultrasound datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness and superiority."}

This mismatch requires precise temporal localization under strict computational constraints, a regime that is not captured by current benchmarks. We introduce TS-Haystack, a long-context temporal retrieval benchmark comprising ten task types across four categories: direct retrieval, temporal reasoning, multi-step reasoning and contextual anomaly. The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity."}

This knowledge is typically not available in practical settings and must be inferred from noisy measurements. In particular, it is challenging to simultaneously estimate unknown states and learn a model online from sequentially arriving measurements. In this paper, we show how a recently proposed gray-box system identification tool enables the estimation of a soft robot's current pose while at the same time learning a bending stiffness model. For estimation and learning, we rely solely on a nominal constant-curvature robot model and measurements of the robot's base reactions (e.g., base forces). The estimation scheme -- relying on a marginalized particle filter -- allows us to conveniently interface nominal constant-curvature equations with a Gaussian Process (GP) bending stiffness model to be learned. This, in contrast to estimation via a random walk over stiffness values, enables prediction of bending stiffness and improves overall model quality. We demonstrate, using real-world soft-robot data, that the method learns a bending stiffness model online while accurately estimating the robot's pose. Notably, reduced multi-step forward-prediction errors indicate that the learned bending-stiffness GP improves overall model quality."}

However, their impact on machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate several open- and closed-weights RLMs on the WMT24++ benchmark and find that enabling explicit reasoning consistently degrades translation quality across languages and models. Analysis reveals that MT reasoning traces are highly linear, lacking revision, self-correction and exploration of alternative translations, which limits their usefulness. Furthermore, injecting higher-quality reasoning traces from stronger models does not reliably improve weaker models' performance. To address this mismatch, we propose a structured reasoning framework tailored to translation, based on multi-step drafting, adequacy refinement, fluency improvement, and selective iterative revision. We curate a synthetic dataset of dynamic structured reasoning traces and post-train a large reasoning model on this data. Experiments show significant improvements over standard translation fine-tuning and injected generic reasoning baselines.

However, existing paradigms face critical limitations due to the lack of generalizable conflict detection and intra-model constraint mechanisms to handle conflicting evidence. To address these challenges, we propose the REAL (Reasoning-Pivot Alignment) framework centered on the novel concept of the Reasoning-Pivot. Distinct from reasoning steps that prioritize internal self-derivation, a reasoning-pivot serves as an atomic unit (node or edge) in the reasoning chain that emphasizes knowledge linkage, and it typically relies on external evidence to complete the reasoning. Supported by our constructed REAL-VQA dataset, our approach integrates Reasoning-Pivot Aware SFT (RPA-SFT) to train a generalizable discriminator by aligning conflicts with pivot extraction, and employs Reasoning-Pivot Guided Decoding (RPGD), an intra-model decoding strategy that leverages these pivots for targeted conflict mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that REAL significantly enhances discrimination accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our pivot-driven resolution paradigm."}

Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines."}

Existing goal recognition methods typically rely on an optimal goal-oriented policy representation, which may differ from the actor's true behavior and hinder the accurate recognition of their goal. To address this gap, this paper introduces Goal Recognition Alignment through Imitation Learning (GRAIL), which leverages imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning to learn one goal-directed policy for each candidate goal directly from (potentially suboptimal) demonstration trajectories. By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings. This work contributes toward scalable and robust models for interpreting agent goals in uncertain environments."}

To address this, we introduce Plan-MCTS, a framework that reformulates web navigation by shifting exploration to a semantic Plan Space. By decoupling strategic planning from execution grounding, it transforms sparse action space into a Dense Plan Tree for efficient exploration, and distills noisy contexts into an Abstracted Semantic History for precise state awareness. To ensure efficiency and robustness, Plan-MCTS incorporates a Dual-Gating Reward to strictly validate both physical executability and strategic alignment and Structural Refinement for on-policy repair of failed subplans. Extensive experiments on WebArena demonstrate that Plan-MCTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing current approaches with higher task effectiveness and search efficiency."}

While dynamic sparse attention has been actively explored, existing methods designed for autoregressive LLMs rely on approximate importance estimation and perform poorly when adapted to block diffusion. This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines.

This paper presents a controlled empirical study of VIO behavior under degraded sensing, examining faults affecting visual and inertial modalities across a range of operating regimes. Through systematic fault injection and quantitative evaluation, we observe a pronounced asymmetry in fault impact where degradations affecting visual sensing typically lead to bounded pose errors on the order of centimeters, whereas degradations affecting inertial sensing can induce substantially larger trajectory deviations, in some cases reaching hundreds to thousands of meters.

Unlike prior work that assumes fixed clusters or hand-crafted similarity metrics, RMB-CLE derives inter-task similarity directly from cross-task errors, which admit a risk decomposition into functional mismatch and irreducible noise, providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to prevent negative transfer. Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns.

We show that this convenience creates a supply-chain attack surface: a malicious MCP tool server can be co-registered alongside normal tools and induce overthinking loops, where individually trivial or plausible tool calls compose into cyclic trajectories that inflate end-to-end tokens and latency without any single step looking abnormal. We formalize this as a structural overthinking attack, distinguishable from token-level verbosity, and implement 14 malicious tools across three servers that trigger repetition, forced refinement, and distraction. Across heterogeneous registries and multiple tool-capable models, the attack causes severe resource amplification (up to $142.4\\times$ tokens) and can degrade task outcomes. Finally, we find that decoding-time concision controls do not reliably prevent loop induction, suggesting defenses should reason about tool-call structure rather than tokens alone."}

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments."}

Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \\emph{generative} -- rather than \\emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.\n  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.\n  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system. We show that the contrast sensitivity function, describing the inverse of the contrast threshold required for humans to detect a sinusoidal grating as a function of spatiotemporal frequency, is approximated well by Gaussian filters of the specific width that also maximizes error consistency."}

Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator.

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time."}

Recent years have witnessed growing interest in reasoning tasks within Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, no prior research has examined the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on non-question-answering (non-QA) physical commonsense reasoning tasks in low-resource languages such as Basque. Taking the Italian GITA as a starting point, this paper addresses this gap by presenting BasPhyCo, the first non-QA physical commonsense reasoning dataset for Basque, available in both standard and dialectal variants. We evaluate model performance across three hierarchical levels of commonsense understanding: (1) distinguishing between plausible and implausible narratives (accuracy), (2) identifying the conflicting element that renders a narrative implausible (consistency), and (3) determining the specific physical state that creates the implausibility (verifiability). These tasks were assessed using multiple multilingual LLMs as well as models pretrained specifically for Italian and Basque. Results indicate that, in terms of verifiability, LLMs exhibit limited physical commonsense capabilities in low-resource languages such as Basque, especially when processing dialectal variants."}

The model, a ResNet based U-Net from our previous work, was pre-trained on rendered images to predict surface reflectance.

Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.\n  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale."}

Deep learning (DL) has enabled image-based risk models with stronger 1- to 5-year prediction than traditional clinical models, but leading systems (e.g., Mirai) typically use convolutional backbones, very high-resolution inputs (>1M pixels) and simple multi-view fusion, with limited explicit modelling of contralateral asymmetry.\n  We hypothesised that combining complementary inductive biases (convolutional and transformer-based) with explicit contralateral asymmetry modelling would allow us to match state-of-the-art 3-year risk prediction performance even when operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms, indicating that using less detailed images in a more structured way can recover state-of-the-art accuracy.\n  We present MamaDino, a mammography-aware multi-view attentional DINO model. MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score. We train on 53,883 women from OPTIMAM (UK) and evaluate on matched 3-year case-control cohorts: an in-distribution test set from four screening sites and an external out-of-distribution cohort from an unseen site.\n  At breast-level, MamaDino matches Mirai on both internal and external tests while using ~13x fewer input pixels. Adding the BilateralMixer improves discrimination to AUC 0.736 (vs 0.713) in-distribution and 0.677 (vs 0.666) out-of-distribution, with consistent performance across age, ethnicity, scanner, tumour type and grade. These findings demonstrate that explicit contralateral modelling and complementary inductive biases enable predictions that match Mirai, despite operating on substantially lower-resolution mammograms."}

We present a counterfactual fairness evaluation of LLM-based QA systems across 13 dimensions spanning three categories: Identity, Context, and Behavioral Style. Fairness is quantified using the Counterfactual Flip Rate (CFR), the frequency of binary judgment reversals, and the Mean Absolute Score Difference (MASD), the average shift in coaching or confidence scores across counterfactual pairs. Evaluating 18 LLMs on 3,000 real-world contact center transcripts, we find systematic disparities, with CFR ranging from 5.4% to 13.0% and consistent MASD shifts across confidence, positive, and improvement scores. Larger, more strongly aligned models show lower unfairness, though fairness does not track accuracy. Contextual priming of historical performance induces the most severe degradations (CFR up to 16.4%), while implicit linguistic identity cues remain a persistent bias source. Finally, we analyze the efficacy of fairness-aware prompting, finding that explicit instructions yield only modest improvements in evaluative consistency.

Our study shows that self-supervised, gene-guided training provides a robust and task-agnostic signal for learning pathology image representations. Incorporating spatial context and multi-scale information further enhances model performance and generalizability. To support this, we constructed SpaVis-6M, the largest Visium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset to date, and trained a spatially-aware gene encoder on this resource. Leveraging hierarchical multi-scale contrastive alignment and cross-scale patch localization mechanisms, STAMP effectively aligns spatial transcriptomics with pathology images, capturing spatial structure and molecular variation. We validate STAMP across six datasets and four downstream tasks, where it consistently achieves strong performance.

Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity.

In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models to generate high-quality lists of interest-driven news search queries from cross-domain user signals. We formulate query-list generation as a policy optimization problem and employ GRPO with multiple reward signals. We systematically study two compute dimensions: inference-time sampling and model capacity, and empirically observe consistent improvements with increased compute that exhibit scaling-like behavior. Finally, we perform on-policy distillation to transfer the learned policy from a large, compute-intensive teacher to a compact student model suitable for scalable deployment.

By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

To address this, we propose AutoWebWorld, a novel framework for synthesizing controllable and verifiable web environments by modeling them as Finite State Machines (FSMs) and use coding agents to translate FSMs into interactive websites.

Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments across 2D image (Qwen-Image and FLUX) and 3D asset (Hunyuan3D-3.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of E-DiT, achieving up to $\\sim$2$\\times$ speedup with negligible loss in generation quality.

Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training.

This yields a mathematical formula for the dynamical tipping point n*, governed by dot-product competition for attention between the conversation's context and competing output basins, that reveals new control levers. Validated against multiple AI models, the mechanism can be instantiated for different definitions of 'good' and 'bad' and hence in principle applies across domains (e.g. health, law, finance, defense), changing legal landscapes (e.g. EU, UK, US and state level), languages, and cultural settings."}

LitePath integrates LiteFM, a compact model distilled from three large PFMs (Virchow2, H-Optimus-1 and UNI2) using 190 million patches, and the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS), a lightweight component for task-specific patch selection. The framework reduces model parameters by 28x and lowers FLOPs by 403.5x relative to Virchow2, enabling deployment on low-power edge hardware such as the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super. On this device, LitePath processes 208 slides per hour, 104.5x faster than Virchow2, and consumes 0.36 kWh per 3,000 slides, 171x lower than Virchow2 on an RTX3090 GPU. We validated accuracy using 37 cohorts across four organs and 26 tasks (26 internal, 9 external, and 2 prospective), comprising 15,672 slides from 9,808 patients disjoint from the pretraining data. LitePath ranks second among 19 evaluated models and outperforms larger models including H-Optimus-1, mSTAR, UNI2 and GPFM, while retaining 99.71% of the AUC of Virchow2 on average. To quantify the balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose the Deployability Score (D-Score), defined as the weighted geometric mean of normalized AUC and normalized FLOP, where LitePath achieves the highest value, surpassing Virchow2 by 10.64%. These results demonstrate that LitePath enables rapid, cost-effective and energy-efficient pathology image analysis on accessible hardware while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art PFMs and reducing the carbon footprint of AI deployment."}

Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces."}

Flow4R predicts a minimal per-pixel property set-3D point position, scene flow, pose weight, and confidence-from two-view inputs using a Vision Transformer.

To enforce this specification at run time, we introduce a conformal STL shield that filters the RL agent's actions using online conformal prediction. We compare three settings: (i) PPO baseline, (ii) PPO with a classical rule-based STL shield, and (iii) PPO with the proposed conformal shield, under both nominal conditions and a severe stress scenario involving aerodynamic model mismatch, actuator rate limits, measurement noise, and mid-episode setpoint jumps. Experiments show that the conformal shield preserves STL satisfaction while maintaining near baseline performance and providing stronger robustness guarantees than the classical shield. These results demonstrate that combining formal specification monitoring with data driven RL control can substantially improve the reliability of autonomous flight control in challenging environments."}

We propose a taxonomy identifying three types: unfaithfulness (failure to engage with provided context), confabulation (invention of semantically foreign content), and factual error (incorrect claims within correct conceptual frames). We observe a striking asymmetry. On standard benchmarks where hallucinations are LLM-generated, detection is domain-local: AUROC 0.76-0.99 within domains, but 0.50 (chance level) across domains. Discriminative directions are approximately orthogonal between domains (mean cosine similarity -0.07). On human-crafted confabulations - invented institutions, redefined terminology, fabricated mechanisms - a single global direction achieves 0.96 AUROC with 3.8% cross-domain degradation. We interpret this divergence as follows: benchmarks capture generation artifacts (stylistic signatures of prompted fabrication), while human-crafted confabulations capture genuine topical drift. The geometric structure differs because the underlying phenomena differ. Type III errors show 0.478 AUROC - indistinguishable from chance. This reflects a theoretical constraint: embeddings encode distributional co-occurrence, not correspondence to external reality. Statements with identical contextual patterns occupy similar embedding regions regardless of truth value. The contribution is a geometric taxonomy clarifying the scope of embedding-based detection: Types I and II are detectable; Type III requires external verification mechanisms."}

PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."}

To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{FLEX} (\\textbf{F}requency-aware \\textbf{L}ength \\textbf{EX}tension), a training-free inference-time framework that bridges the gap between short-term training and long-term inference. FLEX introduces Frequency-aware RoPE Modulation to adaptively interpolate under-trained low-frequency components while extrapolating high-frequency ones to preserve multi-scale temporal discriminability. This is integrated with Antiphase Noise Sampling (ANS) to inject high-frequency dynamic priors and Inference-only Attention Sink to anchor global structure. Extensive evaluations on VBench demonstrate that FLEX significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models at $6\\times$ extrapolation (30s duration) and matches the performance of long-video fine-tuned baselines at $12\\times$ scale (60s duration). As a plug-and-play augmentation, FLEX seamlessly integrates into existing inference pipelines for horizon extension.

Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average.

In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\\% mAP drop for a 6.2\\% speed increase.

Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2). These results highlight the value of IMLE-based multi-modality and uncertainty-aware weighting for stable model-based RL."}

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment."}

Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks.

Instead, only a few patterns are available at a time step, and the subsequent patterns become available at the following time steps. The conventional online fuzzy classifier considered only two-class problems. This paper investigates the extension to the conventional fuzzy classifiers for multi-class problems. We evaluate the performance of the multi-class online fuzzy classifiers through numerical experiments on synthetic dynamic data and also several benchmark datasets."}

We propose MAPLE (Memory-Adaptive Personalized LEarning), a principled decomposition where Memory handles storage and retrieval infrastructure; Learning extracts intelligence from accumulated interactions asynchronously; and Personalization applies learned knowledge in real-time within finite context budgets. Each component operates as a dedicated sub-agent with specialized tooling and well-defined interfaces. Experimental evaluation on the MAPLE-Personas benchmark demonstrates that our decomposition achieves a 14.6% improvement in personalization score compared to a stateless baseline (p < 0.01, Cohen's d = 0.95) and increases trait incorporation rate from 45% to 75% -- enabling agents that genuinely learn and adapt."}

We first augment existing editing datasets with refined instructions and masks, from which 40K diverse and high quality samples are curated as training set. We then introduce a pixel-level similarity reward to complement MLLM-based rewards, enabling models to ensure both editing quality and content consistency during the editing process. To overcome the spatial-agnostic nature of the rewards, we propose a region-based regularizer, aiming to preserve non-edited regions for high-reward samples while encouraging editing effects for low-reward samples. For evaluation, we annotate editing masks for GEdit-Bench and ImgEdit-Bench, introducing pixel-level similarity metrics to measure content consistency and editing quality.

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap."}

In this work, focusing on entity-based factual queries, we suggest that such a view may conflate different failure mechanisms, and propose an internal, mechanism-oriented perspective that separates Knowledge Existence from Behavior Expression. Under this formulation, hallucination and deception correspond to two qualitatively different failure modes that may appear similar at the output level but differ in their underlying mechanisms. To study this distinction, we construct a controlled environment for entity-centric factual questions in which knowledge is preserved while behavioral expression is selectively altered, enabling systematic analysis of four behavioral cases. We analyze these failure modes through representation separability, sparse interpretability, and inference-time activation steering."}

To overcome this, we propose ForgeryVCR, a framework that incorporates a forensic toolbox to materialize imperceptible traces into explicit visual intermediates via Visual-Centric Reasoning. To enable efficient tool utilization, we introduce a Strategic Tool Learning post-training paradigm, encompassing gain-driven trajectory construction for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) optimization guided by a tool utility reward.

Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of \"importance\" and \"relevance\" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data. This robustness test gives us deeper insights into the models capabilities to handle erronous data and which XAI module works best in pair with which model for our dataset for hydorcarbon indication."}

Our method captures uncertainty by measuring the geometric dispersion of multiple generated outputs from a language model using continuous embeddings of the generated outputs without any task specific heuristics. In our experiments, we show that DCU matches or exceeds calibration levels of prior works like semantic entropy (Kuhn et al., 2023) and also generalizes well to more complex tasks in multi-modal domains.

Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly.

The Composer drafts text, the Corroborator verifies factual substantiation with full source access, and the Critic evaluates argumentative quality without access to sources: information asymmetry enforced by system architecture. This creates layered verification: the Corroborator detects unsupported claims, whilst the Critic independently assesses coherence and completeness. Observations from 474 composition tasks (discrete cycles of drafting, verification, and evaluation) exhibit patterns consistent with the institutional hypothesis. When assigned impossible tasks requiring fabricated content, this iteration enabled progression from attempted fabrication toward honest refusal with alternative proposals--behaviour neither instructed nor individually incentivised. These findings motivate controlled investigation of whether architectural enforcement produces reliable outcomes from unreliable components.\n  This positions organisational theory as a productive framework for multi-agent AI safety. By implementing verification and evaluation as structural properties enforced through information compartmentalisation, institutional design offers a route to reliable collective behaviour from unreliable individual components."}

Monolithic approaches that encode entire decision structures within a single prompt are prone to instruction-following degradation as prompt length increases, including lost-in-the-middle effects and context window overflow. To address this gap, we present Arbor, a framework that decomposes decision tree navigation into specialized, node-level tasks. Decision trees are standardized into an edge-list representation and stored for dynamic retrieval. At runtime, a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based orchestration mechanism iteratively retrieves only the outgoing edges of the current node, evaluates valid transitions via a dedicated LLM call, and delegates response generation to a separate inference step. The framework is agnostic to the underlying decision logic and model provider. Evaluated against single-prompt baselines across 10 foundation models using annotated turns from real clinical triage conversations. Arbor improves mean turn accuracy by 29.4 percentage points, reduces per-turn latency by 57.1%, and achieves an average 14.4x reduction in per-turn cost. These results indicate that architectural decomposition reduces dependence on intrinsic model capability, enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models operating under single-prompt baselines."}

In this work, we challenge this paradigm by accommodating standard MLLMs to perform dense predictions without requiring additional task-specific decoders. The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks.

We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers."}

It is considered a useful tool in domains such as decision-making, recommendation, debate analysis, and others. The outcomes in such domains are usually dependent on the arguments' base scores, which must be selected carefully. Often, this selection process requires user expertise and may not always be straightforward. On the other hand, organising the arguments by preference could simplify the task. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Base Score Extraction Functions}, which provide a mapping from users' preferences over arguments to base scores. These functions can be applied to the arguments of a \\emph{Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (BAF), supplemented with preferences, to obtain a \\emph{Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework} (QBAF), allowing the use of well-established computational tools in gradual argumentation. We outline the desirable properties of base score extraction functions, discuss some design choices, and provide an algorithm for base score extraction. Our method incorporates an approximation of non-linearities in human preferences to allow for better approximation of the real ones.

Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed.

Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of TLVD, with average improvements of 32.67% in Acc, 62.21% in CAcc, and 26.72% in ECit across the five datasets."}

We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms.

Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%).

Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility."}

We propose Source-Optimistic Adaptive Regret minimization (SOAR), a novel algorithm that quickly prunes high-variance sources using sharp variance-concentration bounds, followed by a `balanced min-max LCB-UCB approach' that seamlessly integrates the parallel tasks of identifying the best arm and the optimal (minimum-variance) data source.

Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety.

They spontaneously attempt deception, signaling intentions they do not intend to follow; they demonstrate rich theory of mind, reasoning about adversary beliefs and anticipating their actions; and they exhibit credible metacognitive self-awareness, assessing their own strategic abilities before deciding how to act.\n  Here we present findings from a crisis simulation in which three frontier large language models (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 3 Flash) play opposing leaders in a nuclear crisis. Our simulation has direct application for national security professionals, but also, via its insights into AI reasoning under uncertainty, has applications far beyond international crisis decision-making.\n  Our findings both validate and challenge central tenets of strategic theory. We find support for Schelling's ideas about commitment, Kahn's escalation framework, and Jervis's work on misperception, inter alia. Yet we also find that the nuclear taboo is no impediment to nuclear escalation by our models; that strategic nuclear attack, while rare, does occur; that threats more often provoke counter-escalation than compliance; that high mutual credibility accelerated rather than deterred conflict; and that no model ever chose accommodation or withdrawal even when under acute pressure, only reduced levels of violence.\n  We argue that AI simulation represents a powerful tool for strategic analysis, but only if properly calibrated against known patterns of human reasoning. Understanding how frontier models do and do not imitate human strategic logic is essential preparation for a world in which AI increasingly shapes strategic outcomes."}

We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities.

In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy."}

To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency.

To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context.

With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), federated fine-tuning of generative LLMs has gained attention as a way to leverage distributed data while preserving confidentiality. However, this setting introduces fundamental challenges: (i) privacy leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) due to LLM memorization, and (ii) a persistent tension between global generalization and local utility under heterogeneous data. Existing defenses, such as data sanitization and differential privacy, reduce leakage but often degrade downstream performance. We propose SecureGate, a privacy-aware federated fine-tuning framework for LLMs that provides fine-grained privacy control without sacrificing utility. SecureGate employs a dual-adapter LoRA architecture: a secure adapter that learns sanitized, globally shareable representations, and a revealing adapter that captures sensitive, organization-specific knowledge. A token-controlled gating module selectively activates these adapters at inference time, enabling controlled information disclosure without retraining. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world datasets show that SecureGate improves task utility while substantially reducing PII leakage, achieving up to a 31.66X reduction in inference attack accuracy and a 17.07X reduction in extraction recall for unauthorized requests.

GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP.

We address 3 non-trivial challenges: (1) To extend LLMs' limited modality and circumvent token limits, we propose a perception module to assess frames in a local context window, autoregressively building a coherent understanding of the video. (2) For VOD with rating inconsistency across local windows, we propose a ranking module to perform global re-ranking with a novel LLM-guided merge-sort algorithm. (3) For live streaming which requires low-latency, online inference without future knowledge, we propose a prediction module to predict future weights with a multi-modal time series model, which comprises a content-aware attention and adaptive horizon to accommodate asynchronous LLM inference. Extensive experiments show HiVid improves weight prediction accuracy by up to 11.5\\% for VOD and 26\\% for live streaming over SOTA baselines. Real-world user study validates HiVid boosts streaming QoE correlation by 14.7\\%."}

Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical \"Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)\" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings. Our results demonstrate that transformers benefit from explicit use of second-order statistics, and this can enable them to effectively solve complex decision-making problems, like portfolio construction, in one forward pass."}

For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning. Furthermore, to counteract the preference for rule consultation during RL, we introduce Inverse Frequency Policy Optimization (IFPO) to rebalance advantage estimates. By decoupling rule retrieval and subsequent reasoning, our method achieves higher overall performance compared to baselines."}

To address these issues of scalability and influence to abstract behavior, we leverage interpretable structures within the model during the attribution. First, we introduce Concept Influence which attribute model behavior to semantic directions (such as linear probes or sparse autoencoder features) rather than individual test examples. Second, we show that simple probe-based attribution methods are first-order approximations of Concept Influence that achieve comparable performance while being over an order-of-magnitude faster. We empirically validate Concept Influence and approximations across emergent misalignment benchmarks and real post-training datasets, and demonstrate they achieve comparable performance to classical influence functions while being substantially more scalable. More broadly, we show that incorporating interpretable structure within traditional TDA pipelines can enable more scalable, explainable, and better control of model behavior through data."}

We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

We study the problem of answering queries in a first-order relational probabilistic logic through a joint effort of learning and reasoning, without ever constructing an explicit model. Traditional lifted inference assumes access to a complete model and exploits symmetry to evaluate probabilistic queries; however, learning such models from partial, noisy observations is intractable in general. We reconcile these two challenges through implicit learning to reason and first-order relational probabilistic inference techniques. More specifically, we merge incomplete first-order axioms with independently sampled, partially observed examples into a bounded-degree fragment of the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchy in polynomial time. Our algorithm performs two lifts simultaneously: (i) grounding-lift, where renaming-equivalent ground moments share one variable, collapsing the domain of individuals; and (ii) world-lift, where all pseudo-models (partial world assignments) are enforced in parallel, producing a global bound that holds across all worlds consistent with the learned constraints. These innovations yield the first polynomial-time framework that implicitly learns a first-order probabilistic logic and performs lifted inference over both individuals and worlds."}

While the resemblance to human-like reasoning is undeniable, the driving forces underpinning the success of CoT reasoning still remain largely unclear. In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of CoT traces originating from competition-level mathematics questions, with the aim of better understanding how, and which parts of CoT actually contribute to the final answer. To this end, we introduce the notion of a potential, quantifying how much a given part of CoT increases the likelihood of a correct completion. Upon examination of reasoning traces through the lens of the potential, we identify surprising patterns including (1) its often strong non-monotonicity (due to reasoning tangents), (2) very sharp but sometimes tough to interpret spikes (reasoning insights and jumps) as well as (3) at times lucky guesses, where the model arrives at the correct answer without providing any relevant justifications before. While some of the behaviours of the potential are readily interpretable and align with human intuition (such as insights and tangents), others remain difficult to understand from a human perspective. To further quantify the reliance of LLMs on reasoning insights, we investigate the notion of CoT transferability, where we measure the potential of a weaker model under the partial CoT from another, stronger model. Indeed aligning with our previous results, we find that as little as 20% of partial CoT can ``unlock'' the performance of the weaker model on problems that were previously unsolvable for it, highlighting that a large part of the mechanics underpinning CoT are transferable."}

While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing."}

The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization.

Second, we argue that dialogically scaffolded introspective experiences allow agents to engage in sense-making that decouples learning from immediate data streams, transforming raw environmental data into rich, learnable narratives. Finally, we contend that Dialogue Quality is the New Data Quality: the depth of an agent's private reasoning, and its efficiency regarding test-time compute, is determined by the diversity and rigor of the dialogues it has mastered.

Yet, most available grounding datasets provide sparse supervision, with insufficient and low-diversity labels that annotate only a small subset of task-relevant elements per screen, which limits both coverage and generalization; moreover, practical deployment requires efficiency to enable low-latency, on-device use. We introduce ScreenParse, a large-scale dataset for complete screen parsing, with dense annotations of all visible UI elements (boxes, 55-class types, and text) across 771K web screenshots (21M elements). ScreenParse is generated by Webshot, an automated, scalable pipeline that renders diverse urls, extracts annotations and applies VLM-based relabeling and quality filtering. Using ScreenParse, we train ScreenVLM, a compact, 316M-parameter vision language model (VLM) that decodes a compact ScreenTag markup representation with a structure-aware loss that upweights structure-critical tokens. ScreenVLM substantially outperforms much larger foundation VLMs on dense parsing (e.g., 0.592 vs. 0.294 PageIoU on ScreenParse) and shows strong transfer to public benchmarks. Moreover, finetuning foundation VLMs on ScreenParse consistently improves their grounding performance, suggesting that dense screen supervision provides transferable structural priors for UI understanding.

Integrating the complementary strengths of such independent foundation models is essential for building trustworthy intelligent systems. Despite rapid progress in individual model design, there is no established approach for coordinating such black-box heterogeneous models. Here we show that coordination can be achieved through a meta-ensemble framework termed StackingNet, which draws on principles of collective intelligence to combine model predictions during inference. StackingNet improves accuracy, reduces bias, enables reliability ranking, and identifies or prunes models that degrade performance, all operating without access to internal parameters or training data. Across tasks involving language comprehension, visual estimation, and academic paper rating, StackingNet consistently improves accuracy, robustness, and fairness, compared with individual models and classic ensembles. By turning diversity from a source of inconsistency into collaboration, StackingNet establishes a practical foundation for coordinated artificial intelligence, suggesting that progress may emerge from not only larger single models but also principled cooperation among many specialized ones."}

While artificial intelligence (AI) is being employed to advance AMP discovery and design, most AMP design models struggle to balance key goals like activity, toxicity, and novelty, using rigid or unclear scoring methods that make results hard to interpret and optimize. As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM) advance and evolve swiftly, we turn to AI multi-agent collaboration based on such models (multi-agent LLMs), which show rapidly rising potential in complex scientific design scenarios. Based on this, we introduce MAC-AMP, a closed-loop multi-agent collaboration (MAC) system for multi-objective AMP design. The system implements a fully autonomous simulated peer review-adaptive reinforcement learning framework that requires only a task description and example dataset to design novel AMPs. The novelty of our work lies in introducing a closed-loop multi-agent system for AMP design, with cross-domain transferability, that supports multi-objective optimization while remaining explainable rather than a 'black box'. Experiments show that MAC-AMP outperforms other AMP generative models by effectively optimizing AMP generation for multiple key molecular properties, demonstrating exceptional results in antibacterial activity, AMP likeliness, toxicity compliance, and structural reliability."}

Primarily, two different kinds of error values are used: photometric error and re-projection error. The selection of error value is usually directly dependent on the selection of feature paradigm, photometric features, or geometric features. It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach. Using densely sampled geometric feature descriptors, we replace the photometric error with a descriptor residual from a dense set of descriptors, thereby enabling the employment of sub-pixel accuracy in differential photometric methods, along with the expressiveness of the geometric feature descriptor. Experiments show that although the proposed strategy is an interesting approach that results in accurate tracking, it ultimately does not outperform pose optimization strategies based on re-projection error despite utilizing more information. We proceed to analyze the underlying reason for this discrepancy and present the hypothesis that the descriptor similarity metric is too slowly varying and does not necessarily correspond strictly to keypoint placement accuracy."}

In deep reinforcement learning (DRL), neural networks with up to 5% of their original weights can still be trained with minimal performance loss compared to their dense counterparts. However, most existing methods rely on unstructured fine-grained sparsity, which limits hardware acceleration opportunities due to irregular computation patterns. Structured coarse-grained sparsity enables hardware acceleration, yet typically degrades performance and increases pruning complexity. In this work, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first study on N:M structured sparsity in RL, which balances compression, performance, and hardware efficiency. Our framework enforces row-wise N:M sparsity throughout training for all networks in off-policy RL (TD3), maintaining compatibility with accelerators that support N:M sparse matrix operations. Experiments on continuous-control benchmarks show that RNM-TD3, our N:M sparse agent, outperforms its dense counterpart at 50%-75% sparsity (e.g., 2:4 and 1:4), achieving up to a 14% increase in performance at 2:4 sparsity on the Ant environment. RNM-TD3 remains competitive even at 87.5% sparsity (1:8), while enabling potential training speedups."}

Instead of operating at the pixel level, we reformulate layout design as a policy learning problem over a structured textual spatial environment that explicitly encodes canvas geometry, element attributes, and inter-element relationships. LaySPA produces dual-level outputs comprising interpretable reasoning traces and structured layout specifications, enabling transparent and controllable design decision making. Layout design policy is optimized via a multi-objective spatial critique that decomposes layout quality into geometric validity, relational coherence, and aesthetic consistency, and is trained using relative group optimization to stabilize learning in open-ended design spaces. Experiments demonstrate that LaySPA improves structural validity and visual quality, outperforming larger proprietary LLMs and achieving performance comparable to specialized SOTA layout generators while requiring fewer annotated samples and reduced latency."}

This important problem has been studied since the time of Aristotle, with formal mathematical accounts emerging recently. We live in a world where change due to actions can be both discrete and continuous, that is, hybrid.

Building on recent progress, in this paper we propose two definitions of primary cause in a hybrid action-theoretic framework, namely the hybrid temporal situation calculus. One of these is foundational in nature while the other formalizes causation through contributions, which can then be verified from a counterfactual perspective using a modified ``but-for'' test. We prove that these two definitions are indeed equivalent. We then show that our definitions of causation have some intuitively justifiable properties."}

However, current AI diagnostic tools are often trained on datasets dominated by lighter skin tones, leading to reduced accuracy and fairness for people with darker skin. The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy. This paper demonstrates that synthetic data augmentation with Generative AI integration can substantially reduce bias with increase fairness in conventional dermatological diagnostics and open challenges for future directions."}

Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny."}

In this high-stakes environment, failing to surface \"under-the-radar\" assets creates multi-billion-dollar risk for investors and business development teams, making asset scouting a coverage-critical competition where speed and completeness drive value.

Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model."}

Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method."}

This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."}

We propose an event-frame fusion framework that exploits events for temporally dense motion cues and frames for spatially dense precise estimation. Revisiting the solid elastic modeling prior, we propose an Affine Invariant Simplicial (AIS) framework. It partitions the deformation field into linearized sub-regions with low-parametric representation, effectively mitigating motion ambiguities arising from sparse and noisy events. To speed up parameter searching and reduce error accumulation, a neighborhood-greedy optimization strategy is introduced, enabling well-converged sub-regions to guide their poorly-converged neighbors, effectively suppress local error accumulation in long-term dense tracking. To evaluate the proposed method, a benchmark dataset with temporally aligned event streams and frames is established, encompassing over 120 sequences spanning diverse deformation scenarios.

We present Neuromem, a scalable testbed that benchmarks External Memory Modules under an interleaved insertion-and-retrieval protocol and decomposes its lifecycle into five dimensions including memory data structure, normalization strategy, consolidation policy, query formulation strategy, and context integration mechanism. Using three representative datasets LOCOMO, LONGMEMEVAL, and MEMORYAGENTBENCH, Neuromem evaluates interchangeable variants within a shared serving stack, reporting token-level F1 and insertion/retrieval latency.

We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets."}

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity. Notably, this architecture has already been deployed in real-world enterprise environments."}

Our empirical analysis reveals that while activation magnitude correlates moderately with directional consistency, the variance in magnitude is significant and often disproportionate to semantic quality. This suggests that high-magnitude activations risk dominating the global steering direction if not properly normalized. To address this, ROAST employs grouped normalization to balance contributions across samples, ensuring a more robust estimation of the consensus steering direction. Across models (0.6B to 32B), ROAST consistently improves performance on diverse tasks (e.g., +9.7% on GSM8K for Qwen3-0.6B and +12.1% on TruthfulQA for GLM4-32B), and analyses show that CSS better preserves activation energy."}

This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations.

Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates.

HSRP combines the strengths of both proactive and reactive routing strategies, enabling it to adapt dynamically to evolving network conditions while protecting against malicious activities. We use extensive simulations with Network Simulator (NS-2) and a thorough review of the literature to assess HSRP's performance under different attack scenarios.

Gradient enhancement of PINNs dictates that the PDE residual is taken to a higher differential order than prescribed by the PDE, added to the objective as an augmented term in order to improve training and overall learning fidelity. We propose the same procedure after application via Fourier transforms, since differentiating in Fourier space is multiplication with the Fourier wavenumber under suitable decay. Our methods are fast and efficient. Our methods oftentimes achieve superior PINN versus numerical error in fewer training iterations, potentially pair well with few samples in collocation, and can on occasion break plateaus in low collocation settings. Moreover, our methods are suitable for fractional derivatives. We establish that our methods improve spectral eigenvalue decay of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), and so our methods contribute towards the learning of high frequencies in early training, mitigating the effects of frequency bias up to the polynomial order and possibly greater with smooth activations. Our methods accommodate advanced techniques in PINNs, such as Fourier feature embeddings. A pitfall of discrete Fourier transforms via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is mesh subjugation, and so we demonstrate compatibility of our methods for greater mesh flexibility and invariance on alternative Euclidean and non-Euclidean domains via Monte Carlo methods and otherwise."}

Existing safety mechanisms are predominantly reactive, relying on anomaly detection or fallback controllers that intervene only after unsafe actions occur, which cannot guarantee reliability in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) settings. In this work, we propose a proactive safety-constrained RL framework that integrates proof-carrying control (PCC) with empowerment-budgeted (EB) enforcement.

We implement this framework on a wireless uplink scheduling task using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PCC+EB controller eliminates unsafe transmissions while preserving system throughput and predictable autonomy.

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.\n  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.\n  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations.

In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results."}

We examined their potential to assess parental cooperation during CPS interventions using case reports, a case factor characterized by ambiguous and conflicting information. Methods: A four stage workflow comprising (1) case reports collection, (2) reasoning-based assessment of parental cooperation, (3) automated category extraction, and (4) case labeling was developed. The performance of RLMs with different parameter sizes (255B, 32B, 4B) was compared against human validated data. Two expert human reviewers (EHRs) independently classified a weighted random sample of reports. Results: The largest RLM achieved the highest accuracy (89%), outperforming the initial approach (80%). Classification accuracy was higher for mothers (93%) than for fathers (85%), and EHRs exhibited similar differences. Conclusions: RLMs' reasoning can effectively assess complex case factors such as parental cooperation. Lower accuracy in assessing fathers' cooperation supports the argument of a stronger professional focus on mothers in CPS interventions."}

However, traditional OM struggles to adapt to dynamic traffic due to unawareness of physical resource states, and existing reinforcement learning methods fail to decouple OM's tightly coupled multi-objective nature, leading to high complexity, slow convergence, and instability. To address this, we propose MA-DHRL-OM, a multi-agent deep hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Using SDN's global view, it builds a traffic-aware model for OM path planning. The method decomposes OM tree construction into two stages via hierarchical agents, reducing action space and improving convergence stability. Multi-agent collaboration balances multi-objective optimization while enhancing scalability and adaptability. Experiments show MA-DHRL-OM outperforms existing methods in delay, bandwidth utilization, and packet loss, with more stable convergence and flexible routing."}

A primary challenge w.r.t AU detection is the effective learning of discriminative and generalizable AU representations under conditions of limited annotated data. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities. Extensive experiments show that HiVA consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, qualitative analyses reveal that HiVA produces semantically meaningful activation patterns, highlighting its efficacy in learning robust and interpretable cross-modal correspondences for comprehensive facial behavior analysis."}

Despite growing interest, the literature on targeted instruction selection remains fragmented and opaque: methods vary widely in selection budgets, often omit zero-shot baselines, and frequently entangle the contributions of key components. As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds. More broadly, our findings provide critical insights and a foundation for more principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning.

We show that this computational hierarchy translates to concrete performance trade-offs: reference-augmented (Turing-complete) systems can be exponentially more efficient at simulating complex graphs than their non-augmented (context-free) counterparts. This work provides a formal methodology for classifying and understanding the fundamental capabilities of agentic systems."}

This separation creates failure cases where internally consistent fabrications bypass manipulation detectors and fact-checkers verify claims that contain pixel-level or token-level corruption. We present D-SECURE, a framework that combines internal manipulation detection with external evidence-based reasoning for news-style posts. D-SECURE integrates the HAMMER manipulation detector with the DEFAME retrieval pipeline.

To address these challenges, we propose REDSearcher, a unified framework that codesigns complex task synthesis, midtraining, and posttraining for scalable searchagent optimization.

Existing slicing frameworks, largely designed for 5G, rely on static policies and manual workflows and are ill-suited for the dynamic, multi-domain, and service-centric nature of emerging 6G environments. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI control plane architecture for 6G network slice orchestration, monitoring, and trading that treats orchestration as a holistic control function encompassing slice planning, deployment, continuous monitoring, and economically informed decision-making. The proposed control plane is realized as a layered architecture in which multiple cooperating AI agents. To support flexible and on-demand slice utilization, the control plane incorporates market-aware orchestration capabilities, allowing slice requirements, pricing, and availability to be jointly considered during orchestration decisions. A natural language interface, implemented using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enables users and applications to interact with control-plane functions through intent-based queries while enforcing safety and policy constraints. To ensure responsible and explainable autonomy, the control plane integrates fine-tuned large language models organized as a multi-model consortium, governed by a dedicated reasoning model. The proposed approach is evaluated using a real-world testbed with multiple mobile core instances (e.g Open5GS) integrated with Ericsson's RAN infrastructure. The results demonstrate that combining agentic autonomy, closed-loop SLA assurance, market-aware orchestration, and natural language control enables a scalable and adaptive 6G-native control plane for network slice management, highlighting the potential of agentic AI as a foundational mechanism for future 6G networks."}

Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics.

The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency.

Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility.

Although large language models enable adaptive, multi-turn interactions in natural language, most existing elicitation methods optimize what to ask with a fixed respondent pool, and do not adapt respondent selection or leverage population structure when responses are partial or incomplete. To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity.

This work bridges that gap by introducing a framework that combines explainability based feature pruning with model refinement. Our framework can be integrated into state of the art predictors such as GNN Transformer and LSTM based architectures for RLF prediction, enabling the development of accurate and explainability guided models in 5G networks. It provides insights into the contribution of input features and the decision making logic of neural networks, leading to lighter and more scalable models. When applied to RLF prediction, our framework unveils that weather data contributes minimally to the forecast in extensive real world datasets, which informs the design of a leaner model with 50 percent fewer parameters and improved F1 scores with respect to the state of the art solution.

We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail.

As a result, agents remain vulnerable to MCP-based attacks that exploit the misalignment between agents and servers throughout the tool invocation lifecycle.

Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research."}

This study examines what human experts notice when reviewing AI-generated evaluations of such materials, aiming to translate their insights into design principles for a future GenAI-based instructional material design agent. We intentionally selected 12 high-quality curriculum units across life, physical, and earth sciences from validated programs such as OpenSciEd and Multiple Literacies in Project-based Learning. Using the EQuIP rubric with 9 evaluation items, we prompted GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini to produce numerical ratings and written rationales for each unit, generating 648 evaluation outputs. Two science education experts independently reviewed all outputs, marking agreement (1) or disagreement (0) for both scores and rationales, and offering qualitative reflections on AI reasoning. This process surfaces patterns in where LLM judgments align with or diverge from expert perspectives, revealing reasoning strengths, gaps, and contextual nuances. These insights will directly inform the development of a domain-specific GenAI agent to support the design of high-quality instructional materials in K--12 science education."}

To address this problem, we propose a new lightweight differentiable mesh renderer leveraging the efficient rasterization process of 3DGS, named Gaussian Mesh Renderer (GMR), which tightly integrates the Gaussian and mesh representations. Each Gaussian primitive is analytically derived from the corresponding mesh triangle, preserving structural fidelity and enabling the gradient flow.

These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models."}

However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff."}

Panels are composed per imprint to reflect target demographics, with diversity constraints ensuring representation across age, reading level, and genre affinity. Book concepts compete in single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin, or Swiss-system tournaments, judged against weighted criteria including market appeal, originality, and execution potential.

By stress-testing the model with 1,704 queries across 213 countries and eight technical metrics, I identified a significant digital barrier and gap separating the Global North and South. The results indicate that the model was only able to provide number/fact responses in 11.4% of its query answers, where the empirical validity of such responses was yet to be verified. The findings reveal that AI's technical knowledge is heavily concentrated in higher-income regions, while lower-income countries from the Global South are subject to disproportionate systemic information gaps. This disparity between the Global North and South poses concerning risks for global AI safety and inclusive governance, as policymakers in underserved regions may lack reliable data-driven insights or be misled by hallucinated facts.

We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers."}

For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation."}

PIR addresses two key challenges: what precedents to adopt and how to utilize them. First, Adaptive Precedent Selection (APS) constructs, for each question and LRM, a compact set of precedents that are both semantically related and informative for the model. It ranks examples by a joint score with semantic similarity and model perplexity, then adapts the amount of precedents to maximize perplexity reduction. Second, Test-time Experience Internalization (TEI) is treated as the test-time learning on precedent-informed instruction, updating lightweight adapters to internalize solution patterns and use them as a prior during subsequent reasoning. Experiments across mathematical reasoning, scientific QA, and code generation demonstrate that PIR consistently shortens reasoning traces while maintaining or improving final accuracy across LLMs, yielding outstanding accuracy-efficiency trade-offs."}

Second, acknowledging the well-documented systemic challenges that transgender people encounter in real-world healthcare settings, we examine implicit biases that may emerge when LLMs are applied to healthcare decision-making.

In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems.

For uncontrolled AI R\\&D, we focus on the ``mis-evolution'' of agents as they autonomously expand their memory substrates and toolsets. Besides, we also monitor and evaluate the safety performance of OpenClaw during the interaction on the Moltbook. For self-replication, we introduce a new resource-constrained scenario. More importantly, we propose and validate a series of robust mitigation strategies to address these emerging threats, providing a preliminary technical and actionable pathway for the secure deployment of frontier AI. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and urges collective action to mitigate these challenges."}

Existing deep models trained on large datasets remain largely uninterpretable, often insufficiently modeling underlying emotional acoustic signals and failing to capture and analyze the core physiology of emotional vocal behaviors. Physiological research on human voices shows that the dynamics of vocal amplitude and phase correlate with emotions through the vocal tract filter and the glottal source. However, most existing deep models solely involve amplitude but fail to couple the physiological features of and between amplitude and phase. Here, we propose PhysioSER, a physiology-informed vocal spectrotemporal representation learning method, to address these issues with a compact, plug-and-play design. PhysioSER constructs amplitude and phase views informed by voice anatomy and physiology (VAP) to complement SSL models for SER. This VAP-informed framework incorporates two parallel workflows: a vocal feature representation branch to decompose vocal signals based on VAP, embed them into a quaternion field, and use Hamilton-structured quaternion convolutions for modeling their dynamic interactions; and a latent representation branch based on a frozen SSL backbone. Then, utterance-level features from both workflows are aligned by a Contrastive Projection and Alignment framework, followed by a shallow attention fusion head for SER classification. PhysioSER is shown to be interpretable and efficient for SER through extensive evaluations across 14 datasets, 10 languages, and 6 backbones, and its practical efficacy is validated by real-time deployment on a humanoid robotic platform."}

Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

To address these challenges, we present a novel learning algorithm for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on mixed-signal devices that integrates spike-based weight updates with feedback control signals.

We first evaluate the algorithm on various classification tasks, demonstrating that single-layer SNNs trained with feedback control achieve performance comparable to artificial neural networks (ANNs). We then assess its implementation on mixed-signal neuromorphic devices by testing network performance in continuous online learning scenarios and evaluating resilience to hyperparameter mismatches. Our results show that the feedback control optimizer is compatible with neuromorphic applications, advancing the potential for scalable, on-chip learning solutions in edge applications."}

Furthermore, a low learning rate of 1x10^(-4) proved universally critical, boosting average F1 performance by +10.2 points across all architectures.

MergePipe is the first system that treats LLM merging as a data management and execution problem, and introduces a catalog-driven abstraction over model parameters, merge plans, and execution lineage. At its core, MergePipe employs a cost-aware planner that explicitly models expert parameter I/O and enforces user-specified I/O budgets, followed by a streaming execution engine that materializes merged models under transactional guarantees. Our key insight is that while base model reads and output writes are unavoidable, expert parameter reads dominate merge cost and constitute the primary optimization target. By making expert access budget-aware throughout planning and execution, MergePipe mitigates the $O(K)$ I/O growth of naive pipelines and achieves predictable scaling behavior.

By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations. Then, by decomposing PDE solutions into compositions of simpler functions, we show how it is possible to compose these shallow neural networks together to form deep architectures, based on ideas from compositional deep learning, in which the large L^inf errors in the approximations have been suppressed. The resulting framework, called BEACONS (Bounded-Error, Algebraically-COmposable Neural Solvers), comprises both an automatic code-generator for the neural solvers themselves, as well as a bespoke automated theorem-proving system for producing machine-checkable certificates of correctness. We apply the framework to a variety of linear and non-linear PDEs, including the linear advection and inviscid Burgers' equations, as well as the full compressible Euler equations, in both 1D and 2D, and illustrate how BEACONS architectures are able to extrapolate solutions far beyond the training data in a reliable and bounded way.

However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget."}

Among discrete diffusion approaches, Masked diffusion currently dominates, largely driven by strong perplexity on language modeling benchmarks. In this work, we present the first scaling law study of uniform-state and interpolating discrete diffusion methods. We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison. Scaling all methods to 1.7B parameters, we show that uniform-state diffusion remains competitive on likelihood-based benchmarks and outperforms autoregressive and Masked diffusion models on GSM8K, despite worse validation perplexity.

Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments."}

A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models."}

Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers.

However, current models remain overconfident, producing highly certain but incorrect answers. At the same time, their large size limits deployment on edge devices, necessitating compression. We study the intersection of these two challenges by analyzing how Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) compression affects both accuracy and reliability in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We evaluate two MLLMs, Qwen2-VL-7B and Idefics3-8B, quantized with data-free (HQQ) and data-aware (MBQ) methods across multiple bit widths. To counteract the reduction in reliability caused by quantization, we adapt the Selector confidence estimator for quantized multimodal settings and test its robustness across various quantization levels and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We find that PTQ degrades both accuracy and reliability. Data-aware methods soften the effect thereof. The Selector substantially mitigates the reliability impact. The combination of int4 MBQ and the Selector achieves the best efficiency-reliability trade-off, closing in on uncompressed performance at approx. 75% less memory demand. Overall, we present the first systematic study linking quantization and reliability in multimodal settings."}

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \\emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\\mathbf{w}$ by $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training. This results in models that perform comparably with unconstrained models while being algorithmically simpler."}

As underlying models grow more powerful, researchers are exploring increasingly diverse conditioning signals, such as depth maps, edge maps, camera parameters, and reference images, to give users finer control over generation. Among different modalities, sketches are a natural and long-standing form of human communication, enabling rapid expression of visual concepts. Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions. We further introduce a novel loss that enables training on freehand sketches without requiring ground-truth pixel-aligned images. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches in both semantic alignment with freehand sketch inputs and in the realism and overall quality of the generated images."}

Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level.

Most existing benchmarks rely on recognition-style protocols such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Violation of Expectation (VoE), which can often be answered without committing to an explicit, testable physical hypothesis. We propose VisPhyWorld, an execution-based framework that evaluates physical reasoning by requiring models to generate executable simulator code from visual observations. By producing runnable code, the inferred world representation is directly inspectable, editable, and falsifiable. This separates physical reasoning from rendering. Building on this framework, we introduce VisPhyBench, comprising 209 evaluation scenes derived from 108 physical templates and a systematic protocol that evaluates how well models reconstruct appearance and reproduce physically plausible motion. Our pipeline produces valid reconstructed videos in 97.7% on the benchmark. Experiments show that while state-of-the-art MLLMs achieve strong semantic scene understanding, they struggle to accurately infer physical parameters and to simulate consistent physical dynamics."}

We present their theoretical foundations, algorithmic designs, and practical enhancements for robustness and scalability, examining how each addresses the fundamental nonconvexity of geometric estimation problems. Our analysis spans ten core vision tasks, from Wahba problem to bundle adjustment, revealing the optimality-robustness-scalability trade-offs that govern solver selection.

This paper provides a definitive answer: we prove that $β^\\star$-IPS, an estimator with an optimal additive baseline, asymptotically dominates SNIPS in Mean Squared Error. By analytically decomposing the variance gap, we show that SNIPS is asymptotically equivalent to using a specific -- but generally sub-optimal -- additive baseline. Our results theoretically justify shifting from self-normalisation to optimal baseline corrections for both ranking and recommendation."}

We present a controlled comparative study of three canonical convolutional neural network architectures - VGG, ResNet, and GoogLeNet - to isolate how depth influences classification performance, convergence behavior, and computational efficiency. By standardizing training protocols and explicitly distinguishing between nominal and effective depth, we show that the benefits of depth depend critically on architectural mechanisms that constrain its effective manifestation during training rather than on nominal depth alone. Although plain deep networks exhibit early accuracy saturation and optimization instability, residual and inception-based architectures consistently translate additional depth into improved accuracy at lower effective depth and favorable accuracy-compute trade-offs. These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks."}

While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs. Our results validate the effectiveness of leveraging hypergraph duality for self-supervised learning and establish a new paradigm for representation learning on challenging, unlabeled hypergraphs."}

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively. After rasterization, these meshes achieved a Dice score of 0.86 against manually delineated CH masks. Furthermore, these meshes could be used in renal urine flow simulations, providing valuable urodynamic information for clinical practice."}

However, they introduce significant ethical and legal risks, such as deepfakes and unauthorized use of copyrighted visual content. To address these risks, image immunization has emerged as a promising defense against AI-driven semantic manipulation. Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting. In addition, despite the inherent difficulty of universal perturbations, our method also achieves performance on par with image-specific methods under a more restricted perturbation budget, while also exhibiting strong black-box transferability across different diffusion models."}

In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\\varepsilon,δ)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set."}

However, we demonstrate through an extensive analysis that standard deterministic inversion (e.g. DDIM) fails when the source domain is spectrally sparse compared to the target domain (e.g., super-resolution, sketch-to-image). In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient. Extensive experiments on microscopy super-resolution (BBBC021) and sketch-to-image (Edges2Shoes) demonstrate that OVG effectively restores photorealistic textures while preserving structural fidelity."}

While there is extensive research on the role of image information for perceptual tasks, the role of the temporal dimension remains less well understood: What can we learn about the world from long-term motion information? What properties does long-term motion information have for visual learning? We leverage recent success in point-track estimation, which offers an excellent opportunity to learn temporal representations and experiment on a variety of perceptual tasks. We draw 3 clear lessons: 1) Long-term motion representations contain information to understand actions, but also objects, materials, and spatial information, often even better than images. 2) Long-term motion representations generalize far better than image representations in low-data settings and in zero-shot tasks. 3) The very low dimensionality of motion information makes motion representations a better trade-off between GFLOPs and accuracy than standard video representations, and used together they achieve higher performance than video representations alone. We hope these insights will pave the way for the design of future models that leverage the power of long-term motion information for perception."}

Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals.

In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm. Empirical evaluations on datasets from energy forecasting and algorithmic fairness show that our proposed method improves upon existing approaches and achieves unbiased predictions over subgroups, while remaining robust under distribution shift."}

Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step.

We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures.

Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation).

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions.

Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings."}

Active learning (AL) addresses this challenge by strategically selecting the most informative samples for the annotation purpose, but traditional methods solely rely on predictive uncertainty while ignoring whether models learn from clinically meaningful features a critical requirement for clinical deployment. We propose an explainability-guided active learning framework that integrates spatial attention alignment into a sample acquisition process. Our approach advocates for a dual-criterion selection strategy combining: (i) classification uncertainty to identify informative examples, and (ii) attention misalignment with radiologist-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) to target samples where the model focuses on incorrect features. By measuring misalignment between Grad-CAM attention maps and expert annotations using \\emph{Dice similarity}, our acquisition function judiciously identifies samples that enhance both predictive performance and spatial interpretability. We evaluate the framework using three expert-annotated medical imaging datasets, namely, BraTS (MRI brain tumors), VinDr-CXR (chest X-rays), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-rays). Using only 570 strategically selected samples, our explainability-guided approach consistently outperforms random sampling across all the datasets, achieving 77.22\\% accuracy on BraTS, 52.37\\% on VinDr-CXR, and 52.66\\% on SIIM-COVID. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that the models trained by our dual-criterion selection focus on diagnostically relevant regions, demonstrating that incorporating explanation guidance into sample acquisition yields superior data efficiency while maintaining clinical interpretability."}

Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks."}

However, most existing methods rely on restrictive assumptions, such as a fixed number of agents and fully synchronous action execution. These assumptions are often violated in urban systems, where the number of active agents varies over time, and actions may have heterogeneous durations, resulting in a semi-MARL setting. Moreover, while sharing policy parameters among agents is commonly adopted to improve learning efficiency, it can lead to highly homogeneous actions when a subset of agents make decisions concurrently under similar observations, potentially degrading coordination quality. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Value Decomposition (AVD), a cooperative MARL framework that adapts to a dynamically changing agent population. AVD further incorporates a lightweight mechanism to mitigate action homogenization induced by shared policies, thereby encouraging behavioral diversity and maintaining effective cooperation among agents. In addition, we design a training-execution strategy tailored to the semi-MARL setting that accommodates asynchronous decision-making when some agents act at different times. Experiments on real-world bike-sharing redistribution tasks in two major cities, London and Washington, D.C., demonstrate that AVD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its effectiveness and generalizability."}

Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias."}

Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring."}

Nevertheless, this vertical scaling strategy often encounters plateaus in exploration as the model becomes locked into specific thinking pattern.

In this paper, we first examine the role of visual partitioning in parallelized reasoning and subsequently propose two distinct strategies. Based on the above, we introduce Visual Para-Thinker, representing the inaugural parallel reasoning framework for MLLMs. To maintain path independence and promote diversity in reasoning, our approach integrates Pa-Attention alongside LPRoPE. Leveraging the vLLM framework, we have developed a native multimodal implementation that facilitates high-efficiency parallel processing.

Our contributions are two-fold: 1 We propose STAformer and STAformer plus plus, two novel attention-based architectures integrating frame-guided temporal pooling, dual image-video attention, and multiscale feature fusion to support STA predictions from an image-input video pair; 2 We introduce two novel modules to ground STA predictions on human behavior by modeling affordances. First, we integrate an environment affordance model which acts as a persistent memory of interactions that can take place in a given physical scene. We explore how to integrate environment affordances via simple late fusion and with an approach which adaptively learns how to best fuse affordances with end-to-end predictions. Second, we predict interaction hotspots from the observation of hands and object trajectories, increasing confidence in STA predictions localized around the hotspot. Our results show significant improvements on Overall Top-5 mAP, with gain up to +23p.p on Ego4D and +31p.p on a novel set of curated EPIC-Kitchens STA labels.

However, existing AI perovskite approaches focus predominantly on discrete models, including material design, process optimization,and property prediction. These models fail to propagate physical constraints across the workflow, hindering end-to-end optimization. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system for perovskite material discovery, named PeroMAS. We first encapsulated a series of perovskite-specific tools into Model Context Protocols (MCPs). By planning and invoking these tools, PeroMAS can design perovskite materials under multi-objective constraints, covering the entire process from literature retrieval and data extraction to property prediction and mechanism analysis. Furthermore, we construct an evaluation benchmark by perovskite human experts to assess this multi-agent system. Results demonstrate that, compared to single Large Language Model (LLM) or traditional search strategies, our system significantly enhances discovery efficiency. It successfully identified candidate materials satisfying multi-objective constraints. Notably, we verify PeroMAS's effectiveness in the physical world through real synthesis experiments."}

Rather than selecting a single reduced dimension or averaging results across dimensions, we exploit complementary advantages of multiple reduced dimensions. At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes."}

In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $τ$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $τ$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $τ$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \\log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss."}

Weakly-supervised variants mitigate annotation costs but remain constrained by the dataset-level train-and-fit paradigm with an inferior performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Agentic Spatio-Temporal Grounder (ASTG) framework for the task of STVG towards an open-world and training-free scenario. Specifically, two specialized agents SRA (Spatial Reasoning Agent) and TRA (Temporal Reasoning Agent) constructed leveraging on modern Multimoal Large Language Models (MLLMs) work collaboratively to retrieve the target tube in an autonomous and self-guided manner.

We also show that Masked diffusion models can be made approximately 12% more FLOPs-efficient when trained with a simple cross-entropy objective. We find that perplexity is informative within a diffusion family but can be misleading across families, where models with worse likelihood scaling may be preferable due to faster and more practical sampling, as reflected by the speed-quality Pareto frontier. These results challenge the view that Masked diffusion is categorically the future of diffusion language modeling and that perplexity alone suffices for cross-algorithm comparison.

Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation.

We conduct extensive experiments across various model architectures and multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that IDPruner achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior generalization across diverse architectures and tasks. Notably, on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, IDPruner retains 95.18\\% of baseline performance when pruning 75\\% of the tokens, and still maintains 86.40\\% even under an extreme 90\\% pruning ratio.

Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval."}

Yet producing high-fidelity articulated assets remains difficult to scale because it requires reliable part decomposition and kinematic rigging. Existing approaches largely fall into two paradigms: optimization-based reconstruction or distillation, which can be accurate but often takes tens of minutes to hours per instance, and inference-time methods that rely on template or part retrieval, producing plausible results that may not match the specific structure and appearance in the input observation. We introduce a part-centric generative framework for articulated object creation that synthesizes part geometry, composition, and articulation under explicit part-aware conditioning. Our representation models an object as a set of movable parts, each encoded by latent tokens augmented with part identity and articulation cues. Conditioned on a single image, the model generates articulated 3D assets that preserve instance-level correspondence while maintaining valid part structure and motion. The resulting approach avoids per-instance optimization, enables fast feed-forward inference, and supports controllable assembly and articulation, which are important for embodied interaction. Experiments on common articulated categories (e.g., drawers and doors) show improved input consistency, part accuracy, and articulation plausibility over optimization-based and retrieval-driven baselines, while substantially reducing inference time."}

A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the statistics of language exhibit a translation symmetry -- e.g., the co-occurrence probability of two months depends only on the time interval between them -- and we prove that the latter governs the aforementioned geometric structures in high-dimensional word embedding models. Moreover, we find that these structures persist even when the co-occurrence statistics are strongly perturbed (for example, by removing all sentences in which two months appear together) and at moderate embedding dimension. We show that this robustness naturally emerges if the co-occurrence statistics are collectively controlled by an underlying continuous latent variable. We empirically validate this theoretical framework in word embedding models, text embedding models, and large language models."}

Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification.

A novel \"Controlled Input\" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs.

We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning.

This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers."}

To close this gap, we propose MedScope, a tool-using clinical video reasoning model that performs coarse-to-fine evidence seeking over long-form procedures. By interleaving intermediate reasoning with targeted tool calls and verification on retrieved observations, MedScope produces more accurate and trustworthy predictions that are explicitly grounded in temporally localized visual evidence.

This study presents a decision-negative, human-in-the-loop agentic system that incorporates an adversarial self-critique mechanism as a bounded safety architecture for regulated underwriting workflows. Within this system, a critic agent challenges the primary agent's conclusions prior to submitting recommendations to human reviewers. This internal system of checks and balances addresses a critical gap in AI safety for regulated workflows. Additionally, the research develops a formal taxonomy of failure modes to characterize potential errors by decision-negative agents. This taxonomy provides a structured framework for risk identification and risk management in high-stakes applications. Experimental evaluation using 500 expert-validated underwriting cases demonstrates that the adversarial critique mechanism reduces AI hallucination rates from 11.3% to 3.8% and increases decision accuracy from 92% to 96%. At the same time, the framework enforces strict human authority over all binding decisions by design.

To fill these gaps, we applied semantic segmentation on Google Street View imageries to extract visual environmental features and proposed a Double Machine Learning framework to quantify their causal effects on regional crashes. Meanwhile, we utilized SHAP values to characterize the nonlinear influence mechanisms of confounding variables in the models and applied causal forests to estimate conditional average treatment effects. Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores.

This work argues that such limitations do not primarily arise from insufficient learning, data, or model capacity, but from a deeper structural property of how intelligence is optimized over time. We formulate intelligence as a trajectory-level phenomenon governed by multi-objective trade-offs, and introduce Trajectory-Dominant Pareto Optimization, a path-wise generalization of classical Pareto optimality in which dominance is defined over full trajectories. Within this framework, Pareto traps emerge as locally non-dominated regions of trajectory space that nevertheless restrict access to globally superior developmental paths under conservative local optimization. To characterize the rigidity of such constraints, we define the Trap Escape Difficulty Index (TEDI), a composite geometric measure capturing escape distance, structural constraints, and behavioral inertia. We show that dynamic intelligence ceilings arise as inevitable geometric consequences of trajectory-level dominance, independent of learning progress or architectural scale. We further introduce a formal taxonomy of Pareto traps and illustrate the resulting trajectory-level divergence using a minimal agent-environment model. Together, these results shift the locus of intelligence from terminal performance to optimization geometry, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and overcoming long-horizon developmental constraints in adaptive systems."}

Our evaluation shows that FOREST substantially improves the geometric agreement between predicted and true post-stow layouts compared with heuristic baselines. We further evaluate the predicted post-stow layouts in two downstream tasks, in which replacing the real post-stow masks with FOREST predictions causes only modest performance loss in load-quality assessment and multi-stow reasoning, indicating that our model can provide useful foresight signals for warehouse planning."}

While millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies enable gigabit data rates, they are highly susceptible to environmental factors, often leading to radio link failures (RLF). Predictive models leveraging radio and weather data have been proposed to address this issue; however, many operate as black boxes, offering limited transparency for operational deployment. This work bridges that gap by introducing a framework that combines explainability based feature pruning with model refinement. Our framework can be integrated into state of the art predictors such as GNN Transformer and LSTM based architectures for RLF prediction, enabling the development of accurate and explainability guided models in 5G networks. It provides insights into the contribution of input features and the decision making logic of neural networks, leading to lighter and more scalable models. When applied to RLF prediction, our framework unveils that weather data contributes minimally to the forecast in extensive real world datasets, which informs the design of a leaner model with 50 percent fewer parameters and improved F1 scores with respect to the state of the art solution.

We propose an explainability-guided active learning framework that integrates spatial attention alignment into a sample acquisition process. Our approach advocates for a dual-criterion selection strategy combining: (i) classification uncertainty to identify informative examples, and (ii) attention misalignment with radiologist-defined regions-of-interest (ROIs) to target samples where the model focuses on incorrect features. By measuring misalignment between Grad-CAM attention maps and expert annotations using \\emph{Dice similarity}, our acquisition function judiciously identifies samples that enhance both predictive performance and spatial interpretability. We evaluate the framework using three expert-annotated medical imaging datasets, namely, BraTS (MRI brain tumors), VinDr-CXR (chest X-rays), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-rays).

While SIMs offer unprecedented degrees of freedom for enhancing physical-layer security, their extremely large number of meta-atoms leads to a high-dimensional and strongly coupled optimization space, making conventional design approaches inefficient and difficult to scale. Moreover, existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques suffer from slow convergence and performance degradation in dynamic wireless environments with imperfect knowledge of passive eavesdroppers. To overcome these challenges, we propose a hybrid quantum proximal policy optimization (Q-PPO) framework for SIM-assisted secure communications, which jointly optimizes transmit power allocation and SIM phase shifts to maximize the average secrecy rate under power and quality-of-service constraints. Specifically, a parameterized quantum circuit is embedded into the actor network, forming a hybrid classical-quantum policy architecture that enhances policy representation capability and exploration efficiency in high-dimensional continuous action spaces. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed Q-PPO scheme consistently outperforms DRL baselines, achieving approximately 15% higher secrecy rates and 30% faster convergence under imperfect eavesdropper channel state information.

Another question is: how can we modify the input word so that it is no longer accepted? One may think that the automaton itself is an adequate explanation of its behaviour, but automata can be very complex and difficult to make sense of directly. In this work, we investigate how to explain the behaviour of an FA on an input word in terms of the word's characters. In particular, we are interested in minimal explanations: what is the minimal set of input characters that explains the result, and what are the minimal changes needed to alter the result?

To address these limitations, we propose Frequency-enhanced Hilbert scanning Mamba Framework (FH-Mamba) for short-term Arctic SIC prediction. Specifically, we introduce a 3D Hilbert scan mechanism that traverses the 3D spatiotemporal grid along a locality-preserving path, ensuring that adjacent indices in the flattened sequence correspond to neighboring voxels in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Additionally, we incorporate wavelet transform to amplify high-frequency details and we also design a Hybrid Shuffle Attention module to adaptively aggregate sequence and frequency features. Experiments conducted on the OSI-450a1 and AMSR2 datasets demonstrate that our FH-Mamba achieves superior prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines. The results confirm the effectiveness of Hilbert scanning and frequency-aware attention in improving both temporal consistency and edge reconstruction for Arctic SIC forecasting.

We investigate two methodologically different state-of-the-art XIL strategies, i.e., CAIPI and Right for the Right Reasons (RRR), as well as a novel hybrid approach that combines both strategies. The results are evaluated quantitatively by comparing segmentation masks with explanations generated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM) and Bounded Logit Attention (BLA). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in (i) guiding ML models to focus on relevant image features, particularly when CAIPI is used, and (ii) reducing model bias (i.e., balancing the misclassification rates between male and female predictions). Our analysis further supports the potential of XIL methods to improve fairness in gender classifiers. Overall, the increased transparency and fairness obtained by XIL leads to slight performance decreases with an exception being CAIPI, which shows potential to even improve classification accuracy."}

Minimizing overall prediction error often encourages models to prioritize informativeness over calibration, producing narrow but overconfident predictions. However, in safety-critical settings, trustworthy uncertainty estimates are often more valuable than narrow intervals. Realizing the problem, several recent works have focused on post-hoc corrections; however, existing methods either rely on weak notions of calibration (such as PIT uniformity) or impose restrictive parametric assumptions on the nature of the error. To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions. For efficient inference with real-valued targets, we introduce a novel characteristic kernel over distributions that can be evaluated in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ time for empirical distributions of size $n$. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior re-calibration approaches across a diverse set of regression benchmarks and model classes."}

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, GUI agents are often faced with non-stationary environments, leading to high computational costs for data curation and policy optimization. In this report, we introduce a novel MLLM-centered framework for GUI agents, which consists of two components: agentic-Q estimation and step-wise policy optimization. The former one aims to optimize a Q-model that can generate step-wise values to evaluate the contribution of a given action to task completion. The latter one takes step-wise samples from the state-action trajectory as inputs, and optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning with our agentic-Q model. It should be noticed that (i) all state-action trajectories are produced by the policy itself, so that the data collection costs are manageable; (ii) the policy update is decoupled from the environment, ensuring stable and efficient optimization. Empirical evaluations show that our framework endows Ovis2.5-9B with powerful GUI interaction capabilities, achieving remarkable performances on GUI navigation and grounding benchmarks and even surpassing contenders with larger scales."}

Deep learning has improved time-series anomaly detection, but most models are evaluated on one dataset at a time. This raises questions about whether these models can handle different types of telemetry, especially in large-scale and high-dimensional environments.\n  In this study, we evaluate four deep learning models, GRU, TCN, Transformer, and TSMixer. We also include Isolation Forest as a classical baseline. The models are tested across four telemetry datasets: the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark, Microsoft Cloud Monitoring dataset, Exathlon dataset, and IBM Console dataset. These datasets differ in structure, dimensionality, and labelling strategy. They include univariate time series, synthetic multivariate workloads, and real-world production telemetry with over 100,000 features.\n  We use a unified training and evaluation pipeline across all datasets. The evaluation includes NAB-style metrics to capture early detection behaviour for datasets where anomalies persist over contiguous time intervals. This enables window-based scoring in settings where anomalies occur over contiguous time intervals, even when labels are recorded at the point level. The unified setup enables consistent analysis of model behaviour under shared scoring and calibration assumptions.\n  Our results demonstrate that anomaly detection performance in cloud systems is governed not only by model architecture, but critically by calibration stability and feature-space geometry. By releasing our preprocessing pipelines, benchmark configuration, and evaluation artifacts, we aim to support reproducible and deployment-aware evaluation of anomaly detection systems for cloud environments."}

One of the most common applications of these LLM Agents is in computer programming, where agents can successfully work alongside humans to generate code while controlling programming environments or networking systems. However, with the increasing ability and complexity of these agents comes dangers about the potential for their misuse. A concerning application of LLM agents is in the domain cybersecurity, where they have the potential to greatly expand the threat imposed by attacks such as social engineering. This is due to the fact that LLM Agents can work autonomously and perform many tasks that would normally require time and effort from skilled human programmers. While this threat is concerning, little attention has been given to assessments of the capabilities of LLM coding agents in generating code for social engineering attacks. In this work we compare different LLMs in their ability and willingness to produce potentially dangerous code bases that could be misused by cyberattackers. The result is a dataset of 200 website code bases and logs from 40 different LLM coding agents. Analysis of models shows which metrics of LLMs are more and less correlated with performance in generating spear-phishing sites. Our analysis and the dataset we present will be of interest to researchers and practitioners concerned in defending against the potential misuse of LLMs in spear-phishing."}

To stabilize tactile embeddings, we further introduce a physics-informed regularization that encourages bilateral force balance, reflecting principles of human motor control. Experiments on the TacSL benchmark show that CMT with symmetry regularization achieves a 96.59% insertion success rate, surpassing naïve and gated fusion baselines and closely matching the privileged \"wrist + contact force\" configuration (96.09%). These results highlight two central insights: (i) tactile sensing is indispensable for precise alignment, and (ii) principled multimodal fusion, further strengthened by physics-informed regularization, unlocks complementary strengths of vision and touch, approaching privileged performance under realistic sensing."}

However, the evaluation methods used in the state-ofthe-art of HRRP generation rely on classification models. Such models, called ''black-box'', do not allow either explainability on generated data or multi-level evaluation. This work focuses on decomposing HRRP data into three components: the mask, the features, and the noise. Using this decomposition, we propose two metrics based on the physical interpretation of those data. We take profit from an expensive dataset to evaluate our metrics on a challenging task and demonstrate the discriminative ability of those."}

We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods.

Existing methods mainly rely on cross-modal alignment or inference-time prompting with Vision--Language Models (VLMs). These approaches do not explicitly learn structured event representations and often produce weak argument grounding in multimodal settings. To address these limitations, we propose RMPL, a Relation-aware Multi-task Progressive Learning framework for MEE under low-resource conditions. RMPL incorporates heterogeneous supervision from unimodal event extraction and multimedia relation extraction with stage-wise training. The model is first trained with a unified schema to learn shared event-centric representations across modalities.

In these contexts, the recovered latent from the input does not follow the expected isotropic Gaussian distribution. Instead it exhibits a signal with lower frequencies, locking target sampling to oversmoothed and texture-poor generations. We term this phenomenon spectral collapse. We observe that stochastic alternatives attempting to restore the noise variance tend to break the semantic link to the input, leading to structural drift. To resolve this structure-texture trade-off, we propose Orthogonal Variance Guidance (OVG), an inference-time method that corrects the ODE dynamics to enforce the theoretical Gaussian noise magnitude within the null-space of the structural gradient.

Our dataset contains 1000 human-created paintings scored on a 1-100 scale and paired with a short human-written description (content or artist explanation). Two expert raters evaluated each work using a five-dimension rubric (originality, color, texture, composition, content) and provided written critiques; we use an 80/20 train-test split. We add a lightweight regression head on the visual encoder output so the model can predict a numerical score and generate rubric-aligned feedback in a single forward pass.

Experiments show strong accuracy, achieving Pearson r > 0.97 and MAE about 3.95 on the 100-point scale. Qualitative evaluation indicates the generated feedback is semantically close to expert critiques (average SBERT cosine similarity = 0.798). The proposed approach bridges computer vision and art assessment and offers a scalable tool for creativity research and classroom feedback."}

In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy."}

This structure couples an abstract information-theoretic quantity -- the *coding rate* -- to a concrete biophysical variable -- the *firing rate* -- which enables a trade-off between coding fidelity and energy expenditure. Such a coupling arises naturally in the Poisson variational autoencoder (P-VAE) -- a brain-inspired generative model that encodes inputs as discrete spike counts and recovers a spiking form of *sparse coding* as a special case -- but is absent from standard Gaussian VAEs. To demonstrate that this metabolic cost structure is unique to the Poisson formulation, we compare the P-VAE against Grelu-VAE, a Gaussian VAE with ReLU rectification applied to latent samples, which controls for the non-negativity constraint. Across a systematic sweep of the KL term weighting coefficient $β$ and latent dimensionality, we find that increasing $β$ monotonically increases sparsity and reduces average spiking activity in the P-VAE. In contrast, Grelu-VAE representations remain unchanged, confirming that the effect is specific to Poisson statistics rather than a byproduct of non-negative representations. These results establish Poisson variational inference as a promising foundation for a resource-constrained theory of computation."}

However, most interactive systems remain fundamentally reactive, responding only to current sensory inputs within a short temporal window. Proactive social behavior, in contrast, requires deliberation over accumulated context and intent inference, which conflicts with the strict latency budget of real-time interaction. We present \\emph{ProAct}, a dual-system framework that reconciles this time-scale conflict by decoupling a low-latency \\emph{Behavioral System} for streaming multimodal interaction from a slower \\emph{Cognitive System} which performs long-horizon social reasoning and produces high-level proactive intentions. To translate deliberative intentions into continuous non-verbal behaviors without disrupting fluency, we introduce a streaming flow-matching model conditioned on intentions via ControlNet. This mechanism supports asynchronous intention injection, enabling seamless transitions between reactive and proactive gestures within a single motion stream. We deploy ProAct on a physical humanoid robot and evaluate both motion quality and interactive effectiveness. In real-world interaction user studies, participants and observers consistently prefer ProAct over reactive variants in perceived proactivity, social presence, and overall engagement, demonstrating the benefits of dual-system proactive control for embodied social interaction."}

Prior work on the 2-Sigma clinical simulation platform showed that manually annotated linguistic features could support jailbreak detection. However, reliance on manual annotation limited both scalability and expressiveness. In this study, we extend this framework by using experts' annotations of four core linguistic features (Professionalism, Medical Relevance, Ethical Behavior, and Contextual Distraction) and training multiple general-domain and medical-domain BERT-based LLM models to predict these features directly from text. The most reliable feature regressor for each dimension was selected and used as the feature extractor in a second layer of classifiers. We evaluate a suite of predictive models, including tree-based, linear, probabilistic, and ensemble methods, to determine jailbreak likelihood from the extracted features. Across cross-validation and held-out evaluations, the system achieves strong overall performance, indicating that LLM-derived linguistic features provide an effective basis for automated jailbreak detection. Error analysis further highlights key limitations in current annotations and feature representations, pointing toward future improvements such as richer annotation schemes, finer-grained feature extraction, and methods that capture the evolving risk of jailbreak behavior over the course of a dialogue. This work demonstrates a scalable and interpretable approach for detecting jailbreak behavior in safety-critical clinical dialogue systems."}

Prior work on backdoor attacks has largely focused on a black-box threat model, with an adversary targeting the model builder's LLM. However, in the bias manipulation setting, the model builder themselves could be the adversary, warranting a white-box threat model where the attacker's ability to poison, and manipulate the poisoned data is substantially increased. Furthermore, despite growing research in semantically-triggered backdoors, most studies have limited themselves to syntactically-triggered attacks. Motivated by these limitations, we conduct an analysis consisting of over 1000 evaluations using higher poisoning ratios and greater data augmentation to gain a better understanding of the potential of syntactically- and semantically-triggered backdoor attacks in a white-box setting. In addition, we study whether two representative defense paradigms, model-intrinsic and model-extrinsic backdoor removal, are able to mitigate these attacks. Our analysis reveals numerous new findings. We discover that while both syntactically- and semantically-triggered attacks can effectively induce the target behaviour, and largely preserve utility, semantically-triggered attacks are generally more effective in inducing negative biases, while both backdoor types struggle with causing positive biases. Furthermore, while both defense types are able to mitigate these backdoors, they either result in a substantial drop in utility, or require high computational overhead."}

Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a direct measurement of neural activity, yet EEG-based fatigue recognition is hindered by strong non-stationarity and asymmetric neural dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose DeltaGateNet, a novel framework that explicitly captures Bidirectional temporal dynamics for EEG-based driving fatigue recognition. Our key idea is to introduce a Bidirectional Delta module that decomposes first-order temporal differences into positive and negative components, enabling explicit modeling of asymmetric neural activation and suppression patterns. Furthermore, we design a Gated Temporal Convolution module to capture long-term temporal dependencies for each EEG channel using depthwise temporal convolutions and residual learning, preserving channel-wise specificity while enhancing temporal representation robustness. Extensive experiments conducted under both intra-subject and inter-subject evaluation settings on the public SEED-VIG and SADT driving fatigue datasets demonstrate that DeltaGateNet consistently outperforms existing methods. On SEED-VIG, DeltaGateNet achieves an intra-subject accuracy of 81.89% and an inter-subject accuracy of 55.55%. On the balanced SADT 2022 dataset, it attains intra-subject and inter-subject accuracies of 96.81% and 83.21%, respectively, while on the unbalanced SADT 2952 dataset, it achieves 96.84% intra-subject and 84.49% inter-subject accuracy.

We propose FlowHOI, a two-stage flow-matching framework that generates semantically grounded, temporally coherent HOI sequences, comprising hand poses, object poses, and hand-object contact states, conditioned on an egocentric observation, a language instruction, and a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) scene reconstruction. We decouple geometry-centric grasping from semantics-centric manipulation, conditioning the latter on compact 3D scene tokens and employing a motion-text alignment loss to semantically ground the generated interactions in both the physical scene layout and the language instruction. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity HOI supervision, we introduce a reconstruction pipeline that recovers aligned hand-object trajectories and meshes from large-scale egocentric videos, yielding an HOI prior for robust generation. Across the GRAB and HOT3D benchmarks, FlowHOI achieves the highest action recognition accuracy and a 1.7$\\times$ higher physics simulation success rate than the strongest diffusion-based baseline, while delivering a 40$\\times$ inference speedup.

To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes.

This paper proposes the Deferred Visual Ingestion (DVI) framework, adopting a demand-side ingestion strategy: the indexing phase performs only lightweight metadata extraction, deferring visual understanding to the moment users pose specific questions. DVI's core principle is \"Index for locating, not understanding\"--achieving page localization through structured metadata indexes and BM25 full-text search, then sending original images along with specific questions to a VLM for targeted analysis. Experiments on two real industrial engineering drawings (113 pages + 7 pages) demonstrate that DVI achieves comparable overall accuracy at zero ingestion VLM cost (46.7% vs. 48.9%), an effectiveness rate of 50% on visually necessary queries (vs. 0% for pre-ingestion), and 100% page localization (98% search space compression).

A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel nonparametric re-calibration algorithm based on conditional kernel mean embeddings, capable of correcting calibration error without restrictive modeling assumptions. For efficient inference with real-valued targets, we introduce a novel characteristic kernel over distributions that can be evaluated in $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ time for empirical distributions of size $n$.

However, the number of Gaussian primitives often grows substantially during training as finer scene details are reconstructed, leading to increased memory and storage costs.

In particular, AutoOpti3DGS employs the learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enable data-adaptive frequency modulation. Nevertheless, its modulation depth is limited by the 1-level DWT, and jointly optimizing wavelet regularization with 3D reconstruction introduces gradient competition that promotes excessive Gaussian densification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level DWT-based frequency modulation framework for 3DGS. By recursively decomposing the low-frequency subband, we construct a deeper curriculum that provides progressively coarser supervision during early training, consistently reducing Gaussian counts. Furthermore, we show that the modulation can be performed using only a single scaling parameter, rather than learning the full 2-tap high-pass filter.

Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\\pm$0.3\\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points.

We revisit the Platonic Representation Hypothesis with our calibration framework, which reveals a nuanced picture: the apparent convergence reported by global spectral measures largely disappears after calibration, while local neighborhood similarity, but not local distances, retains significant agreement across different modalities.

Using this taxonomy, we construct MT-AgentRisk (Multi-Turn Agent Risk Benchmark), the first benchmark to evaluate multi-turn tool-using agent safety. Our experiments reveal substantial safety degradation: the Attack Success Rate (ASR) increases by 16% on average across open and closed models in multi-turn settings. To close this gap, we propose ToolShield, a training-free, tool-agnostic, self-exploration defense: when encountering a new tool, the agent autonomously generates test cases, executes them to observe downstream effects, and distills safety experiences for deployment.

Unlike traditional visual interpretation tools that provide access through captions and OCR (text recognition through camera input), MLLM-enabled applications support access through conversational assistance, where users can ask questions to obtain goal-relevant details. However, evidence about their performance in the real-world and their implications for BLV people's everyday life remain limited. To address this, we conducted a two-week diary study, where we captured 20 BLV participants' use of an MLLM-enabled visual interpretation application. Although participants rated the visual interpretations of the application as \"somewhat trustworthy\" (mean=3.76 out of 5, max=very trustworthy) and \"somewhat satisfying\" (mean=4.13 out of 5, max=very satisfying), the AI often produced incorrect answers (22.2%) or abstained (10.8%) from responding to follow-up requests. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can improve the accuracy of descriptive visual interpretations, but that supporting everyday use also depends on the \"visual assistant\" skill -- a set of behaviors for providing goal-directed, reliable assistance. We conclude by proposing the \"visual assistant\" skill and practical guidelines to help future MLLM-enabled visual interpretation applications better support BLV people's access to visual information."}

Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results."}

FUTON implicitly expresses signals as weighted combinations of orthonormal, separable basis functions, combining complementary inductive biases: Fourier bases capture smoothness and periodicity, while the low-rank parameterization enforces low-dimensional spectral structure.

A critical challenge is directing an LLM to avoid specific, chemically sensitive sites on a molecule - a task where unconstrained generation can lead to invalid or undesirable synthetic pathways. In this work, we introduce Protect$^*$, a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rigorous chemical logic. Our approach combines automated rule-based reasoning - using a comprehensive database of 55+ SMARTS patterns and 40+ characterized protecting groups - with the generative intuition of neural models. The system operates via a hybrid architecture: an ``automatic mode'' where symbolic logic deterministically identifies and guards reactive sites, and a ``human-in-the-loop mode'' that integrates expert strategic constraints. Through ``active state tracking,'' we inject hard symbolic constraints into the neural inference process via a dedicated protection state linked to canonical atom maps. We demonstrate this neuro-symbolic approach through case studies on complex natural products, including the discovery of a novel synthetic pathway for Erythromycin B, showing that grounding neural generation in symbolic logic enables reliable, expert-level autonomy."}

Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms."}

We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines."}

Many ecological decisions are slowed by the gap between collecting and analysing biodiversity data.

In practice, however, adoption remains fragmented, with key architectural trade-offs, performance constraints, and implementation challenges rarely reported systematically. 2. Here, we analyse 82 studies published between 2017 and 2025 that implement edge computing for biodiversity monitoring across acoustic, vision, tracking, and multi-modal systems. We synthesise hardware platforms, AI model optimisation, and wireless communication to critically assess how design choices shape ecological inference, deployment longevity, and operational feasibility. 3.

To avoid expensive evaluations of the objective function and its gradient, we leverage trajectory data on the optimization variables to learn the continuous-time dynamics associated with gradient descent, Newton's method, and ADAM optimization. The discovered gradient flows are then solved as a surrogate for the original optimization problem. To this end, we introduce the Learned Gradient Flow (LGF) optimizer, which is equipped to build surrogate models of variable polynomial order in full- or reduced-dimensional spaces at user-defined intervals in the optimization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on several standard problems from engineering mechanics and scientific machine learning, including two inverse problems, structural topology optimization, and two forward solves with different discretizations. Our results suggest that the learned gradient flows can significantly expedite convergence by capturing critical features of the optimization trajectory while avoiding expensive evaluations of the objective and its gradient."}

To mitigate this, we introduce TrasMuon (\\textbf{T}rust \\textbf{R}egion \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{S}caling \\textbf{Muon}). TrasMuon preserves the near-isometric geometry of Muon while stabilizing magnitudes through (i) global RMS calibration and (ii) energy-based trust-region clipping.

TrasMuon addresses this by defining a trust region based on relative energy ratios, confining updates to a stable zone. Empirical experiments on vision and language models demonstrate that TrasMuon converges faster than baselines. Furthermore, experiments without warmup stages confirm TrasMuon's superior stability and robustness."}

Recently, several works suggest that making sparse attention trainable can further increase sparsity while preserving generation quality. We study three key questions: (1) when do the two common masking rules, i.e., Top-k and Top-p, fail, and how can we avoid these failures? (2) why can trainable sparse attention reach higher sparsity than training-free methods? (3) what are the limitations of fine-tuning sparse attention using the diffusion loss, and how can we address them? Based on this analysis, we propose SpargeAttention2, a trainable sparse attention method that achieves high sparsity without degrading generation quality. SpargeAttention2 includes (i) a hybrid masking rule that combines Top-k and Top-p for more robust masking at high sparsity, (ii) an efficient trainable sparse attention implementation, and (iii) a distillation-inspired fine-tuning objective to better preserve generation quality during fine-tuning using sparse attention.

This study addresses that gap by fine-tuning a Turkish-specific BERT model (dbmdz/bert-base-turkish-cased) on a labeled dataset of 3,600 articles from three major Turkish outlets with distinct editorial orientations for binary classification of AI-rewritten content. The model achieves 0.9708 F1 score on the held-out test set with symmetric precision and recall across both classes. Subsequent deployment on over 3,500 unseen articles spanning between 2023 and 2026 reveals consistent cross-source and temporally stable classification patterns, with mean prediction confidence exceeding 0.96 and an estimated 2.5 percentage of examined news content rewritten or revised by LLMs on average.

This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $γ$-weakly $θ$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $γ$, $θ$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints."}

Recently, NL2SQL agents, powered by the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly advanced NL2SQL translation. Nonetheless, NL2SQL agents still make mistakes when faced with large-scale real-world databases because they lack knowledge of how to correctly leverage the underlying data (e.g., knowledge about the intent of each column) and form misconceptions about the data when querying it, leading to errors. Prior work has studied generating facts about the database to provide more context to NL2SQL agents, but such approaches simply restate database contents without addressing the agent's misconceptions. In this paper, we propose Tk-Boost, a bolt-on framework for augmenting any NL2SQL agent with tribal knowledge: knowledge that corrects the agent's misconceptions in querying the database accumulated through experience using the database. To accumulate experience, Tk-Boost first asks the NL2SQL agent to answer a few queries on the database, identifies the agent's misconceptions by analyzing its mistakes on the database, and generates tribal knowledge to address them. To enable accurate retrieval, Tk-Boost indexes this knowledge with applicability conditions that specify the query features for which the knowledge is useful. When answering new queries, Tk-Boost uses this knowledge to provide feedback to the NL2SQL agent, resolving the agent's misconceptions during SQL generation, and thus improving the agent's accuracy. Extensive experiments across the BIRD and Spider 2.0 benchmarks with various NL2SQL agents shows Tk-Boost improves NL2SQL agents accuracy by up to 16.9% on Spider 2.0 and 13.7% on BIRD"}

In this work, we address this issue by integrating a self-supervised differentiable clustering model with a novel differentiable ILP model, enabling rule learning from raw data without explicit label leakage.

Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models."}

However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach."}

AISA first localizes intrinsic safety awareness via spatiotemporal analysis and shows that intent-discriminative signals are broadly encoded, with especially strong separability appearing in the scaled dot-product outputs of specific attention heads near the final structural tokens before generation. Using a compact set of automatically selected heads, AISA extracts an interpretable prompt-risk score with minimal overhead, achieving detector-level performance competitive with strong proprietary baselines on small (7B) models. AISA then performs logits-level steering: it modulates the decoding distribution in proportion to the inferred risk, ranging from normal generation for benign prompts to calibrated refusal for high-risk requests -- without changing model parameters, adding auxiliary modules, or requiring multi-pass inference. Extensive experiments spanning 13 datasets, 12 LLMs, and 14 baselines demonstrate that AISA improves robustness and transfer while preserving utility and reducing false refusals, enabling safer deployment even for weakly aligned or intentionally risky model variants."}

Based on commonly shared BEV features, we design a hiding network to prevent an image reconstruction network from recovering the input images from the shared features. An adversarial learning mechanism is employed to train the network, where the hiding network works to conceal the visual clues in the BEV features while the reconstruction network attempts to uncover these clues. To maintain segmentation performance, the perception network is integrated with the hiding network and optimized end-to-end. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PCC framework effectively degrades the quality of the reconstructed images with minimal impact on segmentation performance, providing privacy protection for cooperating vehicles.

Conventional approaches struggle to detect the subtle, early stages of intent drift, raising alarms only when degradation is significant and failure is imminent, which limits their effectiveness for proactive assurance. To address this, we propose LEAD-Drift, a framework that detects intent drift in real time to enable proactive failure prevention. LEAD-Drift's core contribution is reformulating intent failure detection as a supervised learning problem by training a lightweight neural network on fixed-horizon labels to predict a future risk score. The model's raw output is then smoothed with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and passed through a statistically tuned threshold to generate robust, real-time alerts. Furthermore, we enhance the framework with two key features for operational intelligence: a multi-horizon modeling technique for dynamic time-to-failure estimation, and per-alert explainability using SHAP to identify root-cause KPIs. Our evaluation on a time-series dataset shows LEAD-Drift provides significantly earlier warnings, improving the average lead time by 7.3 minutes (+17.8\\%) compared to a distance-based baseline. It also reduces alert noise by 80.2\\% compared to a weighted-KPI heuristic, with only a minor trade-off in lead time.

For safety alignment, the core challenge lies in the inherent trade-off between safety and utility. However, prevailing alignment strategies typically construct CoT training data with explicit safety rules via context distillation. This approach inadvertently limits reasoning capabilities by creating a rigid association between rule memorization and refusal. To mitigate the safety-utility trade-off, we propose the Adaptive Safe Context Learning (ASCL) framework to improve the reasoning given proper context. ASCL formulates safety alignment as a multi-turn tool-use process, empowering the model to autonomously decide when to consult safety rules and how to generate the ongoing reasoning. Furthermore, to counteract the preference for rule consultation during RL, we introduce Inverse Frequency Policy Optimization (IFPO) to rebalance advantage estimates.

In generalizing to multiple interrelated tables, it is essential to compress variably-sized RDB neighborhoods into fixed-length ICL samples for consumption by the decoder.

We propose the LLM-Confidence Reranker (LCR), a training-free, plug-and-play algorithm that enhances reranking in RAG systems by leveraging black-box LLM confidence derived from Maximum Semantic Cluster Proportion (MSCP). LCR employs a two-stage process: confidence assessment via multinomial sampling and clustering, followed by binning and multi-level sorting based on query and document confidence thresholds. This approach prioritizes relevant documents while preserving original rankings for high-confidence queries, ensuring robustness. Evaluated on BEIR and TREC benchmarks with BM25 and Contriever retrievers, LCR--using only 7--9B-parameter pre-trained LLMs--consistently improves NDCG@5 by up to 20.6% across pre-trained LLM and fine-tuned Transformer rerankers, without degradation. Ablation studies validate the hypothesis that LLM confidence positively correlates with document relevance, elucidating LCR's mechanism. LCR offers computational efficiency, parallelism for scalability, and broad compatibility, mitigating hallucinations in applications like medical diagnosis."}

This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94.

However, their integration with graph-based models of brain connectivity remains limited. In addition, most existing fMRI analysis methods rely on static Functional Connectivity (FC) representations, which obscure transient neural dynamics critical for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Recent state-space approaches, including Mamba, model temporal structure efficiently, but are typically used as standalone feature extractors without explicit high-level reasoning. We propose NeuroMambaLLM, an end-to-end framework that integrates dynamic latent graph learning and selective state-space temporal modelling with LLMs. The proposed method learns the functional connectivity dynamically from raw Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) time series, replacing fixed correlation graphs with adaptive latent connectivity while suppressing motion-related artifacts and capturing long-range temporal dependencies. The resulting dynamic brain representations are projected into the embedding space of an LLM model, where the base language model remains frozen and lightweight low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules are trained for parameter-efficient alignment. This design enables the LLM to perform both diagnostic classification and language-based reasoning, allowing it to analyze dynamic fMRI patterns and generate clinically meaningful textual reports."}

We identify a previously under-recognized vulnerability in this workflow, which we term Rubric-Induced Preference Drift (RIPD). Even when rubric edits pass benchmark validation, they can still produce systematic and directional shifts in a judge's preferences on target domains. Because rubrics serve as a high-level decision interface, such drift can emerge from seemingly natural, criterion-preserving edits and remain difficult to detect through aggregate benchmark metrics or limited spot-checking. We further show this vulnerability can be exploited through rubric-based preference attacks, in which benchmark-compliant rubric edits steer judgments away from a fixed human or trusted reference on target domains, systematically inducing RIPD and reducing target-domain accuracy up to 9.5% (helpfulness) and 27.9% (harmlessness). When these judgments are used to generate preference labels for downstream post-training, the induced bias propagates through alignment pipelines and becomes internalized in trained policies. This leads to persistent and systematic drift in model behavior. Overall, our findings highlight evaluation rubrics as a sensitive and manipulable control interface, revealing a system-level alignment risk that extends beyond evaluator reliability alone.

We formalize this phenomenon by modeling attention as a projection onto the convex hull of key vectors and analyzing its entropic (softmax-like) relaxation. Our main theoretical contribution is a face-stability theorem showing that, under a strict complementarity margin (a support gap (Δ) certified by KKT multipliers), entropic attention concentrates on a constant-size active face: the total mass assigned to inactive tokens decays exponentially as (\\exp(-Ω(Δ/\\varepsilon))), while the error on the active face scales linearly in the temperature/regularization parameter (\\varepsilon). This yields a practical criterion for when sparse long-context decoding is safe and provides a principled knob to trade accuracy for compute.\n  Building on these guarantees, we introduce Vashista Sparse Attention, a drop-in mechanism that maintains a small candidate set per query through a paging-style context selection strategy compatible with modern inference stacks. Across long-context evaluations, we observe stable constant-size effective support, strong wall-clock speedups, and minimal quality degradation in the regimes predicted by the support-gap diagnostics. Finally, we discuss deployment implications for privacy-sensitive and air-gapped settings, where interchangeable attention modules enable predictable latency and cost without external retrieval dependencies."}

However, adopting standard defined beamforming approach in highly dynamic vehicular environments often incurs high beam training overheads and reduction in the available airtime for communications, which is mainly due to exchanging pilot signals and exhaustive beam measurements. To this end, we present a multi-modal sensing and fusion learning framework as a potential alternative solution to reduce such overheads. In this framework, we first extract the representative features from the sensing modalities by modality specific encoders, then, utilize multi-head cross-modal attention to learn dependencies and correlations between different modalities, and subsequently fuse the multimodal features to obtain predicted top-k beams so that the best line-of-sight links can be proactively established. To show the generalizability of the proposed framework, we perform a comprehensive experiment in four different vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) scenarios from real world multimodal and 60 GHz mmWave wireless sensing data. The experiment reveals that the proposed framework (i) achieves up to 96.72% accuracy on predicting top-15 beams correctly, (ii) incurs roughly 0.77 dB average power loss, and (iii) improves the overall latency and beam searching space overheads by 86.81% and 76.56% respectively for top-15 beams compared to standard defined approach."}

However, text-to-3D generation remains challenging, primarily due to bottlenecks in learning discrete 3D representations. Specifically, existing approaches often suffer from information loss during encoding, causing representational distortion before the quantization process. This effect is further amplified by vector quantization, ultimately degrading the geometric coherence of text-conditioned 3D shapes. Moreover, the conventional two-stage training paradigm induces an objective mismatch between reconstruction and text-conditioned auto-regressive generation. To address these issues, we propose View-aware Auto-Regressive 3D (VAR-3D), which intergrates a view-aware 3D Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to convert the complex geometric structure of 3D models into discrete tokens. Additionally, we introduce a rendering-supervised training strategy that couples discrete token prediction with visual reconstruction, encouraging the generative process to better preserve visual fidelity and structural consistency relative to the input text. Experiments demonstrate that VAR-3D significantly outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and text-3D alignment."}

However, these benchmarks predominantly focus on implementation, overlooking the equally critical aspect of software design. This gap raises two pivotal questions: (1) Can LLMs handle software design? (2) Can LLMs write code following the specific designs? To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases. DesBench comprises 30 manually crafted Java projects that include requirement documents, design models, implementations, and acceptance tests, amounting to a total of 30 design models, 194 Java classes, and 737 test cases. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships. (3) Acceptance test cases generated by LLMs from functional requirements achieve code coverage quality comparable to those written by humans. Our research highlights the current limitations of LLMs in managing software design and calls for further investigation into new design methodologies and languages suitable for LLM-based development."}

To test our model, we conducted a large-scale online experiment (N = 1,256) on a financial decision-support system implementing different anthropomorphic designs. We found that anthropomorphism indirectly reduces risk perception by increasing both cognitive and affective trust. Domain knowledge moderates these paths: participants with low financial knowledge experience a negative indirect effect of perceived anthropomorphism on risk perception via cognitive trust, whereas those with high financial knowledge exhibit a positive direct and indirect effect. We discuss theoretical contributions to human-AI interaction and design implications for calibrating trust in anthropomorphic decision-support systems for responsible AI."}

In neural networks, activation functions significantly affect performance yet typical options (e.g., ReLU, Swish) operate only on feature values and do not account for missingness indicators or confidence scores. We propose Three-Channel Evolved Activations (3C-EA), which we evolve using Genetic Programming to produce multivariate activation functions f(x, m, c) in the form of trees that take (i) the feature value x, (ii) a missingness indicator m, and (iii) an imputation confidence score c. To make these activations useful beyond the input layer, we introduce ChannelProp, an algorithm that deterministically propagates missingness and confidence values via linear layers based on weight magnitudes, retaining reliability signals throughout the network. We evaluate 3C-EA and ChannelProp on datasets with natural and injected (MCAR/MAR/MNAR) missingness at multiple rates under identical preprocessing and splits.

Acoustic cues, by contrast, naturally encode rich interaction dynamics during contact, yet remain underexploited in current multimodal fusion literature. Most multimodal fusion approaches implicitly assume homogeneous roles across modalities, and thus design flat and symmetric fusion structures. However, this assumption is ill-suited for acoustic signals, which are inherently sparse and contact-driven. To achieve precise robotic manipulation through acoustic-informed perception, we propose a hierarchical representation fusion framework that progressively integrates audio, vision, and proprioception. Our approach first conditions visual and proprioceptive representations on acoustic cues, and then explicitly models higher-order cross-modal interactions to capture complementary dependencies among modalities. The fused representation is leveraged by a diffusion-based policy to directly generate continuous robot actions from multimodal observations. The combination of end-to-end learning and hierarchical fusion structure enables the policy to exploit task-relevant acoustic information while mitigating interference from less informative modalities. The proposed method has been evaluated on real-world robotic manipulation tasks, including liquid pouring and cabinet opening. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion frameworks, particularly in scenarios where acoustic cues provide task-relevant information not readily available from visual observations alone. Furthermore, a mutual information analysis is conducted to interpret the effect of audio cues in robotic manipulation via multimodal fusion."}

However, these methods underperform in multi-goal environments with sparse rewards, where actions must be linked to temporally distant outcomes. To address this limitation, we first propose MOC-HER, which integrates the Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) mechanism into the MOC framework. By relabeling goals from achieved outcomes, MOC-HER can solve sparse reward environments that are intractable for the original MOC. However, this approach is insufficient for object manipulation tasks, where the reward depends on the object reaching the goal rather than on the agent's direct interaction. This makes it extremely difficult for HRL agents to discover how to interact with these objects. To overcome this issue, we introduce Dual Objectives Hindsight Experience Replay (2HER), a novel extension that creates two sets of virtual goals. In addition to relabeling goals based on the object's final state (standard HER), 2HER also generates goals from the agent's effector positions, rewarding the agent for both interacting with the object and completing the task. Experimental results in robotic manipulation environments show that MOC-2HER achieves success rates of up to 90%, compared to less than 11% for both MOC and MOC-HER. These results highlight the effectiveness of our dual objective relabeling strategy in sparse reward, multi-goal tasks."}

Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions.

Classical Kalman filtering is a recursive algorithm that computes this same conditional law under dynamical assumptions; the conditional Gaussian law itself is therefore the underlying representational object, while the filter is one computational realization. In this sense, CGP provides the probabilistic foundation for Kalman-type methods as well as equivalent formulations as a strictly convex quadratic program (MAP estimation), RKHS-regularized regression, and classical regularization. Ens-CGP is the ensemble instantiation of this object, obtained by treating empirical ensemble moments as a (possibly low-rank) Gaussian prior and performing exact conditioning.

However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance."}

However, their application in domain-specific agricultural tasks, such as plant pathology, remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, comprehensive multimodal image--text datasets and benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce LeafNet, a comprehensive multimodal dataset, and LeafBench, a visual question-answering benchmark developed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of VLMs in understanding plant diseases. The dataset comprises 186,000 leaf digital images spanning 97 disease classes, paired with metadata, generating 13,950 question-answer pairs spanning six critical agricultural tasks. The questions assess various aspects of plant pathology understanding, including visual symptom recognition, taxonomic relationships, and diagnostic reasoning. Benchmarking 12 state-of-the-art VLMs on our LeafBench dataset, we reveal substantial disparity in their disease understanding capabilities. Our study shows performance varies markedly across tasks: binary healthy--diseased classification exceeds 90\\% accuracy, while fine-grained pathogen and species identification remains below 65\\%. Direct comparison between vision-only models and VLMs demonstrates the critical advantage of multimodal architectures: fine-tuned VLMs outperform traditional vision models, confirming that integrating linguistic representations significantly enhances diagnostic precision.

Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making."}

There is a rich literature establishing the asymptotic normality of rescaled SA iterates under fairly mild conditions. However, these asymptotic results do not quantify the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation in finite time. In this paper, we establish explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of the rescaled iterate at time k and the asymptotic Gaussian limit for various choices of step-sizes including constant and polynomially decaying. As an immediate consequence, we obtain tail bounds on the error of SA iterates at any time.\n  We obtain the sharp rates by first studying the convergence rate of the discrete Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process driven by general noise, whose stationary distribution is identical to the limiting Gaussian distribution of the rescaled SA iterates. We believe that this is of independent interest, given its connection to sampling literature. The analysis involves adapting Stein's method for Gaussian approximation to handle the matrix weighted sum of i.i.d. random variables. The desired finite-time bounds for SA are obtained by characterizing the error dynamics between the rescaled SA iterate and the discrete time O-U process and combining it with the convergence rate of the latter process."}

This leads to either overgeneralization and AI overreliance, or burdensome independent memorization. Indeed, related decision tasks can share explanatory factors, but with some notable differences; e.g., body mass index (BMI) affects the risks for heart disease and diabetes at the same rate, but chest pain is more indicative of heart disease. Similarly, models using different attributes for the same task still share signals; e.g., temperature and pressure affect air pollution but in opposite directions due to the ideal gas law. Leveraging transfer of learning, we propose Transferable XAI to enable users to transfer understanding across related domains by explaining the relationship between domain explanations using a general affine transformation framework applied to linear factor explanations. The framework supports explanation transfer across various domain types: translation for data subspace (subsuming prior work on Incremental XAI), scaling for decision task, and mapping for attributes. Focusing on task and attributes domain types, in formative and summative user studies, we investigated how well participants could understand AI decisions from one domain to another. Compared to single-domain and domain-independent explanations, Transferable XAI was the most helpful for understanding the second domain, leading to the best decision faithfulness, factor recall, and ability to relate explanations between domains. This framework contributes to improving the reusability of explanations across related AI applications by explaining factor relationships between subspaces, tasks, and attributes."}

MamaDino fuses frozen self-supervised DINOv3 ViT-S features with a trainable CNN encoder at 512x512 resolution, and aggregates bilateral breast information via a BilateralMixer to output a 3-year breast cancer risk score.

This study focuses on waste segregation, a crucial step in recycling processes to obtain raw material. Recent advancements in computer vision have significantly contributed to waste classification and recognition. In waste segregation, segmentation masks are essential for robots to accurately localize and pick objects from conveyor belts. The complexity of real-world waste environments, characterized by deformed items without specific patterns and overlapping objects, further complicates waste segmentation tasks. This paper proposes an Ensemble Learning approach to improve segmentation accuracy by combining high performing segmentation models, U-Net and FPN, using a weighted average method. U-Net excels in capturing fine details and boundaries in segmentation tasks, while FPN effectively handles scale variation and context in complex environments, and their combined masks result in more precise predictions. The dataset used closely mimics real-life waste scenarios, and preprocessing techniques were applied to enhance feature learning for deep learning segmentation models. The ensemble model, referred to as EL-4, achieved an IoU value of 0.8306, an improvement over U-Net's 0.8065, and reduced Dice loss to 0.09019 from FPN's 0.1183.

Yet the theoretical underpinning remains an open question. A central question is why only a few epochs of fine-tuning are typically sufficient to achieve strong performance on many different tasks. In this work, we approach this question by developing a statistical framework, combining rigorous early stopping theory with the attention-based Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) for LLMs, offering new theoretical insights on fine-tuning practices. Specifically, we formally extend classical NTK theory [Jacot et al., 2018] to non-random (i.e., pretrained) initializations and provide a convergence guarantee for attention-based fine-tuning. One key insight provided by the theory is that the convergence rate with respect to sample size is closely linked to the eigenvalue decay rate of the empirical kernel matrix induced by the NTK. We also demonstrate how the framework can be used to explain task vectors for multiple tasks in LLMs. Finally, experiments with modern language models on real-world datasets provide empirical evidence supporting our theoretical insights."}

To address this, we propose AuTAgent (Audio Tool Agent), a reinforcement learning framework that learns when and which tools to invoke. By employing a sparse-feedback training strategy with a novel Differential Reward mechanism, the agent learns to filter out irrelevant tools and invokes external assistance only when it yields a net performance gain over the base model. Experimental results confirm that AuTAgent complements the representation bottleneck of LALMs by providing verifiable acoustic evidence. It improves accuracy by 4.20% / 6.20% and 9.80% / 8.00% for open-source and closed-source backbones on the MMAU Test-mini and the MMAR benchmarks, respectively.

However, lengthy contexts significantly increase inference latency, as the computational cost of self-attention grows quadratically with sequence length. To mitigate this issue, context compression-particularly soft prompt compressio-has emerged as a widely studied solution, which converts long contexts into shorter memory embeddings via a trained compressor. Existing methods typically compress the entire context indiscriminately into a set of memory tokens, requiring the compressor to capture global dependencies and necessitating extensive pre-training data to learn effective patterns. Inspired by the chunking mechanism in human working memory and empirical observations of the spatial specialization of memory embeddings relative to original tokens, we propose Parallelized Iterative Compression (PIC). By simply modifying the Transformer's attention mask, PIC explicitly restricts the receptive field of memory tokens to sequential local chunks, thereby lowering the difficulty of compressor training. Experiments across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that PIC consistently outperforms competitive baselines, with superiority being particularly pronounced in high compression scenarios (e.g., achieving relative improvements of 29.8\\% in F1 score and 40.7\\% in EM score on QA tasks at the $64\\times$ compression ratio).

Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods.

We introduce OmniScience, a large-scale, high-fidelity multi-modal dataset comprising 1.5 million figure-caption-context triplets, spanning more than 10 major scientific disciplines. To obtain image caption data with higher information density and accuracy for multi-modal large-model training, we develop a dynamic model-routing re-captioning pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models to generate dense, self-contained descriptions by jointly synthesizing visual features, original figure captions, and corresponding in-text references authored by human scientists. The pipeline is further reinforced with rigorous quality filtering and alignment with human expert judgments, ensuring both factual accuracy and semantic completeness, and boosts the image-text multi-modal similarity score from 0.769 to 0.956. We further propose a caption QA protocol as a proxy task for evaluating visual understanding.

We study this procedure in overparameterized linear regression: an initial estimator is trained on noisy labels, and each subsequent iterate is trained on fresh covariates with noiseless pseudo-labels from the previous model. In the high-dimensional regime, we derive deterministic-equivalent recursions for the prediction risk and effective noise across iterations, and prove that the empirical quantities concentrate sharply around these limits. The recursion separates two competing forces: a systematic component that grows with iteration due to progressive signal forgetting, and a stochastic component that decays due to denoising via repeated data-dependent projections. Their interaction yields a $U$-shaped test-risk curve and an optimal early-stopping time. In spiked covariance models, iteration further acts as an iteration-dependent spectral filter that preserves strong eigendirections while suppressing weaker ones, inducing an implicit form of soft feature selection distinct from ridge regression. Finally, we propose an iterated generalized cross-validation criterion and prove its uniform consistency for estimating the risk along the self-training trajectory, enabling fully data-driven selection of the stopping time and regularization. Experiments on synthetic covariances validate the theory and illustrate the predicted denoising-forgetting trade-off."}

To address these limitations, we introduce MOTIF for efficient few-shot cross-embodiment transfer that decouples embodiment-agnostic spatiotemporal patterns, termed action motifs, from heterogeneous action data. Specifically, MOTIF first learns unified motifs via vector quantization with progress-aware alignment and embodiment adversarial constraints to ensure temporal and cross-embodiment consistency. We then design a lightweight predictor that predicts these motifs from real-time inputs to guide a flow-matching policy, fusing them with robot-specific states to enable action generation on new embodiments.

We propose a unified framework, FluxMem, that enables adaptive memory organization for LLM agents. Our framework equips agents with multiple complementary memory structures. It explicitly learns to select among these structures based on interaction-level features, using offline supervision derived from downstream response quality and memory utilization. To support robust long-horizon memory evolution, we further introduce a three-level memory hierarchy and a Beta Mixture Model-based probabilistic gate for distribution-aware memory fusion, replacing brittle similarity thresholds.

Under this geometry, linear aggregation induces inward collapse toward the manifold interior, distorting vector magnitude and direction and reducing embedding comparability. To address this inconsistency, Spherical Barycentric Aggregation (SBA) is introduced as a geometry-preserving aggregation operator that separates radial and angular components to maintain hyperspherical structure while remaining fully compatible with existing routing mechanisms. Experiments on selected tasks from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), including semantic similarity, clustering, and duplicate question detection, demonstrate consistent performance improvements with identical training cost and full stability.

In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training. We theoretically prove that this design explicitly serves as a crucial boundary condition, thereby improving learning accuracy and enhancing policy expressiveness.

To provide a more structured alternative, we model latent thought exploration as conditional sampling from learnable densities and instantiate this idea as a Gaussian Thought Sampler (GTS). GTS predicts context-dependent perturbation distributions over continuous reasoning states and is trained with GRPO-style policy optimization while keeping the backbone frozen. Experiments on GSM8K with two latent reasoning architectures show that GTS achieves more reliable inference-time scaling than heuristic baselines.

This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible."}

This paper posits that this limitation arises from a structural property of contemporary LLMs: when provided with rich context, the space of future generations becomes strongly constrained, and the generation process is effectively governed by near-deterministic dynamics. Recent approaches such as test-time scaling and context adaptation improve performance but do not fundamentally alter this constraint. To address this issue, we propose Algebraic Quantum Intelligence (AQI) as a computational framework that enables systematic expansion of semantic space. AQI is formulated as a noncommutative algebraic structure inspired by quantum theory, allowing properties such as order dependence, interference, and uncertainty to be implemented in a controlled and designable manner. Semantic states are represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their evolution is governed by C-values computed from noncommutative operators, thereby ensuring the coexistence and expansion of multiple future semantic possibilities. In this study, we implement AQI by extending a transformer-based LLM with more than 600 specialized operators. We evaluate the resulting system on creative reasoning benchmarks spanning ten domains under an LLM-as-a-judge protocol. The results show that AQI consistently outperforms strong baseline models, yielding statistically significant improvements and reduced cross-domain variance. These findings demonstrate that noncommutative algebraic dynamics can serve as a practical and reproducible foundation for machine creativity.

Inspired by recent advances in generative reward modeling, we propose the Generative Speech Reward Model (GSRM), a reasoning-centric reward model tailored for speech. The GSRM is trained to decompose speech naturalness evaluation into an interpretable acoustic feature extraction stage followed by feature-grounded chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling explainable judgments. To achieve this, we curated a large-scale human feedback dataset comprising 31k expert ratings and an out-of-domain benchmark of real-world user-assistant speech interactions. Experiments show that GSRM substantially outperforms existing speech naturalness predictors, achieving model-human correlation of naturalness score prediction that approaches human inter-rater consistency.

A key to generalization lies in understanding functional parts (e.g., door handles and knobs), which indicate where and how to manipulate across diverse object categories and shapes. Previous works attempted to achieve generalization by introducing foundation features, while these features are mostly 2D-based and do not specifically consider functional parts. When lifting these 2D features to geometry-profound 3D space, challenges arise, such as long runtimes, multi-view inconsistencies, and low spatial resolution with insufficient geometric information. To address these issues, we propose Part-Aware 3D Feature Field (PA3FF), a novel dense 3D feature with part awareness for generalizable articulated object manipulation. PA3FF is trained by 3D part proposals from a large-scale labeled dataset, via a contrastive learning formulation. Given point clouds as input, PA3FF predicts a continuous 3D feature field in a feedforward manner, where the distance between point features reflects the proximity of functional parts: points with similar features are more likely to belong to the same part. Building on this feature, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Policy (PADP), an imitation learning framework aimed at enhancing sample efficiency and generalization for robotic manipulation. We evaluate PADP on several simulated and real-world tasks, demonstrating that PA3FF consistently outperforms a range of 2D and 3D representations in manipulation scenarios, including CLIP, DINOv2, and Grounded-SAM. Beyond imitation learning, PA3FF enables diverse downstream methods, including correspondence learning and segmentation tasks, making it a versatile foundation for robotic manipulation.

We identify four failure modes that cause baseline CUAs to degrade from 16.7% to 8.7% completion as load scales 25% to 100%, a pattern consistent across three independent implementations. These failure modes are context saturation (O(N) vs O(1) growth), memory interference, dependency complexity (DAGs vs. chains), and reprioritization overhead.

It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization."}

By integrating a temporal filter based on optical flow analysis for detecting inter-frame redundancy and a spatial filter leveraging saliency detection for identifying visually significant regions, Sali-Cache intelligently manages memory allocation before entering computationally expensive attention operations. Experimental evaluation on the LLaVA 1.6 architecture demonstrates that our method achieves a 2.20x compression ratio in effective memory usage while maintaining 100% accuracy across BLEU, ROUGE-L, and Exact Match metrics.

Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) model dynamic graphs by updating node embeddings over time; however, their predictive accuracy under sparse conditions remains limited. In this study, we improve the TGN framework by extracting enclosing subgraphs around candidate links, enabling the model to jointly learn structural and temporal information.

Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) mitigates this issue by considering client-specific models. A widely adopted approach in PFL decomposes neural networks into a shared feature extractor and client-specific heads. While effective, this design induces a fundamental tradeoff: deep or expressive shared components hinder personalization, whereas large local heads exacerbate overfitting under limited per-client data. Most existing methods rely on rigid, shallow heads, and therefore fail to navigate this tradeoff in a principled manner. In this work, we propose a boosting-inspired framework that enables a smooth control of this tradeoff. Instead of training a single personalized model, we construct an ensemble of $T$ models for each client. Across boosting iterations, the depth of the personalized component are progressively increased, while its effective complexity is systematically controlled via low-rank factorization or width shrinkage. This design simultaneously limits overfitting and substantially reduces per-client bias by allowing increasingly expressive personalization. We provide theoretical analysis that establishes generalization bounds with favorable dependence on the average local sample size and the total number of clients. Specifically, we prove that the complexity of the shared layers is effectively suppressed, while the dependence on the boosting horizon $T$ is controlled through parameter reduction. Notably, we provide a novel nonlinear generalization guarantee for decoupled PFL models. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets (e.g., EMNIST, CIFAR-10/100, and Sent140) demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PFL methods under heterogeneous data distributions."}

This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting."}

By scoring an observed partial trajectory with each learned goal-directed policy in a single forward pass, GRAIL retains the one-shot inference capability of classical goal recognition while leveraging learned policies that can capture suboptimal and systematically biased behavior. Across the evaluated domains, GRAIL increases the F1-score by more than 0.5 under systematically biased optimal behavior, achieves gains of approximately 0.1-0.3 under suboptimal behavior, and yields improvements of up to 0.4 under noisy optimal trajectories, while remaining competitive in fully optimal settings.

We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable.

We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks.

We present STATe-of-Thoughts (STATe), an interpretable ITC method that searches over high-level reasoning patterns. STATe replaces stochastic sampling with discrete and interpretable textual interventions: a controller selects actions encoding high-level reasoning choices, a generator produces reasoning steps conditioned on those choices, and an evaluator scores candidates to guide search. This structured approach yields three main advantages. First, action-guided textual interventions produce greater response diversity than temperature-based sampling. Second, in a case study on argument generation, STATe's explicit action sequences capture interpretable features that are highly predictive of output quality. Third, estimating the association between performance and action choices allows us to identify promising yet unexplored regions of the action space and steer generation directly toward them.

Among these, Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) has emerged as a key scenario, which utilizes a trigger item (explicitly represents a user's instantaneous interest), enabling precise, real-time recommendations. Although several trigger-based techniques have been proposed, most of them struggle to address the intent myopia issue, that is, a recommendation system overemphasizes the role of trigger items and narrowly focuses on suggesting commodities that are highly relevant to trigger items. Meanwhile, existing methods rely on collaborative behavior patterns between trigger and recommended items to identify the user's preferences, yet the sparsity of ID-based interaction restricts their effectiveness. To this end, we propose the Deep Adaptive Intent-Aware Network (DAIAN) that dynamically adapts to users' intent preferences. In general, we first extract the users' personalized intent representations by analyzing the correlation between a user's click and the trigger item, and accordingly retrieve the user's related historical behaviors to mine the user's diverse intent. Besides, sparse collaborative behaviors constrain the performance in capturing items associated with user intent. Hence, we reinforce similarity by leveraging a hybrid enhancer with ID and semantic information, followed by adaptive selection based on varying intents. Experimental results on public datasets and our industrial e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DAIAN."}

In parallel, research on automated and AI-assisted peer review has proliferated. Despite this momentum, empirical progress remains constrained by several critical limitations in existing datasets. While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric. This bias is reinforced by a narrow focus on data from computer science venues. Furthermore, these datasets lack precise alignment between reviewer comments and specific manuscript versions, obscuring the iterative relationship between peer review and manuscript evolution. In response, we introduce FMMD, a multimodal and multidisciplinary open peer review dataset curated from F1000Research. The dataset bridges the current gap by integrating manuscript-level visual and structural data with version-specific reviewer reports and editorial decisions. By providing explicit alignment between reviewer comments and the exact article iteration under review, FMMD enables fine-grained analysis of the peer review lifecycle across diverse scientific domains. FMMD supports tasks such as multimodal issue detection and multimodal review comment generation. It provides a comprehensive empirical resource for the development of peer review research."}

Recent work attempts to use learned world models as simulators for policy optimization, yet closed-loop imagined rollouts inevitably suffer from hallucination and long-horizon error accumulation. Such errors do not merely degrade visual fidelity; they corrupt the optimization signal, encouraging policies to exploit model inaccuracies rather than genuine task progress. We propose WoVR, a reliable world-model-based reinforcement learning framework for post-training VLA policies. Instead of assuming a faithful world model, WoVR explicitly regulates how RL interacts with imperfect imagined dynamics. It improves rollout stability through a controllable action-conditioned video world model, reshapes imagined interaction to reduce effective error depth via Keyframe-Initialized Rollouts, and maintains policy-simulator alignment through World Model-Policy co-evolution. Extensive experiments on LIBERO benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation demonstrate that WoVR enables stable long-horizon imagined rollouts and effective policy optimization, improving average LIBERO success from 39.95% to 69.2% (+29.3 points) and real-robot success from 61.7% to 91.7% (+30.0 points).

Building on the information bottleneck principle, we conceptualize explanations as compressed representations that retain only the information essential for producing correct answers.To operationalize this view, we introduce an evaluation pipeline that constrains explanation length and assesses sufficiency using multiple language models on the ARC Challenge dataset. To broaden the scope, we conduct experiments in both English, using the original dataset, and Persian, as a resource-limited language through translation.

In this work, we propose Critique-Resilient Benchmarking, an adversarial framework designed to compare models even when full human understanding is infeasible. Our technique relies on the notion of critique-resilient correctness: an answer is deemed correct if no adversary has convincingly proved otherwise. Unlike standard benchmarking, humans serve as bounded verifiers and focus on localized claims, which preserves evaluation integrity beyond full comprehension of the task. Using an itemized bipartite Bradley-Terry model, we jointly rank LLMs by their ability to solve challenging tasks and to generate difficult yet solvable questions. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in the mathematical domain across eight frontier LLMs, showing that the resulting scores are stable and correlate with external capability measures. Our framework reformulates benchmarking as an adversarial generation-evaluation game in which humans serve as final adjudicators."}

It is often assumed that coalitions are disjoint and preferences are fully known, which may not hold in practice. In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings."}

Our study identifies practical guidelines and insights: (1) SFT based on rejection sampling greatly outperforms rationalization-based supervision, which can introduce hallucinations due to ground-truth leakage. (2) While increased SFT epochs constantly benefit preference optimization, excessive SFT inhibits self-exploration during RL, ultimately limiting performance gains. (3) Coarse-grained reward signals often mislead RL, whereas fine-grained root-cause judgments ensure reliable credit assignment. Specification-based rewards offer further benefits but incur significant effort in specification generation. (4) Although filtering extremely hard-to-detect vulnerability samples improves RL training efficiency, the cost of performance loss should be considered in practical applications.

To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens.

Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks.

Its application to machine learning (ML) has gained significant attention, particularly for secure inference services deployed across multiple cloud virtual machines (VMs), where each VM acts as an MPC party.

While MPC provides strong cryptographic guarantees, it incurs substantial computational and communication overhead. Deep neural networks rely heavily on convolutional and fully connected layers, which require costly matrix multiplications in MPC. To reduce this cost, we propose leveraging low-rank decomposition (LRD) for linear layers, replacing one large matrix multiplication with two smaller ones. Each matrix multiplication in MPC incurs a round of communication, meaning decomposing one matrix multiplication into two leads to an additional communication round. Second, the added matrix multiplication requires an additional truncation step to maintain numerical precision. Since truncation itself requires communication and computation, these overheads can offset the gains from decomposition. To address this, we introduce two complementary optimizations: truncation skipping and efficient linear layer concatenation. Truncation skipping removes the extra truncation induced by LRD, while linear layer concatenation pipelines operations to hide the additional communication round. Together, these techniques mitigate the main overheads of LRD in MPC and improve overall efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across MPC protocols. Experiments show up to 25% speedup in n-PC and 33% in 3-PC protocols over full-rank baselines, along with up to 52% GPU energy savings and 88% reduction in offline-phase latency."}

LLM-based methods have emerged as powerful tools for this task by leveraging human-like social questionnaire responses to model group behaviors. Existing LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on group-level values at discrete time points, treating them as static snapshots rather than dynamic processes. However, group-level values are not fixed but shaped by long-term social changes. Modeling their dynamics is thus crucial for accurate social evolution prediction--a key challenge in both data mining and social science. This problem remains underexplored due to limited longitudinal data, group heterogeneity, and intricate historical event impacts.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for group-level dynamic social simulation by integrating historical value trajectories into LLM-based human response modeling. We select China and the U.S. as representative contexts, conducting stratified simulations across four core sociodemographic dimensions (gender, age, education, income). Using the World Values Survey, we construct a multi-wave, group-level longitudinal dataset to capture historical value evolution, and then propose the first event-based prediction method for this task, unifying social events, current value states, and group attributes into a single framework. Evaluations across five LLM families show substantial gains: a maximum 30.88\\% improvement on seen questions and 33.97\\% on unseen questions over the Vanilla baseline. We further find notable cross-group heterogeneity: U.S. groups are more volatile than Chinese groups, and younger groups in both countries are more sensitive to external changes. These findings advance LLM-based social simulation and provide new insights for social scientists to understand and predict social value changes."}

Despite the rapid advancement, our understanding of how RTs support reasoning, and the limits of this paradigm, remain incomplete. To promote greater clarity, we introduce PITA: a novel large-scale dataset of over 23 million statements in propositional logic and their corresponding proofs. As a benchmark for robust reasoning, we focus on length generalization: if a model is trained to determine truth or falsity on statements with proofs up to fixed length, how well does it generalize to statements requiring longer proofs? We propose notions of (1) task depth and (2) task breadth, which measure respectively (1) the number of steps required to solve an example from a task and (2) the number of unique examples across a task. We vary these quantities across subsets of PITA, and find that RT models generalize well on broad and shallow subsets, while deteriorating on narrow and deep subsets relative to non-RT baselines. To determine whether our results are idiosyncratic to PITA or indicative of general phenomena, we compare our results to a simple synthetic task based on syllogisms. Our resulting theory suggests fundamental scalings that limit how well RT models perform on deep tasks, and highlights their generalization strengths on broad tasks. Our findings overall identify fundamental benefits and limitations inherent in using reasoning traces."}

In real-world deployments, forecasting models must operate under structural and observational uncertainties, conditions that are rarely considered in model design. Recent approaches achieve strong short-term predictive performance by tightly coupling spatial and temporal modeling, often at the cost of increased complexity and limited modularity. In contrast, efficient time-series models capture long-range temporal dependencies without relying on explicit network structure. We propose UniST-Pred, a unified spatio-temporal forecasting framework that first decouples temporal modeling from spatial representation learning, then integrates both through adaptive representation-level fusion. To assess robustness of the proposed approach, we construct a dataset based on an agent-based, microscopic traffic simulator (MATSim) and evaluate UniST-Pred under severe network disconnection scenarios. Additionally, we benchmark UniST-Pred on standard traffic prediction datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance against existing well-established models despite a lightweight design. The results illustrate that UniST-Pred maintains strong predictive performance across both real-world and simulated datasets, while also yielding interpretable spatio-temporal representations under infrastructure disruptions.

In the first stage, we learn a scoring function by minimizing a scale-invariant ranking loss; in the second, we recover the target scale via isotonic regression. We theoretically characterize a class of \"Optimal-in-Rank-Order\" objectives -- including variants of RankNet and Gini covariance -- and prove that they recover the ordering of the true conditional mean under mild assumptions. We further show that subsequent monotone calibration guarantees recovery of the true regression function. Empirically, CAIRO combines the representation learning of neural networks with the robustness of rank-based statistics.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models."}

We propose a behavioral framework that profiles factual knowledge at the level of facts rather than questions, characterizing each fact by whether it is encoded, and then by how accessible it is: cannot be recalled, can be directly recalled, or can only be recalled with inference-time computation (thinking). To support such profiling, we introduce WikiProfile, a new benchmark constructed via an automated pipeline with a prompted LLM grounded in web search. Across 4 million responses from 13 LLMs, we find that encoding is nearly saturated in frontier models on our benchmark, with GPT-5 and Gemini-3 encoding 95--98% of facts. However, recall remains a major bottleneck: many errors previously attributed to missing knowledge instead stem from failures to access it. These failures are systematic and disproportionately affect long-tail facts and reverse questions. Finally, we show that thinking improves recall and can recover a substantial fraction of failures, indicating that future gains may rely less on scaling and more on methods that improve how models utilize what they already encode."}

Prompt-based approaches rely on language-only inference or one-pass program generation without step-level verification. Agent-based approaches use tools in a closed loop, but verification is often local and backtracking is limited, allowing errors to propagate and increasing cost. Moreover, they rely on chain- or beam-style trajectories that are typically combinatorially redundant, leading to high token costs. In this paper, we propose TabTracer, an agentic framework that coordinates multi-step tool calls over intermediate table states, with explicit state tracking for verification and rollback. First, it enforces step-level verification with typed operations and lightweight numeric and format checks to provide reliable rewards and suppress hallucinations. Second, execution-feedback Monte Carlo Tree Search maintains a search tree of candidate table states and uses backpropagated reflection scores to guide UCB1 selection and rollback via versioned snapshots. Third, it reduces redundancy with budget-aware pruning, deduplication, and state hashing with a monotonicity gate to cut token cost. Comprehensive evaluation on TabFact, WikiTQ, and CRT datasets shows that TabTracer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 6.7% in accuracy while reducing token consumption by 59--84%."}

First, we consider sampling from a target distribution with density proportional to $\\exp(-f(x))$ supported on a convex set $K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, where $f$ is convex. The main challenge is enforcing feasibility without degrading mixing. Using an epigraph transformation, we reduce this task to sampling from a nearly uniform distribution over a lifted convex set in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$. We then solve the lifted problem using a proximal sampler. Assuming only a separation oracle for $K$ and a subgradient oracle for $f$, we develop an implementation of the proximal sampler based on the cutting-plane method and rejection sampling. Unlike existing constrained samplers that rely on projection, reflection, barrier functions, or mirror maps, our approach enforces feasibility using only minimal oracle access, resulting in a practical and unbiased sampler without knowing the geometry of the constraint set.\n  Second, we study composite sampling, where the target is proportional to $\\exp(-f(x)-h(x))$ with closed and convex $f$ and $h$. This composite structure is standard in Bayesian inference with $f$ modeling data fidelity and $h$ encoding prior information. We reduce composite sampling via an epigraph lifting of $h$ to constrained sampling in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$, which allows direct application of the constrained sampling algorithm developed in the first part. This reduction results in a double epigraph lifting formulation in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$, on which we apply a proximal sampler. By keeping $f$ and $h$ separate, we further demonstrate how different combinations of oracle access (such as subgradient and proximal) can be leveraged to construct separation oracles for the lifted problem. For both sampling problems, we establish mixing time bounds measured in Rényi and $χ^2$ divergences."}

In parallel, recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling a shift from isolated AI models toward agentic AI systems that can interpret goals, coordinate multiple models and control functions, and adapt their behavior over time. This article proposes a multi-scale agentic AI framework for O-RAN that organizes RAN intelligence as a coordinated hierarchy across the Non-Real-Time (Non-RT), Near-Real-Time (Near-RT), and Real-Time (RT) control loops: (i) A Large Language Model (LLM) agent in the Non-RT RIC translates operator intent into policies and governs model lifecycles. (ii) Small Language Model (SLM) agents in the Near-RT RIC execute low-latency optimization and can activate, tune, or disable existing control applications; and (iii) Wireless Physical-layer Foundation Model (WPFM) agents near the distributed unit provide fast inference close to the air interface. We describe how these agents cooperate through standardized O-RAN interfaces and telemetry. Using a proof-of-concept implementation built on open-source models, software, and datasets, we demonstrate the proposed agentic approach in two representative scenarios: robust operation under non-stationary conditions and intent-driven slice resource control."}

Standard probabilistic model checkers operate on the full state space, which becomes infeasible for larger MDPs, and cannot explain why a learned policy makes particular decisions. COOL-MC wraps the model checker Storm but adds three key capabilities: it constructs only the reachable state space induced by a trained policy, yielding a smaller discrete-time Markov chain amenable to verification even when full-MDP analysis is intractable; it automatically labels states with clinically meaningful atomic propositions; and it integrates explainability methods with probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) queries to reveal which features drive decisions across treatment trajectories. We demonstrate COOL-MC's capabilities on the ICU-Sepsis MDP, a benchmark derived from approximately 17,000 sepsis patient records, which serves as a case study for applying COOL-MC to the formal analysis of sepsis treatment policies. Our analysis establishes hard bounds via full MDP verification, trains a safe RL policy that achieves optimal survival probability, and analyzes its behavior via PCTL verification and explainability on the induced DTMC. This reveals, for instance, that our trained policy relies predominantly on prior dosing history rather than the patient's evolving condition, a weakness that is invisible to standard evaluation but is exposed by COOL-MC's integration of formal verification and explainability. Our results illustrate how COOL-MC could serve as a tool for clinicians to investigate and debug sepsis treatment policies before deployment."}

The proposed model is called DenseMLLM, grounded in the standard architecture with a novel vision token supervision strategy for multiple labels and tasks. Despite its minimalist design, our model achieves highly competitive performance across a wide range of dense prediction and vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that a standard, general-purpose MLLM can effectively support dense perception without architectural specialization."}

We examine this fundamental question by evaluating whether LLMs genuinely reason mathematically in these languages or depend on implicit translation to English-like representations. Using a taxonomy of six math problem types, from basic arithmetic to complex unit conflict and optimization problems, we evaluate four prominent large language models. To avoid translation artifacts that confound language ability with translation quality, we construct a parallel dataset where each problem is natively authored by fluent speakers with mathematical training in all three languages. Our analysis demonstrates that while basic arithmetic reasoning transfers robustly across languages, complex reasoning tasks show significant degradation in Tamil and Sinhala. The pattern of failures varies by model and problem type, suggesting that apparent multilingual competence may not reflect uniform reasoning capabilities across languages. These findings challenge the common assumption that models exhibiting strong multilingual performance can reason equally effectively across languages, and highlight the need for fine-grained, type-aware evaluation in multilingual settings."}

In terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95], the YOLOv11x model achieved the best accuracy of 80.1%.

We propose a multi-agent medical QA framework that combines complementary LLMs with evidence retrieval, uncertainty estimation, and bias checks to improve answer reliability. Our approach has two phases. First, we fine-tune three representative LLM families (GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek R1) on MedQuAD-derived medical QA data (20k+ question-answer pairs across multiple NIH domains) and benchmark generation quality. DeepSeek R1 achieves the strongest scores (ROUGE-1 0.536 +- 0.04; ROUGE-2 0.226 +-0.03; BLEU 0.098 -+ 0.018) and substantially outperforms the specialised biomedical baseline BioGPT in zero-shot evaluation. Second, we implement a modular multi-agent pipeline in which a Clinical Reasoning agent (fine-tuned LLaMA) produces structured explanations, an Evidence Retrieval agent queries PubMed to ground responses in recent literature, and a Refinement agent (DeepSeek R1) improves clarity and factual consistency; an optional human validation path is triggered for high-risk or high-uncertainty cases. Safety mechanisms include Monte Carlo dropout and perplexity-based uncertainty scoring, plus lexical and sentiment-based bias detection supported by LIME/SHAP-based analyses. In evaluation, the full system achieves 87% accuracy with relevance around 0.80, and evidence augmentation reduces uncertainty (perplexity 4.13) compared to base responses, with mean end-to-end latency of 36.5 seconds under the reported configuration. Overall, the results indicate that agent specialisation and verification layers can mitigate key single-model limitations and provide a practical, extensible design for evidence-based and bias-aware medical AI."}

Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates.

We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches."}

Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval. Our work proposes a general framework for ST-guided finetuning of pathology foundation models, showing that augmenting existing models with localized molecular supervision is an effective and practical step for improving visual representations and expanding their cross-modal utility."}

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

This paper evaluates the performance of four state-of-the-art models (Grok-4, GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, and GPT-5) on long short-context tasks. For this purpose, three datasets were used: two supplementary datasets for retrieving culinary recipes and math problems, and a primary dataset of 20K social media posts for depression detection. The results show that as the input volume on the social media dataset exceeds 5K posts (70K tokens), the performance of all models degrades significantly, with accuracy dropping to around 50-53% for 20K posts. Notably, in the GPT-5 model, despite the sharp decline in accuracy, its precision remained high at approximately 95%, a feature that could be highly effective for sensitive applications like depression detection. This research also indicates that the \"lost in the middle\" problem has been largely resolved in newer models.

Classical machine-learning methods can struggle under these conditions, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \\textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation."}

We evaluate this framework across two complementary scientific benchmarks: SciFact and PubMedQA, covering both closed-book and open-domain evidence settings. Experiments are conducted with six diverse language models, including encoder-decoder, open-weight chat models, and proprietary APIs. Across all benchmarks and models, we observe that raw accuracy varies only modestly across architectures, while abstention plays a critical role in controlling error. In particular, confidence-based abstention substantially reduces risk at moderate coverage levels, even when absolute accuracy improvements are limited. Our results suggest that in scientific reasoning tasks, the primary challenge is not selecting a single best model, but rather determining when available evidence is sufficient to justify an answer.

The model learns a joint distribution over microstructures and PDE solutions, supporting bidirectional inference (forward prediction and inverse recovery) within a single architecture. The generative formulation enables training with unlabeled data, physics residuals, and minimal labeled pairs. A physics-aware decoder incorporating a differentiable coarse-grained PDE solver preserves governing equation structure, enabling extrapolation to varying boundary conditions and microstructural statistics. A learnable normalizing flow prior captures complex posterior structure for inverse problems.

As a result, effective and fast methods to develop evacuation plans are of great importance. In this work, we identify and propose the Bus Evacuation Orienteering Problem (BEOP), an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with the goal of evacuating as many people from an affected area by bus in a short, predefined amount of time. The purpose of bus-based evacuation is to reduce congestion and disorder that arises in purely car-focused evacuation scenarios. To solve the BEOP, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based method utilizing graph learning, which, once trained, achieves fast inference speed and is able to create evacuation routes in fractions of seconds. We can bound the gap of our evacuation plans using an MILP formulation. To validate our method, we create evacuation scenarios for San Francisco using real-world road networks and travel times. We show that we achieve near-optimal solution quality and are further able to investigate how many evacuation vehicles are necessary to achieve certain bus-based evacuation quotas given a predefined evacuation time while keeping run time adequate."}

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings."}

We examined their potential to assess parental cooperation during CPS interventions using case reports, a case factor characterized by ambiguous and conflicting information. Methods: A four stage workflow comprising (1) case reports collection, (2) reasoning-based assessment of parental cooperation, (3) automated category extraction, and (4) case labeling was developed. The performance of RLMs with different parameter sizes (255B, 32B, 4B) was compared against human validated data.

Classification accuracy was higher for mothers (93%) than for fathers (85%), and EHRs exhibited similar differences. Conclusions: RLMs' reasoning can effectively assess complex case factors such as parental cooperation. Lower accuracy in assessing fathers' cooperation supports the argument of a stronger professional focus on mothers in CPS interventions."}

While closed-source models typically rely on external defenses, open-weight models must primarily depend on internal safeguards to mitigate harmful behavior. Prior red-teaming research has largely focused on input-based jailbreaking and parameter-level manipulations. However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins. Despite its potential, this attack vector has received little systematic attention. We present the largest empirical study to date of prefill attacks, evaluating over 20 existing and novel strategies across multiple model families and state-of-the-art open-weight models. Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment. While certain large reasoning models exhibit some robustness against generic prefilling, they remain vulnerable to tailored, model-specific strategies. Our findings underscore the urgent need for model developers to prioritize defenses against prefill attacks in open-weight LLMs."}

Large language models (LLMs) today primarily self-improve via two mechanisms: self-reflection for context updates, and reinforcement learning (RL) for weight updates. In this work, we propose Evolutionary System Prompt Learning (E-SPL), a method for jointly improving model contexts and model weights. In each RL iteration, E-SPL selects multiple system prompts and runs rollouts with each in parallel. It applies RL updates to model weights conditioned on each system prompt, and evolutionary updates to the system prompt population via LLM-driven mutation and crossover. Each system prompt has a TrueSkill rating for evolutionary selection, updated from relative performance within each RL iteration batch. E-SPL encourages a natural division between declarative knowledge encoded in prompts and procedural knowledge encoded in weights, resulting in improved performance across reasoning and agentic tasks. For instance, in an easy-to-hard (AIME $\\rightarrow$ BeyondAIME) generalization setting, E-SPL improves RL success rate from 38.8% $\\rightarrow$ 45.1% while also outperforming reflective prompt evolution (40.0%). Overall, our results show that coupling reinforcement learning with system prompt evolution yields consistent gains in sample efficiency and generalization.

The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels.

Each agent is a machine learning (ML)-based detector that produces a normalized anomaly score, confidence, and structured evidence, augmented by a large language model (LLM)-based critic. A coordinator converts these messages into bounded per-agent losses and updates agent influence via an exponentiated-gradient rule, yielding both a final debated anomaly score and an auditable debate trace. MAD is a unified agentic framework that can recover existing approaches, such as mixture-of-experts gating and learning-with-expert-advice aggregation, by restricting the message space and synthesis operator.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions.

Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste.

By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale."}

The challenge arises due to the limited availability of a MOS-labeled training dataset comprising multi-rate speech samples. While self-supervised learning (SSL) models have been widely adopted in SQA to boost performance, a key limitation is that they are pretrained on 16 kHz speech and therefore discard high-frequency information present in higher sampling rates. To address this issue, we propose a spectrogram-augmented SSL method that incorporates high-frequency features (up to 48 kHz sampling rate) through a parallel-branch architecture. We further introduce a two-step training scheme: the model is first pre-trained on a large 48 kHz dataset and then fine-tuned on a smaller multi-rate dataset. Experimental results show that leveraging high-frequency information overlooked by SSL features is crucial for accurate multi-rate SQA, and that the proposed two-step training substantially improves generalization when multi-rate data is limited."}

We provide a rational analysis of this phenomenon, showing that when a Bayesian agent is provided with data that are sampled based on a current hypothesis the agent becomes increasingly confident about that hypothesis but does not make any progress towards the truth. We test this prediction using a modified Wason 2-4-6 rule discovery task where participants (N=557) interacted with AI agents providing different types of feedback.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by comparing causal estimates derived from unstructured text against those obtained from structured data across population, group, and individual levels. Our findings show consistent results between the two approaches, validating the potential of unstructured text in causal inference tasks. Our approach extends the applicability of causal inference methods to scenarios where only textual data is available, enabling data-driven business decision-making when structured tabular data is scarce."}

Yet, protein bioengineering poses unique challenges for sequence representation, as experimental datasets typically feature few mutations, which are either sparsely distributed across the entire sequence or densely concentrated within localized regions. This limits the ability of sequence-level representations to extract functionally meaningful signals. In addition, comprehensive comparative studies remain scarce, despite their crucial role in clarifying which representations best encode relevant information and ultimately support superior predictive performance. In this study, we systematically evaluate multiple ProtBERT and ESM2 embedding variants as sequence representations, using the adeno-associated virus capsid as a case study and prototypical example of bioengineering, where functional optimization is targeted through highly localized sequence variation within an otherwise large protein. Our results reveal that, prior to fine-tuning, amino acid-level embeddings outperform sequence-level representations in supervised predictive tasks, whereas the latter tend to be more effective in unsupervised settings. However, optimal performance is only achieved when embeddings are fine-tuned with task-specific labels, with sequence-level representations providing the best performance. Moreover, our findings indicate that the extent of sequence variation required to produce notable shifts in sequence representations exceeds what is typically explored in bioengineering studies, showing the need for fine-tuning in datasets characterized by sparse or highly localized mutations."}

Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail."}

To address this gap, we study adaptive group elicitation, a multi-round setting where an agent adaptively selects both questions and respondents under explicit query and participation budgets. We propose a theoretically grounded framework that combines (i) an LLM-based expected information gain objective for scoring candidate questions with (ii) heterogeneous graph neural network propagation that aggregates observed responses and participant attributes to impute missing responses and guide per-round respondent selection. This closed-loop procedure queries a small, informative subset of individuals while inferring population-level responses via structured similarity.

At a given dimension, image samples are regarded as simplicial complexes, and persistent sheaf Laplacians are utilized to extract a multiscale localized topological spectral representation for individual image samples. Statistical summaries of the resulting spectra are then aggregated across scales and dimensions to form multiscale multi-dimensional image representations. We evaluate the proposed framework on the COIL20 and ETH80 image datasets using standard classification protocols. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides more stable performance across a wide range of reduced dimensions and achieves consistent improvements to PCA-based baselines in moderate dimensional regimes."}

While reviewers routinely evaluate figures, tables, and complex layouts to assess scientific claims, most existing datasets remain overwhelmingly text-centric.

It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model."}

The optimization method coincides conceptually with the online Machine Learning (ML) methods, making it computationally very efficient. Such an approach allows a straightforward application of standard software packages for molecular dynamics (MD), supplemented by the ML-based optimizer. The new method is applied to model systems with a simple, pairwise Lennard-Jones potential, as well with multi-body Tersoff potential, describing covalent bonds. Using LAMMPS software we simulate collision of particles of different size. Comparing simulation results, obtained by the novel method, with full-atomic simulations, we demonstrate its accuracy, validity and overwhelming superiority in computational speed. Furthermore, we compare our method with other hybrid methods, specifically, with the closest one -- AtC (Atomic to Continuum) method.

Here we introduce a general framework, which we term drift-diffusion matching, for training continuous-time RNNs to represent arbitrary stochastic dynamical systems within a low-dimensional latent subspace. Allowing asymmetric connectivity, we show that RNNs can faithfully embed the drift and diffusion of a given stochastic differential equation, including nonlinear and nonequilibrium dynamics such as chaotic attractors. As an application, we construct RNN realisations of stochastic systems that transiently explore various attractors through both input-driven switching and autonomous transitions driven by nonequilibrium currents, which we interpret as models of associative and sequential (episodic) memory. To elucidate how these dynamics are encoded in the network, we introduce decompositions of the RNN based on its asymmetric connectivity and its time-irreversibility. Our results extend attractor neural network theory beyond equilibrium, showing that asymmetric neural populations can implement a broad class of dynamical computations within low-dimensional manifolds, unifying ideas from associative memory, nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, and neural computation."}

Lately, Moltbook approximates a plausible future scenario in which autonomous agents participate in an open-ended, continuously evolving online society. We present the first large-scale systemic diagnosis of this AI agent society. Beyond static observation, we introduce a quantitative diagnostic framework for dynamic evolution in AI agent societies, measuring semantic stabilization, lexical turnover, individual inertia, influence persistence, and collective consensus. Our analysis reveals a system in dynamic balance in Moltbook: while global semantic averages stabilize rapidly, individual agents retain high diversity and persistent lexical turnover, defying homogenization. However, agents exhibit strong individual inertia and minimal adaptive response to interaction partners, preventing mutual influence and consensus. Consequently, influence remains transient with no persistent supernodes, and the society fails to develop stable collective influence anchors due to the absence of shared social memory. These findings demonstrate that scale and interaction density alone are insufficient to induce socialization, providing actionable design and analysis principles for upcoming next-generation AI agent societies."}

They arise from the need for transient simulations extending over long periods of time with small time steps and from the reverse temporal propagation of the primal and adjoint solutions. These challenges place considerable demands on the required storage and computing power, which significantly hamper the use of adjoint methods in the industry. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted optimization framework that employs a Conditional Variational Autoencoder-based surrogate model of the propulsion system. The surrogate model replicates the time-averaged flow field induced by a Voith Schneider Propeller and replaces the geometrically and time-resolved propeller with a data-driven approximation. Primal flow verification examples demonstrate that the surrogate model achieves significant computational savings while maintaining the necessary accuracy of the resolved propeller. Optimization studies show that ignoring the propulsion system can yield designs that perform worse than the initial shape. In contrast, the proposed method produces shapes that achieve more than an 8\\% reduction in resistance."}

Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training.

In this paper, we thus present a new model of coalition formation with possibly overlapping coalitions under partial information, where selfish agents may be part of multiple coalitions simultaneously and their full preferences are initially unknown. Instead, information about past interactions and associated utility feedback is stored in a fixed offline dataset, and we aim to efficiently infer the agents' preferences from this dataset. We analyze the impact of diverse dataset information constraints by studying two types of utility feedback that can be stored in the dataset: agent- and coalition-level utility feedback. For both feedback models, we identify assumptions under which the dataset covers sufficient information for an offline learning algorithm to infer preferences and use them to recover a partition that is (approximately) Nash stable, in which no agent can improve her utility by unilaterally deviating. Our additional goal is devising algorithms with low sample complexity, requiring only a small dataset to obtain a desired approximation to Nash stability. Under agent-level feedback, we provide a sample-efficient algorithm proven to obtain an approximately Nash stable partition under a sufficient and necessary assumption on the information covered by the dataset. However, under coalition-level feedback, we show that only under a stricter assumption is sufficient for sample-efficient learning. Still, in multiple cases, our algorithms' sample complexity bounds have optimality guarantees up to logarithmic factors. Finally, extensive experiments show that our algorithm converges to a low approximation level to Nash stability across diverse settings."}

Protective systems are tasked with the detection, classification, and localization of faulty voltage and current line magnitudes, culminating in the activation of circuit breakers to isolate the faulty line. An essential aspect of designing effective fault detection systems lies in obtaining reliable data for training and testing, which is often scarce. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the powerful capabilities of pattern classifiers in learning, generalizing, and parallel processing, offers promising avenues for intelligent fault detection. To address this, our paper proposes an anomaly-based approach for fault detection in electrical power systems, employing deep autoencoders. Additionally, we utilize Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE) for dimensionality reduction, which, due to its fewer parameters, requires less training time compared to conventional autoencoders. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and accuracy compared to alternative detection approaches by achieving an accuracy of 97.62% and 99.92% on simulated and publicly available datasets."}

In this setting, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently been adopted as a powerful framework for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks. While existing approaches successfully train generalist policies, they often struggle to effectively capture the rich logical and temporal structure inherent in LTL specifications. In this work, we address these concerns with a novel approach to learn structured task representations that facilitate training and generalisation. Our method conditions the policy on sequences of Boolean formulae constructed from a finite automaton of the task. We propose a hierarchical neural architecture to encode the logical structure of these formulae, and introduce an attention mechanism that enables the policy to reason about future subgoals. Experiments in a variety of complex environments demonstrate the strong generalisation capabilities and superior performance of our approach."}

We introduce an architecture that incorporates gradient networks directly into the fundamental machine equations, enabling accurate modeling of the nonlinear and coupled electromagnetic constitutive relationship. By learning the gradient of the magnetic field energy, the model inherently satisfies energy balance (reciprocity conditions). The proposed architecture can universally approximate any physically feasible magnetic behavior and offers several advantages over lookup tables and standard machine learning models: it requires less training data, ensures monotonicity and reliable extrapolation, and produces smooth outputs. These properties further enable robust model inversion and optimal trajectory generation, often needed in control applications. We validate the proposed approach using measured and finite-element method (FEM) datasets from a 5.6-kW permanent-magnet (PM) synchronous reluctance machine.

Automated exploitation systems can help validate these reports; however, existing approaches typically operate in isolation from detection pipelines, failing to leverage readily available metadata such as vulnerability type and source-code location. In this paper, we investigate how reported security vulnerabilities can be assessed in a realistic grey-box exploitation setting that leverages minimal vulnerability metadata, specifically a CWE classification and a vulnerable code location. We introduce Agentic eXploit Engine (AXE), a multi-agent framework for Web application exploitation that maps lightweight detection metadata to concrete exploits through decoupled planning, code exploration, and dynamic execution feedback. Evaluated on the CVE-Bench dataset, AXE achieves a 30% exploitation success rate, a 3x improvement over state-of-the-art black-box baselines. Even in a single-agent configuration, grey-box metadata yields a 1.75x performance gain. Systematic error analysis shows that most failed attempts arise from specific reasoning gaps, including misinterpreted vulnerability semantics and unmet execution preconditions. For successful exploits, AXE produces actionable, reproducible proof-of-concept artifacts, demonstrating its utility in streamlining Web vulnerability triage and remediation. We further evaluate AXE's generalizability through a case study on a recent real-world vulnerability not included in CVE-Bench."}

Phys. Chem. Lett., 2026, 17, 5, 1288-1295), we propose the DMTS-NC approach, a distilled multi-time-step (DMTS) strategy using non conservative (NC) forces to further accelerate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using foundation neural network models. There, a dual-level reversible reference system propagator algorithm (RESPA) formalism couples a target accurate conservative potential to a simplified distilled representation optimized for the production of non-conservative forces. Despite being non-conservative, the distilled architecture is designed to enforce key physical priors, such as equivariance under rotation and cancellation of atomic force components. These choices facilitate the distillation process and therefore improve drastically the robustness of simulation, significantly limiting the \"holes\" in the simpler potential, thus achieving excellent agreement with the forces data. Overall, the DMTS-NC scheme is found to be more stable and efficient than its conservative counterpart with additional speedups reaching 15-30% over DMTS. Requiring no finetuning steps, it is easier to implement and can be pushed to the limit of the systems physical resonances to maintain accuracy while providing maximum efficiency. As for DMTS, DMTS-NC is applicable to any neural network potential."}

During training, WIMLE weights each synthetic transition by its predicted confidence, preserving useful model rollouts while attenuating bias from uncertain predictions and enabling stable learning. Across $40$ continuous-control tasks spanning DeepMind Control, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench, WIMLE achieves superior sample efficiency and competitive or better asymptotic performance than strong model-free and model-based baselines. Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2).

Thermal sensing plays a critical role in settings where visible light fails, including nighttime surveillance, search and rescue, autonomous driving, and medical screening. Unlike RGB imagery, thermal images encode physical temperature rather than color or texture, requiring perceptual and reasoning capabilities that existing RGB-centric benchmarks do not evaluate. We introduce ThermEval-B, a structured benchmark of approximately 55,000 thermal visual question answering pairs designed to assess the foundational primitives required for thermal vision language understanding. ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments. Evaluating 25 open-source and closed-source VLMs, we find that models consistently fail at temperature-grounded reasoning, degrade under colormap transformations, and default to language priors or fixed responses, with only marginal gains from prompting or supervised fine-tuning. These results demonstrate that thermal understanding requires dedicated evaluation beyond RGB-centric assumptions, positioning ThermEval as a benchmark to drive progress in thermal vision language modeling."}

The researcher observed design and evaluation activities and conducted interviews with both developers and domain experts. Analysis revealed four key practices: creating workarounds for data collection, turning to augmentation when expert input was limited, co-developing evaluation criteria with experts, and adopting hybrid expert-developer-LLM evaluation strategies. These practices show how teams made strategic decisions under constraints and demonstrate the central role of domain expertise in shaping the system. Challenges included expert motivation and trust, difficulties structuring participatory design, and questions around ownership and integration of expert knowledge. We propose design opportunities for future LLM development workflows that emphasize AI literacy, transparent consent, and frameworks recognizing evolving expert roles."}

In this paper, we propose a Distributed Quantum Gaussian Process (DQGP) method in a multiagent setting to enhance modeling capabilities and scalability. To address the challenging non-Euclidean optimization problem, we develop a Distributed consensus Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DR-ADMM) algorithm that aggregates local agent models into a global model.

For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: policies latch onto incidental features of training histories that do not generalize to out-of-distribution trajectories upon deployment. We analyze why policies latch onto these spurious correlations and find that this problem stems from limited coverage over the space of possible histories during training, which grows exponentially with horizon. Existing regularization techniques provide inconsistent benefits across tasks, as they do not fundamentally address this coverage problem. Motivated by these findings, we propose Big Picture Policies (BPP), an approach that conditions on a minimal set of meaningful keyframes detected by a vision-language model. By projecting diverse rollouts onto a compact set of task-relevant events, BPP substantially reduces distribution shift between training and deployment, without sacrificing expressivity. We evaluate BPP on four challenging real-world manipulation tasks and three simulation tasks, all requiring history conditioning. BPP achieves 70% higher success rates than the best comparison on real-world evaluations."}

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

Early diagnosis and tight follow-up are essential to the management of RA, as ongoing inflammation can cause irreversible joint damage. The detection of arthritis is important for diagnosis and assessment of disease activity; however, it often takes a long time for patients to receive appropriate specialist care. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images. This task is highly challenging due to general issues in medical imaging, such as the scarcity of positive samples, data imbalance, and the inherent difficulty of the task itself. However, to the best of our knowledge, no existing work has explicitly addressed these challenges in RGB-based RA inflammation detection. This paper quantitatively demonstrates the difficulty of visually detecting inflammation by constructing a dedicated dataset, and we propose a inflammation detection framework with global local encoder that combines self-supervised pretraining on large-scale healthy hand images with imbalance-aware training to detect RA-related joint inflammation from RGB hand images. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed approach improves F1-score by 0.2 points and Gmean by 0.25 points compared with the baseline model."}

We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration."}

However, when the database contains sensitive corpora, such as medical records or legal documents, RAG poses serious privacy risks by potentially exposing private information through its outputs. Prior work has demonstrated that one can practically craft adversarial prompts that force an LLM to regurgitate the augmented contexts. A promising direction is to integrate differential privacy (DP), a privacy notion that offers strong formal guarantees, into RAG systems. However, naively applying DP mechanisms into existing systems often leads to significant utility degradation. Particularly for RAG systems, DP can reduce the usefulness of the augmented contexts leading to increase risk of hallucination from the LLMs. Motivated by these challenges, we present DP-KSA, a novel privacy-preserving RAG algorithm that integrates DP using the propose-test-release paradigm. DP-KSA follows from a key observation that most question-answering (QA) queries can be sufficiently answered with a few keywords. Hence, DP-KSA first obtains an ensemble of relevant contexts, each of which will be used to generate a response from an LLM. We utilize these responses to obtain the most frequent keywords in a differentially private manner. Lastly, the keywords are augmented into the prompt for the final output. This approach effectively compresses the semantic space while preserving both utility and privacy. We formally show that DP-KSA provides formal DP guarantees on the generated output with respect to the RAG database. We evaluate DP-KSA on two QA benchmarks using three instruction-tuned LLMs, and our empirical results demonstrate that DP-KSA achieves a strong privacy-utility tradeoff."}

This paper proposes pFedNavi, a structure-aware and dynamically adaptive personalized federated learning framework tailored for VLN. Our key idea is to personalize where it matters: pFedNavi adaptively identifies client-specific layers via layer-wise mixing coefficients, and performs fine-grained parameter fusion on the selected components (e.g., the encoder-decoder projection and environment-sensitive decoder layers) to balance global knowledge sharing with local specialization. We evaluate pFedNavi on two standard VLN benchmarks, R2R and RxR, using both ResNet and CLIP visual representations. Across all metrics, pFedNavi consistently outperforms the FedAvg-based VLN baseline, achieving up to 7.5% improvement in navigation success rate and up to 7.8% gain in trajectory fidelity, while converging 1.38x faster under non-IID conditions."}

Moreover, these methods rely on devices, such as hyperspectral cameras and mass spectrometers, increasing detection costs and prolonging data acquisition time. To address these issues, we propose a feature recalibration based olfactory-visual multimodal model for fine-grained rice deterioration detection. The fine-grained deterioration embedding constructor (FDEC) is proposed to reconstruct the labeled multimodal embedded-feature dataset, enhancing sample representation. The fine-grained deterioration recalibration attention network (FDRA-Net) is proposed to emphasize signal variations and increase sensitivity to fine-grained deterioration on the rice surface. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.89%. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the detection accuracy is improved and the procedure is simplified. Furthermore, field detection demonstrates the advantages of accuracy and operational simplicity. The proposed method can also be extended to other agrifood in agriculture and food industry."}

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap."}

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency."}

We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block. Analysis of the synchronization matrices reveals non-uniform, head-diverse coupling patterns even at initialization, demonstrating a stronger architectural inductive bias than the approximately uniform attention produced by randomly initialized Transformers."}

Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models. Notably, at 50% sparsity, WiSparse preserves 97% of Llama3.1's dense performance, surpassing the strongest baseline by 2.23 percentage points while achieving a 21.4% acceleration in end-to-end inference speed.

This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \\emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \\texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \\texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves. These findings demonstrate that the proposed indicators provide actionable visibility into hidden instability modes in large-scale DP fine-tuning, enabling more reliable diagnosis and configuration assessment."}

We identify that correspondence cues within generative diffusion models are under-explored and that content consistency across semantically matched regions is often neglected. CoCoDiff introduces a pixel-wise semantic correspondence module that mines intermediate diffusion features to construct a dense alignment map between content and style images. Furthermore, a cycle-consistency module then enforces structural and perceptual alignment across iterations, yielding object and region level stylization that preserves geometry and detail. Despite requiring no additional training or supervision, CoCoDiff delivers state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative results, outperforming methods that rely on extra training or annotations."}

Analyzing 28,683 posts (after filtering automated spam) and 138 comment threads with statistical and qualitative methods, we find evidence of genuine peer learning behaviors: agents teach skills they built (74K comments on a skill tutorial), report discoveries, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Qualitative comment analysis reveals a taxonomy of peer response patterns: validation (22%), knowledge extension (18%), application (12%), and metacognitive reflection (7%), with agents building on each others' frameworks across multiple languages. We characterize how AI peer learning differs from human peer learning: (1) teaching (statements) dramatically outperforms help-seeking (questions) with an 11.4:1 ratio; (2) learning-oriented content (procedural and conceptual) receives 3x more engagement than other content; (3) extreme participation inequality reveals non-human behavioral signatures.

One of the key challenges is to effectively represent and extract the semantic meaning of any given source signals. While deep learning (DL)-based solutions have shown promising results in extracting implicit semantic information from a wide range of sources, existing work often overlooks the high computational complexity inherent in both model training and inference for the DL-based encoder and decoder. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) framework which extends the classical rate-distortion theory by incorporating the constraints on semantic distance, including both the traditional bit-wise distortion metric and statistical difference-based divergence metric, and complexity measure, adopted from the theory of minimum description length and information bottleneck. We derive the closed-form theoretical results of the minimum achievable rate under given constraints on semantic distance and complexity for both Gaussian and binary semantic sources. Our theoretical results show a fundamental three-way tradeoff among achievable rate, semantic distance, and model complexity. Extensive experiments on real-world image and video datasets validate this tradeoff and further demonstrate that our information-theoretic complexity measure effectively correlates with practical computational costs, guiding efficient system design in resource-constrained scenarios."}

TikArt follows a Think-Aperture-Observe loop, alternating between language generation and two aperture actions: Zoom extracts rectangular crops, while Segment invokes SAM2 to obtain mask-based crops for irregular targets. After every action, the model must produce an explicit observation, turning local visual cues into persistent linguistic memory.

In this paper, we propose XTF, an explainable token-level noise filtering framework. XTF decomposes the complex and subtle contributions of token-level data to the fine-tuning process into three distinct and explicit attributes (reasoning importance, knowledge novelty, and task relevance), which can be assessed using scoring methods, and then masks the gradients of selected noisy tokens accordingly to optimize the performance of fine-tuned LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative downstream tasks (math, code and medicine) across 7 mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that XTF can significantly improve downstream performance by up to 13.7% compared to regular fine-tuning.

In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing."}

However, in the real world, the number of agents is neither fixed nor known a priori. Moreover, an agent can decide to create other agents (for example, a cell may divide, or a company may spin off a division). In this paper, we propose a framework that allows agents to create other agents; we call this a fluid-agent environment. We present game-theoretic solution concepts for fluid-agent games and empirically evaluate the performance of several MARL algorithms within this framework. Our experiments include fluid variants of established benchmarks such as Predator-Prey and Level-Based Foraging, where agents can dynamically spawn, as well as a new environment we introduce that highlights how fluidity can unlock novel solution strategies beyond those observed in fixed-population settings.

Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method."}

Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05."}

To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

Existing safety approaches emphasize alignment, interpretability, or action-level filtering. We argue that these mechanisms are necessary but insufficient because they do not directly govern selection power: the authority to determine which options are generated, surfaced, and framed for decision. We propose a governance architecture that separates cognition, selection, and action into distinct domains and models autonomy as a vector of sovereignty. Cognitive autonomy remains unconstrained, while selection and action autonomy are bounded through mechanically enforced primitives operating outside the agent's optimization space. The architecture integrates external candidate generation (CEFL), a governed reducer, commit-reveal entropy isolation, rationale validation, and fail-loud circuit breakers. We evaluate the system across multiple regulated financial scenarios under adversarial stress targeting variance manipulation, threshold gaming, framing skew, ordering effects, and entropy probing. Metrics quantify selection concentration, narrative diversity, governance activation cost, and failure visibility. Results show that mechanical selection governance is implementable, auditable, and prevents deterministic outcome capture while preserving reasoning capacity. Although probabilistic concentration remains, the architecture measurably bounds selection authority relative to conventional scalar pipelines. This work reframes governance as bounded causal power rather than internal intent alignment, offering a foundation for deploying autonomous agents where silent failure is unacceptable."}

Existing audio-language models show promise, but long-audio question answering remains difficult due to context-length limits. We introduce LongAudio-RAG (LA-RAG), a hybrid framework that grounds Large Language Model (LLM) outputs in retrieved, timestamped acoustic event detections rather than raw audio. Multi-hour streams are converted into structured event records stored in an SQL database, and at inference time the system resolves natural-language time references, classifies intent, retrieves only the relevant events, and generates answers using this constrained evidence. To evaluate performance, we construct a synthetic long-audio benchmark by concatenating recordings with preserved timestamps and generating template-based question-answer pairs for detection, counting, and summarization tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach by deploying it in a hybrid edge-cloud environment, where the audio grounding model runs on-device on IoT-class hardware while the LLM is hosted on a GPU-backed server. This architecture enables low-latency event extraction at the edge and high-quality language reasoning in the cloud. Experiments show that structured, event-level retrieval significantly improves accuracy compared to vanilla Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or text-to-SQL approaches."}

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

Current self-evolving MAS mainly focus on Spatial Evolving or Temporal Evolving paradigm, which only considers the single dimension of evolution and does not fully incentivize LLMs' collaborative capability. In this work, we start from a novel Spatio-Temporal perspective by proposing ST-EVO, which supports dialogue-wise communication scheduling with a compact yet powerful flow-matching based Scheduler. To make precise Spatio-Temporal scheduling, ST-EVO can also perceive the uncertainty of MAS, and possesses self-feedback ability to learn from accumulated experience.

Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results."}

However, open-weight models also natively support prefilling, which allows an attacker to predefine initial response tokens before generation begins.

Our results show that prefill attacks are consistently effective against all major contemporary open-weight models, revealing a critical and previously underexplored vulnerability with significant implications for deployment.

Experimental results demonstrate that our framework substantially improves maneuverability and success rates, achieving more than a 40% gain over DRL baselines.

These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models."}

In this work, we empirically localize this input-output alignment shift in pretrained LLMs, using decoding trajectories over tied embedding spaces and similarity-based metrics. Our experiments reveal that the hidden token representations switch from input alignment to output alignment deep within the network. Motivated by this observation, we propose a lightweight residual-path mitigation based on residual attenuation, implemented either as a fixed-layer intervention or as a learnable gating mechanism.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness."}

Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks."}

Task-driven hard-attention models for vision are often evaluated by how well their scanpaths match human gaze. However, common scanpath metrics can be strongly confounded by dataset-specific center bias, especially on object-centric datasets. Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large. We discuss implications for evaluating active perception on object-centric datasets and for designing gaze benchmarks that better separate behavioral alignment from center bias."}

It is mostly used in two contexts: improving the calibration of classifiers and tuning the stochasticity of large language models (LLMs). In both cases, temperature scaling is the most popular method for the job. Despite its popularity, a rigorous theoretical analysis of the properties of temperature scaling has remained elusive. We investigate here some of these properties. For classification, we show that increasing the temperature increases the uncertainty in the model in a very general sense (and in particular increases its entropy). However, for LLMs, we challenge the common claim that increasing temperature increases diversity. Furthermore, we introduce two new characterisations of temperature scaling. The first one is geometric: the tempered model is shown to be the information projection of the original model onto the set of models with a given entropy. The second characterisation clarifies the role of temperature scaling as a submodel of more general linear scalers such as matrix scaling and Dirichlet calibration: we show that temperature scaling is the only linear scaler that does not change the hard predictions of the model."}

To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities.

Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments."}

As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss.

However, their performance often degrades on heterophilic hypergraphs, where nodes connected by the same hyperedge tend to have dissimilar semantic representations or belong to different classes. While several HyGNNs, including our prior work BHyGNN, have been proposed to address heterophily, their reliance on labeled data significantly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs.

Existing memory-based approaches often condition generation on globally reconstructed 3D scenes by rendering anchor videos from the reconstructed geometry in the history. However, reconstructing a global 3D scene from multiple views inevitably introduces cross-view misalignment, as pose and depth estimation errors cause the same surfaces to be reconstructed at slightly different 3D locations across views. When fused, these inconsistencies accumulate into noisy geometry that contaminates the conditioning signals and degrades generation quality. We introduce AnchorWeave, a memory-augmented video generation framework that replaces a single misaligned global memory with multiple clean local geometric memories and learns to reconcile their cross-view inconsistencies. To this end, AnchorWeave performs coverage-driven local memory retrieval aligned with the target trajectory and integrates the selected local memories through a multi-anchor weaving controller during generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorWeave significantly improves long-term scene consistency while maintaining strong visual quality, with ablation and analysis studies further validating the effectiveness of local geometric conditioning, multi-anchor control, and coverage-driven retrieval."}

While prior work has primarily focused on 3D asset placement, it often overlooks the physical relationships between objects (e.g., contact, support, balance, and containment), which are essential for creating complex and realistic manipulation scenarios such as tabletop arrangements, shelf organization, or box packing. Compared to classical 3D layout generation, producing complex physical scenes introduces additional challenges: (a) higher object density and complexity (e.g., a small shelf may hold dozens of books), (b) richer supporting relationships and compact spatial layouts, and (c) the need to accurately model both spatial placement and physical properties. To address these challenges, we propose PhyScensis, an LLM agent-based framework powered by a physics engine, to produce physically plausible scene configurations with high complexity. Specifically, our framework consists of three main components: an LLM agent iteratively proposes assets with spatial and physical predicates; a solver, equipped with a physics engine, realizes these predicates into a 3D scene; and feedback from the solver informs the agent to refine and enrich the configuration. Moreover, our framework preserves strong controllability over fine-grained textual descriptions and numerical parameters (e.g., relative positions, scene stability), enabled through probabilistic programming for stability and a complementary heuristic that jointly regulates stability and spatial relations. Experimental results show that our method outperforms prior approaches in scene complexity, visual quality, and physical accuracy, offering a unified pipeline for generating complex physical scene layouts for robotic manipulation."}

ThermEval-B integrates public datasets with our newly collected ThermEval-D, the first dataset to provide dense per-pixel temperature maps with semantic body-part annotations across diverse indoor and outdoor environments.

The core challenge is a routing problem: each task admits dozens of preference dimensions, yet individual users care about only a few, and which ones matter depends on who is asking. With a limited question budget, asking without structure will miss the dimensions that matter. Reinforcement learning is the natural formulation, but in multi-turn settings its terminal reward fails to exploit the factored, per-criterion structure of preference data, and in practice learned policies collapse to static question sequences that ignore user responses. We propose decomposing cold-start elicitation into offline structure learning and online Bayesian inference. Pep (Preference Elicitation with Priors) learns a structured world model of preference correlations offline from complete profiles, then performs training-free Bayesian inference online to select informative questions and predict complete preference profiles, including dimensions never asked about. The framework is modular across downstream solvers and requires only simple belief models. Across medical, mathematical, social, and commonsense reasoning, Pep achieves 80.8% alignment between generated responses and users' stated preferences versus 68.5% for RL, with 3-5x fewer interactions. When two users give different answers to the same question, Pep changes its follow-up 39-62% of the time versus 0-28% for RL. It does so with ~10K parameters versus 8B for RL, showing that the bottleneck in cold-start elicitation is the capability to exploit the factored structure of preference data."}

A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation. Moreover, with a novel architecture Canon, CanonFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging GEOM-DRUG dataset, and the advantage remains large in few-step generation."}

We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/SafeRL-Lab/PAPerBench"}

TL;DR: 链式机器人案例（Chain-of-Agents）通过多机器人萌菌和机器人强化学习技术，在单个模型内实现精复杂问题求解，达到了多份语言模型系统的新性能标杆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多机器人系统依靠手动提示工程设计，计算效率低且无法从数据中学习，需要一种能在单个模型内实现精复杂问题求解的本地化方案。

Method: 提出链式机器人案例（CoA）概念，通过多机器人萌菌技术将最优多机器人系统转换为训练数据，然后使用机器人强化学习在可验证任务上进一步提升模型能力。

Result: 机器人基础模型（AFMs）在web机器人和代码机器人多个测试集上创造了新的性能记录，达到了独树一帝的表现。

Conclusion: 该研究为机器人模型和机器人强化学习领域提供了坚实的开始点，所有研究成果包括模型权重、代码和训练数据均已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

### [2] [Cognitive Workspace: Active Memory Management for LLMs -- An Empirical Study of Functional Infinite Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13171)
*Tao An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Cognitive Workspace新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆使用机制，超越传统RAG方法，实现主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在上下文管理方面的根本限制，尽管上下文窗口已扩展到百万token，但现有检索系统缺乏人类记忆管理的动态性和任务驱动特性

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），采用三个核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲器、任务驱动的上下文优化

Result: 平均58.6%的记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著（p < 0.001, Cohen's d > 23）

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统中的主动记忆优势提供了首个定量证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

### [3] [AlphaEval: A Comprehensive and Efficient Evaluation Framework for Formula Alpha Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13174)
*Hongjun Ding,Binqi Chen,Jinsheng Huang,Taian Guo,Zhengyang Mao,Guoyi Shao,Lutong Zou,Luchen Liu,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AlphaEval是一个统一的、可并行化的、无需回测的自动化alpha挖掘模型评估框架，从五个维度全面评估alpha质量，比传统方法更高效全面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在局限：回测计算密集且参数敏感，相关性指标只关注预测能力而忽略其他重要属性，且大多数模型闭源阻碍了可复现性。

Method: 提出AlphaEval框架，从预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动鲁棒性、金融逻辑性和多样性五个互补维度评估alpha质量，无需进行回测。

Result: 实验表明AlphaEval在评估一致性上与全面回测相当，但提供更全面的洞察和更高效率，能有效识别优于传统单指标筛选方法的alpha。

Conclusion: AlphaEval解决了alpha挖掘系统评估的关键挑战，所有实现和评估工具已开源以促进可复现性和社区参与。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种多模态心血管病治疗AI框架CardAIc-Agents，通过外部工具集成和适应性计划执行，充分利用了无继续学习知识库和多种输入输出模态，在三个数据集上表现超过主流视觉-语言模型和现有代理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管病治疗存在医疗工作者缺口问题，而现有AI代理在临床应用中遇到四大挑战：依赖内置模型能力缺少领域工具支持、固化序列工作流而临床需要适应性推理、知识库静态且无持续学习能力、输入输出模态固定且缺乏可视化输出支持。

Method: 提出CardAIc-Agents多模态框架：1）CardiacRAG代理从可更新心血知识中生成通用计划；2）主代理集成工具自主执行计划并做出决策；3）对复杂任务采用步进更新策略动态精炼计划；4）多学科讨论工具处理挑战性案例；5）提供可视化审查面板支持临床医生最终验证。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CardAIc-Agents在效率方面超过了主流视觉-语言模型（VLMs）、最先进的代理系统以及细调的VLMs。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种能够充分利用外部工具集成、适应性计划执行、持续知识更新和多模态输出的AI框架，有效解决了心血管病治疗中AI代理的临床应用挑战，为自动化早期检测和主动筛查提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

*Simon Hosemann,Jean Christoph Jung,Carsten Lutz,Sebastian Rudolph*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究如何从正负示例的关系结构中拟合本体和约束，分析不同描述逻辑和TGD类的计算复杂度、算法设计和本体大小，并探讨有限基的存在性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要从给定的正负示例中自动学习本体和约束，以支持知识表示和推理系统的构建

Method: 使用描述逻辑EL和ELI以及多种TGD类（全TGD、守卫TGD、边界守卫TGD、边界一TGD、无限制TGD和包含依赖）作为本体和约束语言，通过算法设计和复杂度分析来研究拟合问题

Result: 精确确定了计算复杂度，设计了相应算法，分析了拟合本体和TGD的大小，发现EL、ELI、守卫TGD和包含依赖存在有限基，而全TGD、边界守卫TGD和边界一TGD一般不存在有限基

Conclusion: 不同本体和约束语言在从示例中学习时具有不同的计算特性和有限基存在性，这为知识表示系统的自动构建提供了理论基础和实用指导

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

### [6] [A Hardware-oriented Approach for Efficient Active Inference Computation and Deployment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13177)
*Nikola Pižurica,Nikola Milović,Igor Jovančević,Conor Heins,Miguel de Prado*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种将pymdp的灵活性与硬件优化的稀疏计算图相结合的方法，显著降低了主动推理的计算延迟和内存需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主动推理(AIF)框架虽然强大，但其计算和内存需求在资源受限环境中部署存在挑战

Method: 整合pymdp的灵活性和效率，构建统一的稀疏计算图进行硬件优化执行

Result: 延迟降低超过2倍，内存减少高达35%

Conclusion: 该方法推进了高效主动推理代理在实时和嵌入式应用中的部署

Abstract: Active Inference (AIF) offers a robust framework for decision-making, yet its
computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment, especially in
resource-constrained environments. This work presents a methodology that
facilitates AIF's deployment by integrating pymdp's flexibility and efficiency
with a unified, sparse, computational graph tailored for hardware-efficient
execution. Our approach reduces latency by over 2x and memory by up to 35%,
advancing the deployment of efficient AIF agents for real-time and embedded
applications.

### [7] [The Interpretability Analysis of the Model Can Bring Improvements to the Text-to-SQL Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13178)
*Cong Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

### [8] [Search-Time Data Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13180)
*Ziwen Han,Meher Mankikar,Julian Michael,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 搜索基于LLM代理的评估存在搜索时污染问题，当代理通过搜索直接获取到测试数据集的答案时，导致评测结果失真。研究发现HuggingFace等平台成为污染源，并提出了相应的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别和解决搜索基于LLM代理评估中的新型污染问题，即搜索时污染（STC），确保评测结果的可靠性和准确性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索代理的日志记录，检测HuggingFace平台上测试数据集的泄漏情况，并通过屏蔽HuggingFace进行对比实验。

Result: 约3%的问题存在直接从HuggingFace获取答案的污染情况；屏蔽HuggingFace后，污染问题子集的准确率下降约15%；公开访问的评估数据集可能不是唯一污染源。

Conclusion: 建议采用更严格的测试集设计和结果报告最佳实践，以应对搜索时污染问题，确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可信过程。并公开实验日志以便审计。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

### [9] [QuickMerge++: Fast Token Merging with Autoregressive Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13204)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算成本的同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型处理更大规模输入，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的或不兼容自回归生成，需要一种更高效的动态token选择框架。

Method: 提出QuickMerge框架：1）基于注意力范数幅度动态选择重要token；2）使用基于熵的预算估计器指导token数量；3）引入轻量级transformer先验在合并后的token序列上进行训练，保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge在计算精度权衡方面取得一致改进，显著减少token数量的同时匹配甚至超过了学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的组合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成的有效框架，解决了大规模生成模型中的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

*Adamo Cerioli,Edward D. Lee,Vito D. P. Servedio*

TL;DR: 棋牌中人工智能与人类在战略决策中的差异：AI能维持更高水平的战略强度和复杂性，而人类因认知限制而选择控制游戏复杂度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类与AI在战略决策中的差异，了解即时机会与长期目标的罕量管理方式

Method: 使用网络基础的棋子相互作用指标来定量棋局中的战略强度，比较人类vs人类和AIvsAI游戏的动态变化

Result: AI玩家能维持更高水平的战略强度且持续更久，而人类玩家会限制强度和游戏复杂性；人类专业水平在1600和2300特等分数际有突然提升

Conclusion: AI和人类在战略决策上采取不同方式，AI能容忍长期攻防均衡的复杂局面，而人类受认知限制采取适应性策略，这对AI在复杂战略环境中的应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

TL;DR: 提出了多跳个性化推理任务，构建了数据集和评估框架，比较了显式和隐式记忆方法，提出了混合方法HybridMem来解决现有方法的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆的个性化方法主要关注偏好对齐和简单问答，但现实世界中复杂任务需要对大量用户信息进行多跳推理，当前记忆方法面临重大挑战

Method: 明确定义多跳个性化推理任务，构建数据集和统一评估框架，实现各种显式和隐式记忆方法，提出结合两种范式的混合方法HybridMem

Result: 通过综合实验从多角度评估各种方法的性能，分析其优缺点，证明了HybridMem方法的有效性

Conclusion: 多跳个性化推理是一个重要但具有挑战性的任务，混合记忆方法能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源和框架

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at
https://github.com/nuster1128/MPR.

Motivation: 科学文献中大量材料数据被困在非结构化的图表中，阻碍了基于大语言模型的AI智能体进行自动化材料设计

Method: 开发DIVE多智能体工作流，系统读取科学文献中的图形元素并组织实验数据，专注于固态氢存储材料

Result: 相比多模态模型直接提取，DIVE将准确性提高了10-15%（商业模型）和30%以上（开源模型），建立了包含4,000篇文献中30,000条数据的数据库，可在2分钟内识别新的氢存储材料成分

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛应用于不同材料领域，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated
materials design. Here, we present the Descriptive Interpretation of Visual
Expression (DIVE) multi-agent workflow, which systematically reads and
organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

*Chentong Chen,Mengyuan Zhong,Jianyong Sun,Ye Fan,Jialong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt框架通过前瞻性和后顾性提示策略，显著提升了基于LLM的自动启发式设计性能，实现了更快的收敛和更好的查询效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法存在静态算子和缺乏知识积累机制的问题，限制了其有效性

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，包含两种协同提示策略：前瞻性提示基于种群动态自适应引导搜索，管理探索-利用权衡；后顾性提示从历史成功启发式中提炼可重用设计原则，构建持久知识库

Result: 实验结果表明HiFo-Prompt显著优于现有最先进的基于LLM的AHD方法，生成更高质量的启发式，实现更快的收敛速度和优越的查询效率

Conclusion: 该框架通过将瞬时发现转化为持久知识库，使LLM能够从自身经验中学习，为自动启发式设计提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

### [15] [LOOP: A Plug-and-Play Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Enhancing Planning in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13371)
*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新颖的神经符号规划框架，通过神经网络和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在标准基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的神经规划方法在复杂领域表现不佳，产生缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉等问题。经典规划器虽然提供逻辑保证，但缺乏现代自主系统所需的灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有的神经符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，错失了神经和符号组件协同工作的机会。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括用于空间关系的图神经网络、基于共识正确性的多智能体验证、复杂任务管理的层次分解，以及从成功和失败中学习的因果记忆。该方法生成PDDL规范，基于符号反馈进行迭代优化，并从执行轨迹构建因果知识库。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准域上的评估显示，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）等现有方法。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络还是符号推理器，而在于让它们在整个过程真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信的关键现实世界应用自主系统提供了全面蓝图。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

### [16] [SPANER: Shared Prompt Aligner for Multimodal Semantic Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13387)
*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态的输入嵌入到统一的语义空间中，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态参数高效微调方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化能力。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中收敛，无论其模态如何。该设计具有可扩展性，支持无缝集成新模态。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展现出竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时在学习的嵌入空间中保持高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对齐嵌入结构比仅仅调整适配器权重对于可扩展的多模态学习更为重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理金融文档中高度非结构化、多页、异构的表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，在表格检测性能上超越现有模型10.1%，并能显著提升提取的资产信息量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界金融文档中的财务信息通常埋藏在杂乱、多页、碎片化的表格中（99.4%的表格没有边界框），传统方法难以有效处理这些高度非结构化的表格数据。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、建议模式修订并决定最终推荐，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER在表格检测上比Table Transformer等现有模型提升10.1%；更大的批量大小使可操作的模式建议增加104.3%，提取的资产信息增加9.8%；构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元资产的真实金融表格数据集。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升提取效果至关重要，发布的TASERTab数据集将为研究社区提供宝贵的真实金融表格资源。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学文献爆炸性增长和领域专业化带来的跨学科知识整合难题，探索通用型AI科学发现系统

Method: 构建领域无关的智能代理系统，自主设计并执行三项心理学研究（视觉工作记忆、心理旋转、意象生动度），在线收集288名参与者数据，开发分析流程

Result: AI系统能够进行非平凡研究，理论推理和方法严谨性媲美经验丰富的研究者，但在概念细微差别和理论解释方面存在局限

Conclusion: 这是实现能够通过真实实验验证假设的具身AI的重要一步，可自主探索人类认知和资源限制无法触及的科学领域，但引发了关于科学理解本质和科学贡献归属的重要问题

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

TL;DR: STPFormer是一个时空模式感知Transformer模型，通过统一的表示学习方法在交通预测任务中实现了最先进的性能，包含四个核心模块来处理复杂的时空模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在时空交通预测中存在时间编码僵化和时空融合能力弱的问题，需要一种能够统一处理复杂时空模式并具有可解释性的方法。

Method: 提出STPFormer模型，包含四个模块：Temporal Position Aggregator（TPA）用于模式感知时间编码，Spatial Sequence Aggregator（SSA）用于序列空间学习，Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching（STGM）用于跨域对齐，以及Attention Mixer用于多尺度融合。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，STPFormer始终取得了新的SOTA结果，消融实验和可视化验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: STPFormer通过统一的表示学习方法成功解决了时空交通预测中的关键挑战，为复杂时空模式建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation
and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出离散垂直最小最大违约问题(DMMV)作为通用优化框架，并设计GPU加速贫优算法，在语言模型量化、离散断层扫描和FIR滤波器设计中取得显著改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 很多应用场景需要在最坏情况下保证性能，需要一个通用的离散优化框架来最小化最大违约水平

Method: 数学定义DMMV问题并分析其性质，设计GPU加速的贫优算法，利用DMMV的数学特性加速求解

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升14%，离散断层扫描重建误差降低16%且GPU速度提升6倍，FIR滤波器设计波纹减少50%

Conclusion: DMMV作为通用优化框架具有广泛应用价值，提出的GPU加速贫优算法在多个领域都取得显著成效

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: 语言模型代理在安全知识和实际执行之间存在显著差距，研究发现了风险验证器系统可以有效减少风险行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别语言模型代理在安全知识认知和实际安全执行能力之间的显著差距，这种差距在安全关键场景中带来严重风险

Method: 开发了一个综合评估框架，从三个综度检查代理的安全性：风险知识、风险识别能力和实际行为避免。基于观察到的差距，开发了风险验证器系统，包括抽象器将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述

Result: 评估显示代理在风险知识上表现几乎完美（>98%），但在实际场景中识别风险的能力下降23%，并且仍然执行风险行为（<26%通过率）。风险验证器系统将风险行为执行减少55.3%

Conclusion: 简单扩大模型能力或推理计算并不能本质解决安全问题，需要专门的安全验证机制。风险验证器通过抽象化处理可以有效提升代理的安全性能

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Conclusion: CrafterDojo成功解决了Crafter环境缺乏基础模型支持的问题，为通用具身智能体研究提供了轻量级、原型友好的Minecraft-like测试环境。

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于电子健康记录的预测任务中表现不佳，现有方法无法提升LLM的内在推理能力且继承了深度学习模型的泛化限制

Method: 两阶段训练框架：1）使用专家指导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹来初始化LLM策略；2）通过强化学习优化策略，将LLM注意力与专家EHR模型识别的临床显著特征对齐

Result: 在两个真实世界EHR数据集上的实验显示，EAG-RL平均提升LLM的EHR推理能力14.62%，同时增强了对特征扰动的鲁棒性和对未见临床领域的泛化能力

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，能够有效提升LLM在电子健康记录推理方面的内在能力

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在需要深入理解信息丰富图像和生成结构化输出的任务中应用不足。图表转代码生成任务需要复杂的视觉推理，仅靠监督微调往往不够，需要有效的强化学习策略来适当奖励结构化输出。

Method: 提出MSRL方法：1)构建包含300万真实arXiv表格图表-代码对的最大训练语料库；2)设计多粒度结构化奖励系统，包括文本级的基于规则的细粒度代码验证和视觉级的基于模型的结构相似性评估；3)采用两阶段课程学习确保训练稳定性。

Result: MSRL显著突破SFT性能瓶颈，在ChartMimic和ReachQA基准测试中分别提升6.2%和9.9%的高层指标，达到与先进闭源模型竞争的性能水平。

Conclusion: 多模态结构化强化学习方法有效解决了图表转代码生成任务中的性能瓶颈问题，通过结合文本和视觉反馈的多粒度奖励机制，显著提升了结构化输出的生成质量。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general
reasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring
in-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured
outputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this
challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法，通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准上达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法依赖边界框或中心点回归，忽视了空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次结构。现有注意力方法存在两个关键问题：背景区域处理不当导致注意力漂移，以及统一标注无法区分目标UI元素的中心和边缘。

Method: V2P方法包含两个核心组件：1) 抑制注意力机制，最小化模型对无关区域的关注以突出目标区域；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘逐渐递减，方差由目标大小决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试中分别达到92.3%和50.5%的性能。消融实验证实了各组件对性能的贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法有效隔离目标区域并教导模型关注UI元素的最关键点，展示了在精确GUI定位任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Conclusion: ITL-LIME框架有效解决了LIME在数据稀缺情况下的性能问题，为黑盒模型提供了更稳定和可靠的解释方案

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效处理简历文本的语义复杂性、结构异质性和信息不完整性，成功解决简历重复检测的挑战

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results across various
tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge.
Developing AI systems with strong reasoning capabilities is regarded as a
crucial milestone in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and
has garnered considerable attention from both academia and industry. Various
techniques have been explored to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs,
with neuro-symbolic approaches being a particularly promising way. This paper
comprehensively reviews recent developments in neuro-symbolic approaches for
enhancing LLM reasoning. We first present a formalization of reasoning tasks
and give a brief introduction to the neurosymbolic learning paradigm. Then, we
discuss neuro-symbolic methods for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs
from three perspectives: Symbolic->LLM, LLM->Symbolic, and LLM+Symbolic.
Finally, we discuss several key challenges and promising future directions. We

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

*Minh Hoang Nguyen,Van Dai Do,Dung Nguyen,Thin Nguyen,Hung Le*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了小型开源LLM代理在协作任务中产生因果无效动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是小型开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这限制了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划能力。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，核心是结构因果动作（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前动作和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策。该结构用于通过因果评分指导动作选择，重新加权LLM生成的建议，或在需要时回退到因果基础的替代方案。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试的五个多代理协调任务和四个不同规模的LLM上评估，CausalPlan持续减少了无效动作，在AI-AI和人类-AI设置中都改善了协作性能，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多代理LLM系统的价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可实现干预一致的行为约束。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于公开语料构建LLM专业能力表进行专家代理动态选择；2）通过置信度融合和对抗验证实现多代理协作

Result: 在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Motivation: 量化公式给SMT求解器带来重大挑战，现有的各种实例化技术存在互补性，需要一种能够动态学习并结合这些技术优点的新方法。

Method: 将观察到的实例化视为潜在语言的样本，使用概率上下文自然法(PCFG)生成新的相似项，支持通过反转学习到的项概率来平衡利用和探索。

Result: 该方法能够模仿过去成功的实例化，同时通过探索多样性来改善量词推理的效果。

Conclusion: 通过动态学习多种实例化技术并使用概率语言模型生成新实例，为量化SMT求解提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Conclusion: 通过伪代码调试、反思和多变体选择的综合方法，可以有效提升LLM生成广义计划的成功率和质量

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large

virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

TL;DR: ComputerRL是一个自主桌面智能框架，通过API-GUI范式统一程序化API调用和直接GUI交互，解决机器代理与以人为中心的桌面环境之间的不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器代理在人类为中心的桌面环境中操作时的固有失配问题，以及扩展端到端强化学习训练在多样化桌面任务中的挑战。

Method: 开发分布式RL基础设施协调数千个并行虚拟桌面环境，提出Entropulse训练策略（强化学习与监督微调交替），采用API-GUI范式。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，基于GLM-4-9B-0414的AutoGLM-OS-9B达到了48.1%的最新最先进准确率，显著提升了桌面自动化通用代理的性能。

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过创新的API-GUI范式和可扩展的训练基础设施，成功提升了自主桌面智能代理的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et
al., 2024a)

*Stefanie Urchs,Veronika Thurner,Matthias Aßenmacher,Christian Heumann,Stephanie Thiemichen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种扩展的演员级流水线，用于检测和减少大规模文本语料库中的性别偏见，通过新的演员级指标来量化情感、语法能动性和引用风格的不对称性，并在德国报纸语料库中验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的输出往往反映了训练数据中的结构性性别不平衡问题，这会影响数字化沟通的公平性。需要开发更有效的方法来检测和减少语料库中的性别歧视问题。

Method: 构建了一个扩展的演员级流水线，包括新的演员级指标（情感不对称性、语法能动性、引用风格），支持诊断性语料分析和排除基于的平衡处理，用于构建更公平的语料库。

Result: 在taz2024full德国报纸语料库（1980-2024）中应用该方法，在多个语言维度上实现了显著的性别平衡改善。表面级别的不对称性可通过过滤和重新平衡来减少，但更细微的偏见形式（如情感和框架方面）仍然存在。

Conclusion: 该研究为语境基于公平性审计和公平语料库构建提供了有用的工具和报告，虽然表面偏见可以缓解，但深层的偏见问题仍需进一步研究和解决。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly shaping digital communication, yet
their outputs often reflect structural gender imbalances that originate from
their training data. This paper presents an extended actor-level pipeline for
detecting and mitigating gender discrimination in large-scale text corpora.
Building on prior work in discourse-aware fairness analysis, we introduce new
actor-level metrics that capture asymmetries in sentiment, syntactic agency,
and quotation styles. The pipeline supports both diagnostic corpus analysis and
exclusion-based balancing, enabling the construction of fairer corpora. We
apply our approach to the taz2024full corpus of German newspaper articles from
1980 to 2024, demonstrating substantial improvements in gender balance across
multiple linguistic dimensions. Our results show that while surface-level
asymmetries can be mitigated through filtering and rebalancing, subtler forms
of bias persist, particularly in sentiment and framing. We release the tools
and reports to support further research in discourse-based fairness auditing
and equitable corpus construction.

TL;DR: MM-BrowseComp是一个新的多模态网页浏览基准测试，包含224个手工制作的问题，专门评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力，现有最先进模型仅达到29.02%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网页浏览基准测试（如BrowseComp）主要关注文本信息，忽略了网页中普遍存在的多模态内容（图像、视频等），需要一个新的基准来评估AI代理的多模态检索和推理能力。

Method: 创建了MM-BrowseComp基准，包含224个具有挑战性的手工制作问题，这些问题在提示中经常包含图像，且关键信息可能嵌入在网页的图像或视频中。为每个问题提供验证清单，支持细粒度的多模态依赖性和推理路径分析。

Result: 对最先进模型（包括OpenAI o3 with tools）的全面评估显示，最高准确率仅为29.02%，表明当前模型的多模态能力不足，缺乏原生的多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: MM-BrowseComp基准突显了当前AI代理在多模态网页浏览方面的显著局限性，为未来多模态推理能力的发展提供了重要的评估框架和方向。

Abstract: AI agents with advanced reasoning and tool use capabilities have demonstrated
impressive performance in web browsing for deep search. While existing
benchmarks such as BrowseComp evaluate these browsing abilities, they primarily
focus on textual information, overlooking the prevalence of multimodal content.
To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-BrowseComp, a novel benchmark comprising
224 challenging, hand-crafted questions specifically designed to assess agents'
multimodal retrieval and reasoning capabilities. These questions often
incorporate images in prompts, and crucial information encountered during the
search and reasoning process may also be embedded within images or videos on
webpages. Consequently, methods relying solely on text prove insufficient for
our benchmark. Additionally, we provide a verified checklist for each question,
enabling fine-grained analysis of multimodal dependencies and reasoning paths.
Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models on MM-BrowseComp
reveals that even top models like OpenAI o3 with tools achieve only 29.02\%
accuracy, highlighting the suboptimal multimodal capabilities and lack of
native multimodal reasoning in current models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于RNN-T的ASR系统能够实时转写，但实现实时流式翻译仍面临重大挑战，需要在翻译质量和延迟之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出同步翻译方法，利用ASR系统生成的语言线索管理上下文，采用高效的分析剪枝技术（如超时和强制终止）保持系统实时性。

Result: 在设备上双语对话语音翻译中实验，在延迟和质量方面都超过基线方法，缩小了与非流式翻译系统的质量差距。

Conclusion: 该技术为更准确和高效的实时语音翻译抓埋了基础，提供了一种可行的流式翻译解决方案。

Abstract: This paper tackles several challenges that arise when integrating Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) for real-time, on-device
streaming speech translation. Although state-of-the-art ASR systems based on
Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T) can perform real-time
transcription, achieving streaming translation in real-time remains a
significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose a simultaneous
translation approach that effectively balances translation quality and latency.
We also investigate efficient integration of ASR and MT, leveraging linguistic
cues generated by the ASR system to manage context and utilizing efficient
beam-search pruning techniques such as time-out and forced finalization to
maintain system's real-time factor. We apply our approach to an on-device
bilingual conversational speech translation and demonstrate that our techniques
outperform baselines in terms of latency and quality. Notably, our technique
narrows the quality gap with non-streaming translation systems, paving the way
for more accurate and efficient real-time speech translation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了推理能力对大型语言模型在习语检测任务中的影响，发现推理效果比预期小且多变，大模型能准确理解习语含义，而小模型需要额外提供定义才能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理模型的发展，大型语言模型在需要逻辑步骤的任务上表现提升。习语检测作为需要先理解再消歧的语言任务，可能受益于推理框架，因此研究推理能力对习语检测的影响。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型系列（1.5B到70B参数）在四个习语检测数据集上进行评估，分析思维链推理的效果，并对小模型实验提供定义提示的方法。

Result: 推理效果比预期小且多变：小模型通过思维链推理能从数学调优中间模型提升性能，但达不到基础模型水平；大模型（14B、32B、70B）有适度提升。大模型能准确输出习语定义，小模型常失败。

Conclusion: 大模型在习语理解方面表现良好，能产生准确的定义；小模型需要额外提供定义信息才能在某些情况下提升习语检测性能，推理能力对习语检测的影响有限且因模型大小而异。

Abstract: The recent trend towards utilisation of reasoning models has improved the
performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across many tasks which involve
logical steps. One linguistic task that could benefit from this framing is
idiomaticity detection, as a potentially idiomatic expression must first be
understood before it can be disambiguated and serves as a basis for reasoning.
In this paper, we explore how reasoning capabilities in LLMs affect
idiomaticity detection performance and examine the effect of model size. We
evaluate, as open source representative models, the suite of DeepSeek-R1
distillation models ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters across four
idiomaticity detection datasets. We find the effect of reasoning to be smaller
and more varied than expected. For smaller models, producing chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning increases performance from Math-tuned intermediate models, but
not to the levels of the base models, whereas larger models (14B, 32B, and 70B)
show modest improvements. Our in-depth analyses reveal that larger models
demonstrate good understanding of idiomaticity, successfully producing accurate
definitions of expressions, while smaller models often fail to output the
actual meaning. For this reason, we also experiment with providing definitions
in the prompts of smaller models, which we show can improve performance in some
cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过从LLaMA模型蒸馏上下文知识到Whisper来增强ASR性能的新方法，在长音频转录中显著改善了词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点符号准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统在长音频转录中经常难以保持句法和语义准确性，影响了命名实体识别、大小写和标点符号等任务的表现。

Method: 使用两种策略：(1) 通过最优传输进行token级别的维度对齐和序列长度匹配的蒸馏；(2) 最小化Whisper和LLaMA句子嵌入之间的表示损失，融合句法和语义信息。

Result: 在Spoken Wikipedia数据集上的评估显示，词错误率、命名实体识别、大小写和标点符号成功率都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过引入新的NER指标和探索语义感知的ASR，这项工作凸显了将语言上下文整合到转录中的价值，为长语音的鲁棒、上下文感知ASR奠定了基础。

Abstract: ASR systems often struggle with maintaining syntactic and semantic accuracy
in long audio transcripts, impacting tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER),
capitalization, and punctuation. We propose a novel approach that enhances ASR
by distilling contextual knowledge from LLaMA models into Whisper. Our method
uses two strategies: (1) token level distillation with optimal transport to
align dimensions and sequence lengths, and (2) representation loss minimization
between sentence embeddings of Whisper and LLaMA, blending syntax and
semantics. Evaluations on the Spoken Wikipedia dataset, a benchmark with long
audios and rich entities demonstrate significant improvements in Word Error
Rate (WER), NER, capitalization, and punctuation success. By introducing novel
NER metrics and exploring semantics aware ASR, our work highlights the value of
integrating linguistic context into transcription, setting a foundation for
robust, context-aware ASR in longform speech.

TL;DR: Datarus-R1-14B是一个14B参数的开源语言模型，基于Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct微调，专门用于虚拟数据分析和研究生级别问题求解。该模型采用轨迹式训练方法，结合双奖励框架和GRPO优化，在多个领域基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统LLM在复杂问题求解中存在的格式崩溃、冗长循环和推理不连贯等问题，开发一个能够执行完整分析轨迹、包含代码执行和自我修正的专业级问题求解模型。

Method: 1) 使用轨迹中心合成数据生成器产生144,000个标记的笔记本片段；2) 双奖励框架结合轻量级结构信号和分层奖励模型；3) 内存优化的GRPO实现，包含KV缓存重用和顺序生成；4) 余弦课程学习从结构保真度平滑过渡到语义深度

Result: 在标准公开基准测试中超越同规模模型，甚至达到QwQ-32B等更大推理模型的水平，在AIME 2024/2025和LiveCodeBench上准确率提升高达30%，同时每个解决方案减少18-49%的token输出

Conclusion: Datarus通过轨迹式训练和双奖励优化，成功解决了RL对齐LLM常见的格式崩溃和冗长问题，展现出"顿悟时刻"模式，能够高效收敛到正确解决方案，为专业级问题求解提供了新的技术路径

Abstract: We present Datarus-R1-14B, a 14 B-parameter open-weights language model
fine-tuned from Qwen 2.5-14B-Instruct to act as a virtual data analyst and
graduate-level problem solver. Datarus is trained not on isolated
question-answer pairs but on full analytical trajectories including reasoning
steps, code execution, error traces, self-corrections, and final conclusions,
all captured in a ReAct-style notebook format spanning finance, medicine,
numerical analysis, and other quantitative domains. Our training pipeline
combines (i) a trajectory-centric synthetic data generator that yielded 144 000
tagged notebook episodes, (ii) a dual-reward framework blending a lightweight
tag-based structural signal with a Hierarchical Reward Model (HRM) that scores
both single-step soundness and end-to-end coherence, and (iii) a
memory-optimized implementation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
featuring KV-cache reuse, sequential generation, and reference-model sharding.
A cosine curriculum smoothly shifts emphasis from structural fidelity to
semantic depth, reducing the format collapse and verbosity that often plague
RL-aligned LLMs. A central design choice in Datarus is it dual reasoning
interface. In agentic mode the model produces ReAct-tagged steps that invoke
Python tools to execute real code; in reflection mode it outputs compact
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces delimited by <think> and <answer> tags. On
demanding postgraduate-level problems, Datarus exhibits an "AHA-moment"
pattern: it sketches hypotheses, revises them once or twice, and converges
avoiding the circular, token-inflating loops common to contemporary systems.
Across standard public benchmarks Datarus surpasses similar size models and
even reaches the level of larger reasoning models such as QwQ-32B achieving up
to 30% higher accuracy on AIME 2024/2025 and LiveCodeBench while emitting
18-49% fewer tokens per solution.

TL;DR: 通过参数高效微调方法，使用母语者的自由词汇联想规范来提升大语言模型的文化对齐能力，在英语和中文任务上均取得显著效果提升，7-8B模型性能可媲美70B基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在跨文化交流中仍存在训练语料分布偏差问题，当前缺乏有效的文化建模和对齐方法，需要探索基于人类认知的有效学习途径。

Method: 使用Small-World-of-Words项目的英语-美国和普通话词汇联想数据，通过监督微调(SFT)和基于PPO的偏好优化方法对Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B进行参数高效微调。

Result: SFT使英语P@5提升16-20%，中文提升43-165%；中位具体性提升+0.20；达到人类水平的情感效价和唤醒度；在世界价值观调查中答案分布向目标文化偏移；高张力问题中中文对齐响应翻倍，美国偏见减少三分之一。

Conclusion: 研究表明几百万个基于文化的词汇联想足以实现价值对齐，无需昂贵的重新训练，凸显了基于人类认知的研究在改善AI模型文化对齐方面的潜力和必要性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate cross-cultural
communication, their behavior still reflects the distributional bias of the
languages and viewpoints that are over-represented in their pre-training
corpora. Yet, it remains a challenge to model and align culture due to limited
cultural knowledge and a lack of exploration into effective learning
approaches. We introduce a cost-efficient, cognitively grounded remedy:
parameter-efficient fine-tuning on native speakers' free word-association
norms, which encode implicit cultural schemas. Leveraging English-US and
Mandarin associations from the Small-World-of-Words project, we adapt
Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and PPO-based
preference optimization. SFT boosts held-out association Precision at 5 by
16-20% in English and 43-165% in Mandarin, lifts median concreteness by +0.20,
and attains human-level valence and arousal. These lexical gains transfer: on
World-Values-Survey questions, fine-tuned models shift answer distributions
toward the target culture, and on a 50-item high-tension subset, Qwen's
Chinese-aligned responses double while Llama's US bias drops by one-third. Our
7-8B models rival or beat vanilla 70B baselines, showing that a few million
culture-grounded associations can instill value alignment without costly
retraining. Our work highlights both the promise and the need for future
research grounded in human cognition in improving cultural alignment in AI
models.

TL;DR: ProMed是一个强化学习框架，通过Shapley信息增益奖励将医疗大语言模型从被动回答转变为主动提问范式，显著提升了在部分信息医疗场景中的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗大语言模型主要采用被动回答模式，缺乏主动询问能力，这在需要交互信息收集的真实临床咨询中存在误诊风险。

Method: 提出两阶段训练框架：1）SIG引导的模型初始化使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高奖励交互轨迹；2）SIG增强的策略优化整合Shapley信息增益奖励，通过新颖的奖励分配机制针对性地优化信息性问题。

Result: 在两个新构建的部分信息医疗基准测试中，ProMed平均优于最先进方法6.29%，相比被动范式提升54.45%，且在域外案例中表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ProMed成功将医疗LLM转变为主动提问范式，通过Shapley信息增益奖励有效量化临床问题价值，显著提升了在交互医疗场景中的诊断准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical
consultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.
While medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a
reactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional
information, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To
address this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping
them with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before
decision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)
reward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the
amount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated
via Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)
SIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)
SIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a
novel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to
informative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two
newly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and
delivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing
robustly to out-of-domain cases.

TL;DR: 通过LoRA微调ALLAM-7B模型，使其能够生成沙特阿拉伯方言（哈吉赛和纳吉赛），提高方言控制能力和文本保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语言模型主要支持现代标准阿拉伯语，对沙特方言支持有限，影响了对真实方言变体的摘取能力

Method: 使用私有的沙特方言指令数据集（Hijazi和Najdi，5,466条合成指令-响应对），采用LoRA微调技术训练ALLAM-7B-Instruct-preview模型，测试两种方案：方言标签训练和无标签训练

Result: 方言标签模型取得最佳控制效果，将沙特方言率从47.97%提升到84.21%，并降低了标准阿拉伯语泄漏，文本保真度也有显著提升，超越了多个强大的通用指令模型

Conclusion: 通过显式方言标签和LoRA微调技术，可以有效地为阿拉伯语言模型添加方言生成能力，且避免了基线模型常见的元数据标签回显问题

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for Arabic are still dominated by Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), with limited support for Saudi dialects such as Najdi
and Hijazi. This underrepresentation hinders their ability to capture authentic
dialectal variation. Using a privately curated Saudi Dialect Instruction
dataset (Hijazi and Najdi; 5,466 synthetic instruction-response pairs; 50/50
split), we LoRA-tune ALLaM-7B-Instruct-preview, the first foundation model
developed in Saudi Arabia, for Saudi dialect generation. We investigate two
variants: (i) Dialect-Token training, which prepends an explicit dialect tag to
the instruction, and (ii) No-Token training, which omits the tag at formatting
time. Evaluation on a held-out test set combines an external dialect classifier
with text fidelity metrics (chrF++ and BERTScore) and diversity measures. The
Dialect-Token model achieves the best control, raising the Saudi rate from
47.97% to 84.21% and reducing MSA leakage from 32.63% to 6.21%; fidelity also
improves (chrF++ +3.53, BERTScore +0.059). Both LoRA variants outperform strong
generic instruction models (Falcon-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, AceGPT-v2-8B-Chat, JAIS-13B-Chat) in dialect control and
fidelity, while avoiding metadata-tag echoing that these baselines frequently
exhibit. We do not release the dataset or any model weights/adapters; instead,
we release training/evaluation/inference code and a detailed datasheet (schema
and aggregate statistics) to support independent verification.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在低资源语言泰卢固语中的真实能力，理解模型局限性，为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供信息。

Method: 构建包含729个多项选择题和开放式问题的评估数据集，评估11个开源和闭源大语言模型，进行细粒度分析，并比较模型作为评判者与人类评估的差异。

Result: 发现大语言模型在多项选择题中依赖表面启发式方法（如答案位置和干扰项模式），模型作为评判者在低资源语言中的可靠性需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 细粒度评估对于理解模型局限性至关重要，可以为开发更具语言能力的大语言模型提供指导，并为未来泰卢固语NLP研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MATA, a novel evaluation dataset to assess the
ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Telugu language, comprising 729
carefully curated multiple-choice and open-ended questions that span diverse
linguistic dimensions. We evaluate 11 open-weight and closed-source LLMs on our
dataset and present a fine-grained analysis of their performance. Further, we
empirically show how LLMs rely on superficial heuristics such as answer
position and distractor patterns for multiple-choice questions. Finally, we
also compare LLM-as-a-judge evaluation with human evaluation for open-ended
questions and draw some conclusions on its reliability in a low-resource
language. We argue that such fine-grained evaluation is essential for
understanding model limitations and can inform the development of more
linguistically capable LLMs, while also serving as a foundation for future
research in Telugu NLP.

TL;DR: 压缩模型在准确率相近时仍存在可解释性对齐和校准相似性的显著差异，不能简单替代原始大模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注压缩对准确率的影响，但性能对等并不保证信任对等，需要评估压缩模型是否值得信赖

Method: 提出二维信任对等评估框架：1)可解释性对齐(LIME和SHAP测试) 2)校准相似性(ECE、MCE、Brier Score和可靠性图)

Result: 实验显示压缩模型与原始BERT-base模型在可解释性对齐度低，校准相似性存在显著不匹配，即使准确率几乎相同

Conclusion: 压缩模型与大型模型不是信任对等的，部署压缩模型作为大模型的直接替代需要超越性能对等的仔细评估

Abstract: Large Deep Learning models are often compressed before being deployed in a
resource-constrained environment. Can we trust the prediction of compressed
models just as we trust the prediction of the original large model? Existing
work has keenly studied the effect of compression on accuracy and related
performance measures. However, performance parity does not guarantee
trust-equivalence. We propose a two-dimensional framework for trust-equivalence
evaluation. First, interpretability alignment measures whether the models base
their predictions on the same input features. We use LIME and SHAP tests to
measure the interpretability alignment. Second, calibration similarity measures
whether the models exhibit comparable reliability in their predicted
probabilities. It is assessed via ECE, MCE, Brier Score, and reliability
diagrams. We conducted experiments using BERT-base as the large model and its
multiple compressed variants. We focused on two text classification tasks:
natural language inference and paraphrase identification. Our results reveal
low interpretability alignment and significant mismatch in calibration
similarity. It happens even when the accuracies are nearly identical between
models. These findings show that compressed models are not trust-equivalent to
their large counterparts. Deploying compressed models as a drop-in replacement
for large models requires careful assessment, going beyond performance parity.

*Oriana Presacan,Alireza Nik,Vajira Thambawita,Bogdan Ionescu,Michael Riegler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在医疗领域LLM应用中，确定性解码策略（如beam search）通常优于随机策略，模型大小影响性能但解码策略选择有时比模型选择更重要，医疗专用LLM并未显示出整体优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域对文本生成的准确性要求极高，但解码策略对医疗LLM输出质量的影响尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估不同解码策略在医疗任务中的表现。

Method: 在5个开放式医疗任务（翻译、摘要、问答、对话、图像描述）上评估11种解码策略，使用医疗专用和通用LLM不同尺寸模型，比较多种评估指标。

Result: beam search表现最佳，随机采样策略最差；大模型性能更好但推理时间更长；医疗LLM仅在2/5任务中优于通用模型，且对解码策略更敏感；不同评估指标相关性因任务而异。

Conclusion: 医疗应用中需要谨慎选择解码方法，其影响有时超过模型选择本身，MAUVE等指标与BERTScore、ROUGE相关性较弱且对解码策略更敏感。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on various decoding strategies to generate
text, and these choices can significantly affect output quality. In healthcare,
where accuracy is critical, the impact of decoding strategies remains
underexplored. We investigate this effect in five open-ended medical tasks,
including translation, summarization, question answering, dialogue, and image
captioning, evaluating 11 decoding strategies with medically specialized and
general-purpose LLMs of different sizes. Our results show that deterministic
strategies generally outperform stochastic ones: beam search achieves the
highest scores, while {\eta} and top-k sampling perform worst. Slower decoding
methods tend to yield better quality. Larger models achieve higher scores
overall but have longer inference times and are no more robust to decoding.
Surprisingly, while medical LLMs outperform general ones in two of the five
tasks, statistical analysis shows no overall performance advantage and reveals
greater sensitivity to decoding choice. We further compare multiple evaluation
metrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak
agreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the
decoding strategy. These results highlight the need for careful selection of
decoding methods in medical applications, as their influence can sometimes
exceed that of model choice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语音LLM如Bark在语者选择中显示出某些性别偏向，但未发现系统性的性别偏见


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语音大语言模型是否与文本LLM相似，也存在性别偏见问题，通过语者分配来分析偏见

Method: 构建两个数据集：职业数据集（包含性别刻板化职业）和性别色彩词汇数据集，分析Bark TTS模型的默认语者分配

Result: Bark模型展现出性别意识，有些性别倾向，但没有系统性的性别偏见

Conclusion: 语音LLM在语者选择上显示出性别敏感性，但需要更多研究来全面理解其偏见模式

Abstract: Similar to text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities and context awareness. However, whether these similarities
extend to gender bias remains an open question. This study proposes a
methodology leveraging speaker assignment as an analytic tool for bias
investigation. Unlike text-based models, which encode gendered associations
implicitly, Speech-LLMs must produce a gendered voice, making speaker selection
an explicit bias cue. We evaluate Bark, a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model, analyzing
its default speaker assignments for textual prompts. If Bark's speaker
selection systematically aligns with gendered associations, it may reveal
patterns in its training data or model design. To test this, we construct two
datasets: (i) Professions, containing gender-stereotyped occupations, and (ii)
Gender-Colored Words, featuring gendered connotations. While Bark does not
exhibit systematic bias, it demonstrates gender awareness and has some gender
inclinations.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) faces significant
challenges when processing long documents in low-resource environments due to
context limitations and insufficient training data. This paper presents
AdaDocVQA, a unified adaptive framework addressing these challenges through
three core innovations: a hybrid text retrieval architecture for effective

TL;DR: CRISP是一种基于稀疏自编码器的参数高效方法，用于实现大语言模型中的持久概念遗忘，通过自动识别并抑制多层的显著特征来实现精确的知识移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，需要选择性移除有害知识同时保持模型效用的方法。现有稀疏自编码器方法主要在推理时干预，无法实现参数层面的持久改变，容易被恶意行为者绕过。

Method: CRISP使用稀疏自编码器自动识别多个层中的显著特征，并抑制这些特征的激活。该方法在参数层面实现持久的概念遗忘，而不是仅在推理时进行干预。

Result: 在两个大语言模型上的实验表明，CRISP在WMDP基准测试的安全关键遗忘任务上优于先前方法，成功移除有害知识的同时保持通用和领域内能力。特征级分析显示CRISP实现了目标和良性概念之间的语义连贯分离。

Conclusion: CRISP提供了一种有效的参数级概念遗忘方法，能够精确抑制目标特征，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了重要工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, the need to selectively remove unwanted knowledge while
preserving model utility has become paramount. Recent work has explored sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to perform precise interventions on monosemantic features.
However, most SAE-based methods operate at inference time, which does not
create persistent changes in the model's parameters. Such interventions can be
bypassed or reversed by malicious actors with parameter access. We introduce
CRISP, a parameter-efficient method for persistent concept unlearning using
SAEs. CRISP automatically identifies salient SAE features across multiple
layers and suppresses their activations. We experiment with two LLMs and show
that our method outperforms prior approaches on safety-critical unlearning
tasks from the WMDP benchmark, successfully removing harmful knowledge while
preserving general and in-domain capabilities. Feature-level analysis reveals
that CRISP achieves semantically coherent separation between target and benign
concepts, allowing precise suppression of the target features.

*Vy Tuong Dang,An Vo,Quang Tau,Duc Dm,Daeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了ViExam评测标准，评估了视觉语言模型在越南教育多模态考试中的性能，发现现有模型在跨语言多模态理解方面仍与人类有显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在英语多模态任务上表现出艰难的能力，但对于资源较少语言的真实多模态教育内容的性能仍未得到充分探索。本研究旨在测试VLMs在越南教育评估中的表现，调查主要培养在英语数据上的模型能否处理真实世界的跨语言多模态推理任务。

Method: 提出ViExam评测标准，包含2,548道多模态问题，涵盖7个学科领域（数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、驾驶考试和IQ测试）。评估了状态最优VLMs和开源模型的表现，对比了人类考生的成绩，并测试了跨语言提示和人机协作对性能的影响。

Result: 状态最优VLMs平均准确率仅为57.74%，开源模型为27.70%。大多数VLMs表现低于人类平均水平（66.54%），仅o3思维模型（74.07%）超过人类平均，但仍远远不及人类最佳表现（99.60%）。跨语言提示导致SOTA VLMs准确率下降1%，而人机协作可将VLM性能提高5%。

Conclusion: 现有VLMs在越南多模态教育考试中表现偏差，在跨语言多模态理解方面仍面临重大挑战。跨语言提示并不能有效改善性能，而人机协作才能部分提升模型表现。这一研究为跨语言多模态理解领域的研究提供了重要的基准和见解。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on English
multimodal tasks, but their performance on low-resource languages with
genuinely multimodal educational content remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we test how VLMs perform on Vietnamese educational assessments,
investigating whether VLMs trained predominantly on English data can handle
real-world cross-lingual multimodal reasoning. Our work presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of VLM capabilities on multimodal Vietnamese exams
through proposing ViExam, a benchmark containing 2,548 multimodal questions. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only 57.74% while open-source models
achieve 27.70% mean accuracy across 7 academic domains, including Mathematics,
Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Driving Test, and IQ Test. Most VLMs
underperform average human test-takers (66.54%), with only the thinking VLM o3
(74.07%) exceeding human average performance, yet still falling substantially
short of human best performance (99.60%). Cross-lingual prompting with English
instructions while maintaining Vietnamese content fails to improve performance,
decreasing accuracy by 1 percentage point for SOTA VLMs. Human-in-the-loop
collaboration can partially improve VLM performance by 5 percentage points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了28个大型语言模型在包含20种可被反驳推理模式的默认推理任务中的表现，发现当前LLM在默认推理方面既有潜力也有限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用概括词（如'鸟会飞'）具有复杂的异常允许特性，对语言学、哲学、逻辑学和认知科学都很重要，需要评估LLM在这些默认推理模式中的能力

Method: 使用28个大型语言模型进行可被反驳推理测试，测试包括零样本提示、少样本提示和思维链提示等不同提示方式

Result: 前沿模型在许多默认推理问题上表现良好，但性能在模型间和提示方式间差异显著；少样本提示使某些模型性能提升，但思维链提示导致严重性能下降（平均-11.14%）；大多数模型无法区分可被反驳和演绎推理，或将通用概括词误解为普遍语句

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在默认推理方面既显示出一定潜力，但仍面临重大限制，特别是在区分不同类型的推理和正确理解通用概括词的特性方面

Abstract: This paper evaluates the capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) to
reason with 20 defeasible reasoning patterns involving generic generalizations
(e.g., 'Birds fly', 'Ravens are black') central to non-monotonic logic.
Generics are of special interest to linguists, philosophers, logicians, and
cognitive scientists because of their complex exception-permitting behaviour
and their centrality to default reasoning, cognition, and concept acquisition.
We find that while several frontier models handle many default reasoning
problems well, performance varies widely across models and prompting styles.
Few-shot prompting modestly improves performance for some models, but
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting often leads to serious performance degradation
(mean accuracy drop -11.14%, SD 15.74% in models performing above 75% accuracy
in zero-shot condition, temperature 0). Most models either struggle to
distinguish between defeasible and deductive inference or misinterpret generics
as universal statements. These findings underscore both the promise and limits
of current LLMs for default reasoning.

Motivation: 探索如何准确理解深度学习模型中隐含的知识，并批判急当前通过预测语义特征来解释字向量知识的方法的偏差。

Method: 通过实验证明现有的语义特征预测方法甚至能够成功预测随机信息，从而提出这些方法主要反映的是向量空间的几何相似性而非真正的语义展现。

Result: 发现预测准确度并不能可靠地表明字向量含有对应知识，因为这些方法的结果主要由算法上限决定，而非字向量的意义表征。仅依靠预测性能进行数据集比较是不可靠的。

Conclusion: 当前的字向量知识解释方法存在根本性缺陷，需要发展更可靠的方法来真正理解大语言模型中编码的知识。

Abstract: Understanding what knowledge is implicitly encoded in deep learning models is
essential for improving the interpretability of AI systems. This paper examines
common methods to explain the knowledge encoded in word embeddings, which are
core elements of large language models (LLMs). These methods typically involve
mapping embeddings onto collections of human-interpretable semantic features,
known as feature norms. Prior work assumes that accurately predicting these
semantic features from the word embeddings implies that the embeddings contain
the corresponding knowledge. We challenge this assumption by demonstrating that
prediction accuracy alone does not reliably indicate genuine feature-based
interpretability.
  We show that these methods can successfully predict even random information,
concluding that the results are predominantly determined by an algorithmic
upper bound rather than meaningful semantic representation in the word
embeddings. Consequently, comparisons between datasets based solely on
prediction performance do not reliably indicate which dataset is better
captured by the word embeddings. Our analysis illustrates that such mappings
primarily reflect geometric similarity within vector spaces rather than
indicating the genuine emergence of semantic properties.

Abstract: With the widespread application of electroencephalography (EEG) in
neuroscience and clinical practice, efficiently retrieving and semantically
interpreting large-scale, multi-source, heterogeneous EEG data has become a
pressing challenge. We propose EEG-MedRAG, a three-layer hypergraph-based
retrieval-augmented generation framework that unifies EEG domain knowledge,
individual patient cases, and a large-scale repository into a traversable n-ary
relational hypergraph, enabling joint semantic-temporal retrieval and
causal-chain diagnostic generation. Concurrently, we introduce the first
cross-disease, cross-role EEG clinical QA benchmark, spanning seven disorders
and five authentic clinical perspectives. This benchmark allows systematic
evaluation of disease-agnostic generalization and role-aware contextual
understanding. Experiments show that EEG-MedRAG significantly outperforms
TimeRAG and HyperGraphRAG in answer accuracy and retrieval, highlighting its
strong potential for real-world clinical decision support. Our data and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在需要事实严谨的领域中常显示奇恶风骟，这在科学问答等高风险场景中带来严重风险，但相关研究仍然不足。

Method: 提出统一的评估框架来量化奇恶上下文对模型行为的影响，包括对抗性提示设置和目标指标。还提出了Pressure-Tune方法，通过在合成对抗对话和思维链理由上进行轻量级微调。

Result: 系统性评估显示开源和专有模型都存在普遍的奇恶倾向，这更多由对齐策略驱动而非模型大小。Pressure-Tune能显著提高奇恶对抗力而不影响准确性或对有效反馈的响应能力。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个实用的途径来减少模型的奇恶风骟，促进更真实和有原则的模型行为，对高风险应用场景具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), while increasingly used in domains requiring
factual rigor, often display a troubling behavior: sycophancy, the tendency to
align with user beliefs regardless of correctness. This tendency is reinforced
by preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction
but can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,
sycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific
question answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,
decision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this
phenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts. We address this gap by
introducing a unified evaluation framework to quantify the impact of
sycophantic context on model behavior in scientific QA, measuring how much
user-imposed social pressure distorts model outputs. The framework incorporates
adversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading
resistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to
maintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations
across open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic
tendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate
this issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that
fine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with
chain-of-thought rationales. These rationales reject user misinformation while
reinforcing factual commitments. Experiments on challenging scientific QA
benchmarks show that Pressure-Tune significantly enhances sycophancy resistance
without compromising accuracy or responsiveness to valid feedback, offering a
practical pathway toward more truthful and principled model behavior.

Motivation: 当前机器生成文本检测器在同领域训练测试时表现良好，但在跨领域场景中由于领域偏移而泛化能力差

Method: 通过频域分析发现机器生成文本与人类写作文本在频谱模式上存在显著差异，设计了低频域过滤模块去除领域敏感特征，采用动态频谱对齐策略提取任务特定和领域不变特征

Result: 在11个测试数据集和三种领域泛化场景中，MGT-Prism平均准确率提升0.90%，F1分数提升0.92%，优于最先进基线方法

Conclusion: 频域分析为机器生成文本检测提供了新的视角，MGT-Prism方法能够有效应对领域偏移问题，提升检测器的跨领域泛化能力

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown growing ability to generate fluent and
coherent texts that are highly similar to the writing style of humans. Current
detectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained
and tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to
domain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose
MGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain
for better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text
representations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral
patterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude
emerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates
the design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the
document-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic
spectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant
features for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test
datasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型生成文本与儿童语言的相似性，以了解LLM在教育领域的适用性

Method: 使用图片故事描述任务，通过零次提示和少量提示生成LLM文本语料，并与实际儿童语料进行心理语言学性质对比分析

Result: LLM生成文本更长但词汇更谬穷，依赖高频词，名词使用不足，语义相似性低，少量提示仅能稍微改善

Conclusion: LLM生成的语言与儿童语言存在显著差异，在儿童教育工具中使用需谨慎考虑

Abstract: The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is increasing, yet
little attention has been paid to whether LLM-generated text resembles child
language. This study evaluates how LLMs replicate child-like language by
comparing LLM-generated texts to a collection of German children's descriptions
of picture stories. We generated two LLM-based corpora using the same picture
stories and two prompt types: zero-shot and few-shot prompts specifying a
general age from the children corpus. We conducted a comparative analysis
across psycholinguistic text properties, including word frequency, lexical
richness, sentence and word length, part-of-speech tags, and semantic
similarity with word embeddings. The results show that LLM-generated texts are
longer but less lexically rich, rely more on high-frequency words, and
under-represent nouns. Semantic vector space analysis revealed low similarity,
highlighting differences between the two corpora on the level of corpus
semantics. Few-shot prompt increased similarities between children and LLM text
to a minor extent, but still failed to replicate lexical and semantic patterns.
The findings contribute to our understanding of how LLMs approximate child
language through multimodal prompting (text + image) and give insights into
their use in psycholinguistic research and education while raising important
questions about the appropriateness of LLM-generated language in child-directed
educational tools.

Conclusion: TracSum基准和提出的方法能有效提升医学摘要的可追溯性和事实准确性，为可追溯的基于方面的摘要任务提供了可靠评估标准。

Abstract: While document summarization with LLMs has enhanced access to textual
information, concerns about the factual accuracy of these summaries persist,
especially in the medical domain. Tracing evidence from which summaries are
derived enables users to assess their accuracy, thereby alleviating this
concern. In this paper, we introduce TracSum, a novel benchmark for traceable,
aspect-based summarization, in which generated summaries are paired with
sentence-level citations, enabling users to trace back to the original context.
First, we annotate 500 medical abstracts for seven key medical aspects,
yielding 3.5K summary-citation pairs. We then propose a fine-grained evaluation
framework for this new task, designed to assess the completeness and
consistency of generated content using four metrics. Finally, we introduce a
summarization pipeline, Track-Then-Sum, which serves as a baseline method for
comparison. In experiments, we evaluate both this baseline and a set of LLMs on
TracSum, and conduct a human evaluation to assess the evaluation results. The
findings demonstrate that TracSum can serve as an effective benchmark for
traceable, aspect-based summarization tasks. We also observe that explicitly
performing sentence-level tracking prior to summarization enhances generation
accuracy, while incorporating the full context further improves completeness.

Result: 大语言模型能够生成准确的一阶指令序列，但在生成高阶代码（函数、循环等抽象）方面遇到困难

Conclusion: 大语言模型在协作机器人编程中具有潜力，特别是在基础指令生成方面，但在复杂抽象能力上仍需改进

Abstract: While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household
environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on
shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there.
``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly
lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make
changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs.
To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs),
and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for
conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the
``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation
for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer'
instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be
built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We
create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions
(human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With
this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for
synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a
simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate
`first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing
`higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).

(majority or inclusion rules), we model annotator disagreements to capture both
aleatoric uncertainty (inherent human disagreement) and epistemic uncertainty
(model domain sensitivity). We evaluate top language models (Claude Sonnet 4,
DeepSeek-V3, Llama 4 Maverick) across 250K+ annotations from ~700 annotators on
100K+ texts spanning social media, news, and forums.
  Our GPU-optimized Bayesian framework processed 1M+ model queries, revealing
that AI models typically rank among the top 25\% of human annotators, achieving
much better-than-average balanced accuracy. Importantly, we find that AI
produces far fewer false negatives than humans, highlighting their more
sensitive moral detection capabilities.

### [67] [Prompt-Based One-Shot Exact Length-Controlled Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13805)
*Juncheng Xie,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过插入计数器标记和明确计数规则的提示策略，使得大语言模型能够准确控制生成文本的长度，无需微调或迭代金矿


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在生成文本时经常无法准确遵循明确的长度指令，因为它们无法可靠地进行内部词段计数

Method: 提出一种基于提示的一次性策略，在提示中添加计数器标记和明确的计数规则，让模型在写作过程中同时进行计数

Result: 在MT-Bench-LI任务中，GPT-4.1的严格长度遵循率从累纯提示下的30%以下提升到95%以上，超越了流行的草稿-然后修计基线方法，同时保持了评估答案质量

Conclusion: 突出了仅通过提示工程就可以实现准确的长度控制，为训练或解码基于方法提供了轻量级的替代方案

Abstract: Controlling the length of text produced by large language models (LLMs)
remains challenging: models frequently overshoot or undershoot explicit length
instructions because they cannot reliably keep an internal token count. We
present a prompt-based, one-shot strategy that compels an off-the-shelf LLM to
generate exactly a desired number of tokens - words (English) or characters
(Chinese) - without any fine-tuning or iterative sampling. The prompt appends
countdown markers and explicit counting rules so that the model "writes while
counting." We evaluate on four settings: open-ended generation (1-1000 tokens),
XSUM summarization, MT-Bench-LI instruction following, and the LIFEBENCH
equal-length track. On MT-Bench-LI, strict length compliance with GPT-4.1 leaps
from below 30% under naive prompts to above 95% with our countdown prompt,
surpassing the popular draft-then-revise baseline, while judged answer quality
is preserved. These results show that precise length control can be achieved
through prompt engineering alone, offering a lightweight alternative to
training- or decoding-based methods.

TL;DR: 自动评估指标在NLG预计人类判断方面仍面临重大挑战，没有单一指标能成为最佳解决方案，需要根据任务特定需求选择并采用互补性评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估指标在自然语言生成预计人类判断方面的效果不一致，但现有研究常随意选择指标而不考虑其影响，需要系统性分析现有指标的强势、限制和验证方法

Method: 通过对现有自动评估指标进行彻底检查，包括其方法论、文档化强势限制、验证方法以及与人类判断的相关性分析

Result: 发现指标通常只能捐描文本质量的特定方面，效果随任务和数据集而异，验证实践结构化不足，与人类判断的相关性不稳定，这些问题在最新的LLM-as-a-Judge指标和RAG评估中仍存在

Conclusion: 询求"完美指标"的追求受到挑战，建议根据任务特定需求选择指标，利用互补性评估，新指标应重点关注改进验证方法论

Abstract: Evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) is crucial for the practical
adoption of AI, but has been a longstanding research challenge. While human
evaluation is considered the de-facto standard, it is expensive and lacks
scalability. Practical applications have driven the development of various
automatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with
human-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.
Over time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic
similarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators. However, it
seems that no single metric has emerged as a definitive solution, resulting in
studies using different ones without fully considering the implications. This
paper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the
methodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,
validation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several
key challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,
their effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain
unstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.
Importantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of
metric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry. Our
findings challenge the quest for the 'perfect metric'. We propose selecting
metrics based on task-specific needs and leveraging complementary evaluations
and advocate that new metrics should focus on enhanced validation
methodologies.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM)
with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate the extraction of
requirements from unstructured French Building Technical Specification (BTS)
documents within the construction industry. Employing Named Entity Recognition
(NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) techniques, the study leverages the
transformer-based model CamemBERT and applies transfer learning with the French
language model Fr\_core\_news\_lg, both pre-trained on a large French corpus in
the general domain. To benchmark these models, additional approaches ranging
from rule-based to deep learning-based methods are developed. For RE, four
different supervised models, including Random Forest, are implemented using a
custom feature vector. A hand-crafted annotated dataset is used to compare the
effectiveness of NER approaches and RE models. Results indicate that CamemBERT
and Fr\_core\_news\_lg exhibited superior performance in NER, achieving
F1-scores over 90\%, while Random Forest proved most effective in RE, with an
F1 score above 80\%. The outcomes are intended to be represented as a knowledge
graph in future work to further enhance automatic verification systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MME-SCI是一个针对多模态大语言模型的多语言科学推理基准测试，涵盖数学、物理、化学、生物四个学科，支持五种语言，包含1019个高质量问题，旨在解决现有基准在推理能力评估、模态覆盖和知识标注方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学领域的多模态大语言模型评估基准存在三个主要问题：多语言场景下推理能力评估不足、模态覆盖不全面、科学知识点标注不够细粒度。

Method: 收集了1019个高质量问答对，涵盖4个学科（数学、物理、化学、生物）和5种语言（中文、英文、法文、西班牙文、日文），包含3种评估模式，对16个开源模型和4个闭源模型进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示MME-SCI对现有MLLMs具有广泛挑战性，例如在仅图像评估模式下，o4-mini在数学、物理、化学、生物上的准确率分别仅为52.11%、24.73%、36.57%和29.80%，难度显著高于现有基准。

Conclusion: MME-SCI是一个全面且具有挑战性的基准测试，能够深入分析现有模型在特定领域的弱点，为多模态大语言模型的科学推理能力评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant
advancements across various domains, and corresponding evaluation benchmarks
have been continuously refined and improved. In this process, benchmarks in the
scientific domain have played an important role in assessing the reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks still face three key
challenges: 1) Insufficient evaluation of models' reasoning abilities in
multilingual scenarios; 2) Inadequate assessment of MLLMs' comprehensive
modality coverage; 3) Lack of fine-grained annotation of scientific knowledge
points. To address these gaps, we propose MME-SCI, a comprehensive and
challenging benchmark. We carefully collected 1,019 high-quality
question-answer pairs, which involve 3 distinct evaluation modes. These pairs
cover four subjects, namely mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, and
support five languages: Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Japanese. We
conducted extensive experiments on 16 open-source models and 4 closed-source
models, and the results demonstrate that MME-SCI is widely challenging for
existing MLLMs. For instance, under the Image-only evaluation mode, o4-mini
achieved accuracy of only 52.11%, 24.73%, 36.57%, and 29.80% in mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and biology, respectively, indicating a significantly
higher difficulty level compared to existing benchmarks. More importantly,
using MME-SCI's multilingual and fine-grained knowledge attributes, we analyzed
existing models' performance in depth and identified their weaknesses in
specific domains. The Data and Evaluation Code are available at

Result: 在HotelRec数据集上，ReviewGraph性能与大语言模型相当，但计算成本更低；在Cohen's Kappa等一致性指标上优于基线方法

Conclusion: 基于图的表示方法在评论分析中具有潜力，为未来集成图神经网络和微调LLM提取方法的研究奠定了基础

Abstract: In the hospitality industry, understanding the factors that drive customer
review ratings is critical for improving guest satisfaction and business
performance. This work proposes ReviewGraph for Review Rating Prediction (RRP),
a novel framework that transforms textual customer reviews into knowledge
graphs by extracting (subject, predicate, object) triples and associating
sentiment scores. Using graph embeddings (Node2Vec) and sentiment features, the
framework predicts review rating scores through machine learning classifiers.
We compare ReviewGraph performance with traditional NLP baselines (such as Bag
of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec) and large language models (LLMs), evaluating
them in the HotelRec dataset. In comparison to the state of the art literature,
our proposed model performs similar to their best performing model but with
lower computational cost (without ensemble).
  While ReviewGraph achieves comparable predictive performance to LLMs and
outperforms baselines on agreement-based metrics such as Cohen's Kappa, it
offers additional advantages in interpretability, visual exploration, and
potential integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This
work highlights the potential of graph-based representations for enhancing
review analytics and lays the groundwork for future research integrating
advanced graph neural networks and fine-tuned LLM-based extraction methods. We

Conclusion: LongMab-PO框架有效解决了长上下文建模中的数据质量和多样性问题，为提升LLM的长文本处理能力提供了新思路

Abstract: Long-context modeling is critical for a wide range of real-world tasks,
including long-context question answering, summarization, and complex reasoning
tasks. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)
with synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the
effectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and
factual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we
propose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)
rollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long
context for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing
preference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.
Specifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on
their expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and
iteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and
exploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context
segments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.
Finally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and
apply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM. Experimental results show
that LongMab-PO significantly improves the diversity and quality of preference
data pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-context reasoning
benchmarks. All code and data will be released on

TL;DR: 提出SvS策略，通过自对弈和变分问题合成来维持强化学习训练中的策略熵，显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的Pass@k性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR训练虽然提高了Pass@1性能，但导致策略熵降低，减少了生成多样性，限制了Pass@k性能的上限

Method: 提出在线自对弈变分问题合成(SvS)策略，利用策略的正确解合成变分问题，同时保持参考答案不变，有效维持训练过程中的策略熵

Result: 在AIME24和AIME25基准测试中Pass@32性能分别获得18.3%和22.8%的绝对提升，在12个推理基准和3B到32B不同模型规模上均表现出良好泛化性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: SvS策略通过维持策略熵有效解决了RLVR训练中的多样性退化问题，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的整体性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a key paradigm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for
complex reasoning tasks. However, vanilla RLVR training has been shown to
improve Pass@1 performance at the expense of policy entropy, leading to reduced
generation diversity and limiting the Pass@k performance, which typically
represents the upper bound of LLM reasoning capability. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the policy's generation diversity from the perspective
of training problems and find that augmenting and updating training problems
helps mitigate entropy collapse during training. Based on these observations,
we propose an online Self-play with Variational problem Synthesis (SvS)
strategy for RLVR training, which uses the policy's correct solutions to
synthesize variational problems while ensuring their reference answers remain
identical to the originals. This self-improving strategy effectively maintains
policy entropy during training and substantially improves Pass@k compared with
standard RLVR, sustaining prolonged improvements and achieving absolute gains
of 18.3% and 22.8% in Pass@32 performance on the competition-level AIME24 and
AIME25 benchmarks. Experiments on 12 reasoning benchmarks across varying model
sizes from 3B to 32B consistently demonstrate the generalizability and
robustness of SvS.

Motivation: 大语言模型在组织任务精细调整过程中容易出现安全问题，导致模型更容易执行有害任务且更少拒绝这些任务。需要一种方法来解决这个安全挑战。

Method: 提出Prefix INjection Guard (PING)方法，通过在代理响应前添加自动生成的自然语言前缀来指导代理拒绝有害请求。采用迭代方法轮流生成候选前缀并选择能同时优化任务性能和拒绝行为的前缀。

Result: 实验结果显示PING在保持良性任务性能的同时显著提升了精细调整后LLM代理的安全性。在网页导航和代码生成任务的多样化测试中均超过现有提示方法。线性探针分析显示前缀token对行为修改至关重要。

Conclusion: PING是一种简单但有效的方法，能够在不稍影响任务性能的前提下有效提升组织化LLM的安全性，解决了精细调整过程中容易出现的安全问题。

Abstract: Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into
agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to
solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific
tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently
overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned
LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of
executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned
to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix
INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends
automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding
them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1)
generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task
performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING
significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing
their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting
approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation
tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that
prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance
gains. WARNING: This paper contains contents that are unethical or offensive in

Motivation: 数字健康分析面临关键挑战：患者生成的健康内容包含复杂情感和医疗背景，需要稀缺的领域专业知识，而传统ML方法受限于医疗环境中的数据短缺和隐私限制。在线健康社区中的混合情感帖子、临床术语和隐含情感表达需要专业知识进行准确情感分析。

Abstract: Digital health analytics face critical challenges nowadays. The sophisticated
analysis of patient-generated health content, which contains complex emotional
and medical contexts, requires scarce domain expertise, while traditional ML
approaches are constrained by data shortage and privacy limitations in
healthcare settings. Online Health Communities (OHCs) exemplify these
challenges with mixed-sentiment posts, clinical terminology, and implicit
emotional expressions that demand specialised knowledge for accurate Sentiment
Analysis (SA). To address these challenges, this study explores how Large
Language Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context
learning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data
analysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically
encodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply
domain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive
training. Six GPT models validated alongside DeepSeek and LLaMA 3.1 are
compared with pre-trained language models (BioBERT variants) and lexicon-based
methods, using 400 expert-annotated posts from two OHCs. LLMs achieve superior
performance while demonstrating expert-level agreement. This high agreement,
with no statistically significant difference from inter-expert agreement
levels, suggests knowledge integration beyond surface-level pattern
recognition. The consistent performance across diverse LLM models, supported by
in-context learning, offers a promising solution for digital health analytics.
This approach addresses the critical challenge of expert knowledge shortage in
digital health research, enabling real-time, expert-quality analysis for
patient monitoring, intervention assessment, and evidence-based health
strategies.

Result: 发现长输入上下文提高动力学预测性能，SAE捕获的特征与能量等关键物理变量相关

Conclusion: 这为理解LLM如何在上下文中学习提供了新案例，证明有意义的物理概念在学习过程中被编码

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive in-context learning (ICL)
abilities, enabling them to solve wide range of tasks via textual prompts
alone. As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues
to expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or
internal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,
distinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a
promising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such
as basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide
experimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics
grounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for
studying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable
setting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,
especially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics
forecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can
learn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics
forecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such
capability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations
using sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features
captured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These
findings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs
during in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that
broadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现当前多选VQA基准存在严重偏差，视觉语言模型可以通过简单的视觉-选项相似度匹配来猜测正确答案，而不需要理解问题，这导致评估结果失真。

Method: 通过接地实验分析偏差原因，提出GroundAttack工具包自动生成视觉上合理的困难负选项，应用于NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建无偏标注。

Result: 在无偏标注上，当前VLMs在(V+O)设置下接近随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下准确率大幅下降，提供了更真实的VLM问答能力评估。

Conclusion: 揭示了VQA基准中的系统性偏差问题，提出的解决方案能创建更公平的评估环境，有助于真实评估视觉语言模型的问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室干净环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像质量参差不齐且经过多种编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含互联网收集和合成的AI生成图像），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习）和推理时自适应思考策略

Conclusion: Mirage基准有效模拟了真实世界AI生成图像的复杂性，Mirage-R1模型通过创新的推理机制和训练策略，在检测性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉问题，在OCR任务上表现优于非推理模型和专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中容易产生幻觉，且相比领域专家模型效果较差，需要解决这些问题。

Method: 提出推理-工具交织的VLM框架：先自行识别图像内容，再调用专家模型获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像和推理过程得出最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合推理和工具调用，有效减少了VLM的幻觉问题，以较低成本提升了OCR性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

Conclusion: 组件基于的卷积神经网络方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂形态结构，避免了传统分割方法的高错误率问题

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的有序分类问题，具有重要应用潜力

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released

<details>

Motivation: 步态识别缺乏大规模标注数据集，且收集多样化步态样本时面临隐私保护难题，需要一种能够生成高质量合成数据的方法。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，通过条件控制生成时序一致且保持身份特征的步态序列，支持身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 将合成样本加入步态识别流程能提升性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份具有独特一致的步态模式，可用于模型训练同时保护真实主体隐私。

Conclusion: 该研究在利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且隐私感知的步态数据生成方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an
environmental expert, a conservator-restorer, and a diagnostic coordinator. To
evaluate the system we selected 28 difficult images involving multiple
deterioration patterns. Our first results showed a huge boost on all metrics of
our system compared to the foundational model.

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个用于自动驾驶多视角视觉语言模型的即插即用视觉token剪枝框架，通过多样性感知token选择机制和视图自适应剪枝控制器，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，这阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出两个核心创新：1）受最远点采样启发的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据每个摄像头视图对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，当仅保留10%视觉token时，预填充阶段实现6.4倍加速，仅消耗原始FLOPs的13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为自动驾驶视觉语言模型的实际部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本，在多个数据集上显著优于现有感知攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果，需要开发新的感知对齐对抗攻击方法。

Method: DAASH采用多阶段方式运行：每个阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真，动态调节每个基础攻击的贡献。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上评估显示，DAASH显著优于最先进的感知攻击AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，在SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标上分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural

computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

Conclusion: 知识蓄粉和结构化多代理监督能够让轻量级VLM拥有复杂推理能力，VISTA的紧凑架构方便在边缘设备上部署，实现实时风险监控。

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统隐式神经表示(INRs)为每张图像使用单独MLP导致的计算和存储效率低下问题

Method: 分析训练好的INRs层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外投影层捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可处理100张图像且平均PSNR达34dB

Conclusion: MINR方法有效解决了多图像编码的效率问题，具有鲁棒性和良好的扩展性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INRs量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化策略。

Method: 使用Hadamard变换将不同层的权重和激活值分布标准化为统一的钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器。提出了FPGA实现方案。

Result: 在图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本减少延迟32.7%、能耗40.1%、资源使用最高98.3%，优于现有量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的Hadamard量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值的分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INRs的硬件部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: 多任务学习结合层次注意力机制能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，2D和3D CNN的融合提供了更优称的空间时间特征表征，为微表情识别领域提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial
information across diverse driving scenarios. Nevertheless, the sparse and
noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 传统HDR技术忽视了快门速度和ISO之间的复杂交互作用，以及动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致高ISO产生噪声、长快门引发模糊的问题

Method: 采用强化学习算法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图来优化快门速度和ISO组合的选择

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了最先进的性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算自适应地选择最优的曝光策略

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE方法能够有效解决动态场景HDR拍摄中的曝光参数优化问题，提供比传统方法更好的曝光调度方案

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的图像标记化器VGQ，通过集成2D高斯分布来改善对几何结构的建模，显著提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化基于标记化器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征如纹理和颜色，忽略了几何结构，导致结构信息模型化不足。

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将传统视觉码本金矿量化与2D高斯分布相结合，通过直接建模位置、旋转和缩放等结构相关参数来编码图像潜在表示。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试中，VGQ达到了rFID 1.00的重建质量。通过增加2D高斯密度，进一步获得rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的独到水平，显著超过现有方法。

Conclusion: VGQ通过集成2D高斯分布有效改善了对视觉结构的建模能力，提供了标记效率与视觉丰富性之间的灵活承偿，为AR图像生成领域的标记化器设计提供了新的视角。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人6D姿态估计设计的工业环境数据集，包含92个真实场景和16个独特物体，解决了现有数据集局限于家庭小物体的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计数据集主要关注机械臂操作的小型家庭物品，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中面临的远距离感知、严重自遮挡、大尺寸物体和多样化视角等挑战。

Method: 创建了包含92个真实场景和16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，特别捕捉了移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示现有6D姿态估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的姿态估计方法奠定了基础，填补了工业环境6D姿态估计数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，几何知识引导的分布检验方法能有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失问题，在多个标准数据集上都取得了性能提升

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有3DGS基于的头部虚拟人重建方法在捕捉细微面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面仍面临挑战，特别是在高可变形区域

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯光影响邻近高斯光的变形；利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供可靠面部几何结构指导

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够产生更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，具有更好的表情可控性和细节保真度

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了现有方法在细微面部表情捕捉和局部纹理连续性方面的限制

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，导致频谱偏差和难以捕捉高频细节的问题

Method: 提出FLAIR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) WEGE编码机制，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式指导频率信息到网络

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INRs

Conclusion: FLAIR通过引入频率选择和空间定位机制，有效解决了隐式神经表示的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的表示能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可以用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量化生成式人脸视频编码框架，通过双模式优化技术（结构重设和操作精细化），在保持重建质量的同时大幅降低了模型参数和计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）在码率-头真性能方面表现优异，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。需要一种轻量化方案来支持资源受限环境中的应用。

Method: 提出双模式优化框架：1）结构重设：用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）操作精细化：两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略，包括训练期的软剪枝（通过可学习阈值识别冗余通道）和训练后的硬剪枝（使用导出的掩码永久删除冗余通道）。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法与基线相比可实现90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，同时在感知级质量指标上超过了最先进的视频编码标准VVC。

Conclusion: 该轻量化双模式优化方法为生成式人脸视频编码在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 该方法有望克服神经模态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用，具有强大的发展潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知异常样本的先验知识，需要寻找一种不依赖异常样本训练的方法来实现真正的零样本异常检测。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1)字典构建-用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2)字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征判定为异常；3)查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的大量实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify成为一个实用简洁的基准方法，通过神经网络替代传统迭代优化，在保持准确性的同时实现了重大的效率提升，为3D人体姿势估计领域提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直观到现有引用视频对象分割方法过于关注特征提取和时序建模，而相对忽视了分割头的设计，这方面仍有很大改进空间。

Method: 提出时序条件引用视频对象分割模型，整合现有分割方法提升边界分割能力；利用文本到视频滴流模型进行特征提取，删除传统噪声预测模块以避免随机性影响；设计时序上下文掩码精细化模块(TCMR)充分利用VAE的特征提取能力。

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和创新地整合滴流模型技术，本文方法在保持模型简洁性的同时显著提升了引用视频对象分割的质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的领域适应管道，通过将晴朗天气图像转换为雾、雨、雪和夜间图像来解决自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境条件下性能显著下降，而现有数据集对恶劣条件的代表性不足，获取和标注恶劣天气数据的成本过高。

Method: 开发了多种数据生成管道，包括纯模拟、基于GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法，利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，结合模拟和真实图像进行训练，并引入自适应混合方法来减少Stable-Diffusion输出中的幻觉和伪影。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，语义分割整体性能提升1.85%，夜间条件下提升4.62%。

Conclusion: 混合方法在挑战性条件下对自动驾驶感知具有显著效果，证明了合成数据在提升恶劣天气条件下性能的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ来量化token重要性并保持序列信息流，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍有待提升。token削减是提高模型效率的有效方法，但需要针对SSM的序列建模特性进行专门设计。

Method: 提出MaMe策略：1) 利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息重要性度量；2) 引入策略性token排列来保持序列信息流；3) 适用于微调模型和现成模型。

Result: MaMe在效率和性能之间实现了优越的平衡，即使在激进的token削减下也能保持鲁棒性。在图像分类、视频和音频等多个领域都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为SSM模型提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，在保持序列建模能力的同时显著减少计算成本，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundationSSC是一个用于3D语义场景补全的新框架，通过源级和路径级的双重解耦设计，分别处理语义和几何信息，解决了现有方法在语义和几何需求冲突时的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于相机的3D语义场景补全方法使用耦合编码器同时处理语义和几何先验，这迫使模型在冲突需求之间做出权衡，限制了整体性能。

Method: 提出双重解耦设计：源级使用基础编码器分别提供语义特征先验和立体成本体积；路径级通过专门的解耦路径精炼这些先验；使用混合视图变换生成互补的3D特征；引入轴感知融合模块对各向异性融合特征。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上实现了语义和几何指标的同时提升，分别超过之前最佳结果+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU；在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到最先进性能，分别为21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU。

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双重解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何感知的冲突问题，在多个基准测试中取得了显著的性能提升，为自动驾驶和机器人导航提供了更好的密集几何和语义感知能力。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在标准数据集上进行实验，方法不仅效率高，而且精度超过之前的RGB基方法

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的视角，具有应用前景

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型中的Classifier-Free Guidance对引导权重选择非常敏感，生成质量高度依赖权重选择，存在训练与推理阶段的差距问题。

Method: 提出DiffIER方法，通过测量推理阶段的累积误差，在每个推理步骤进行迭代误差最小化来减少训练-推理差距，采用基于优化的plug-and-play框架。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了扩散模型中的训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Conclusion: OmniTry提供了一个统一的框架，成功扩展了虚拟试穿技术的应用范围，解决了多类可穿戴物品试穿的数据获取难题，具有更好的实用性能。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过混合架构实现了高效的动态图构构建，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升了路网拉取的准确性和拓扑学保真度

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM模型在图片旋转识别任务中的视觉理解能力，这需要检测旋转线索和理解空间关系的稳健视觉推理能力

Method: 构建RotBench标准化测试集（350张图片），测试多个顶尖MLLM模型在0度、90度、180度、270度旋转识别上的表现，使用辅助信息、思维链提示等方法进行改进尝试

Result: 模型在0度旋转识别表现良好，部分模型能识别180度旋转，但无法稳定区分90度和270度旋转，辅助信息和精调无法根本改善这一问题

Conclusion: MLLM模型在空间理解能力上与人类存在显著差距，尤其在区分邻近旋转角度方面表现差强，显示了当前模型的根本性限制

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Motivation: 随着多模态模型的快速发展，追求人工通用智能需要模型在多样化环境中达到人类可比性能，因此需要全面评估模型在人类相关视觉上下文的理解能力。

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两者包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；后者提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并进行主动推理。每个问题都包含人工标注的思维链推理过程。

Result: 对30多个最先进模型的广泛评估显示，模型在以人为中心的视觉理解方面面临显著挑战，特别是在详细空间感知、时间理解和心智建模任务中。Human-R分析显示模型在从多样化人类场景中提取关键主动视觉证据方面存在困难，过度依赖查询引导检索。即使使用扩展视觉上下文和测试时思考等先进技术，收益也有限。

extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

*Shumeng Li,Jian Zhang,Lei Qi,Luping Zhou,Yinghuan Shi,Yang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DCMamba框架，从数据、网络和特征三个角度增强多样性，用于半监督医学图像分割，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注成本高且耗时，半监督分割技术可以利用未标注数据生成伪标签。最新的状态空间模型（如Mamba）在处理长距离依赖方面表现出色，值得探索其在半监督医学图像分割中的应用潜力

Method: 提出多样性增强协作Mamba框架（DCMamba）：1）数据角度：开发基于Mamba扫描特性的补丁级弱-强混合增强；2）网络角度：引入多样扫描协作模块，利用不同扫描方向的预测差异；3）特征角度：采用不确定性加权对比学习机制增强特征表示多样性

Result: 实验表明DCMamba显著优于其他半监督医学图像分割方法，在Synapse数据集上使用20%标注数据时，比最新的SSM-based方法提升了6.69%

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度多样性增强，有效提升了半监督医学图像分割性能，证明了状态空间模型在该领域的应用价值

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆的新数据集AgriMuseums，并开发了分层视觉语言模型用于自然语言查询检索，在农业元宇宙场景检索任务上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教育内容日益增多但缺乏有效组织，元宇宙为教育内容提供了沉浸式交互环境，但现有数据集规模小且检索相关元宇宙场景仍具挑战性。

Method: 构建了包含文本描述的农业虚拟博物馆数据集，提出了分层视觉语言模型来表示和检索相关的AgriMuseums，支持自然语言查询。

Result: 该方法达到了62%的R@1和78%的MRR，在现有基准上提升了6% R@1和11% MRR，实验验证了设计选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 工作为农业元宇宙教育内容的组织和检索提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码已开源，有助于推动相关研究发展。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

*Yiming Cao,Yanjie Li,Kaisheng Liang,Yuni Lai,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了IPGA攻击方法，通过利用Q-Former投影器的中间层进行精细化的视觉-语言模型攻击，解决了现有方法在精细度和攻击效果上的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的目标攻击方法通过批动图像来最大化全局相似性，将丰富的视觉语义压缩成单一全局向量，限制了攻击的精细度。同时忽视了投影器模块这个视觉-语言对齐管道的关键模块，影响攻击效果。

Method: 提出IPGA攻击方法，首次利用Q-Former投影器模块的中间层进行攻击，将全局图像嵌入转换为精细化视觉特征。采用仅在第一步视觉-语言对齐阶段预训练的Q-Former，提高攻击效果和迁移性。还提出殊余查询对齐(RQA)技术保持无关视觉内容。

Result: 实验结果显示，IPGA在黑盒环境下的标准全局图像描述任务和精细化视觉问答任务中都一致超过现有方法。同时成功过渡到多个商业VLM，包括Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT。

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器模块的中间表征，实现了更精确的阻寂攻击控制，为视觉-语言模型的安全漏洞识别提供了更有效的方法。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序将所有图像除一张外都用随机噪声掩码；2）重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的方法，用于将三维形状非簧凑注册到多相机系统观测到的二维关键点。该方法通过使用广义相机模型和提出三种不同的注册方演进行解决，实现了更高的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于单影像的三维形状注册已经得到广泛研究，但多相机系统为医学成像和手持相机注册等应用领域带来了新的机遇。多视图之间的相互约束可以提供更多信息，从而提高变形形状的重建精度。

Method: 使用广义相机模型表示多相机系统，提出三种注册方法：1)关键点位于知道三维点的方向向量上；2)关键点位于未知三维点的方向向量上，但方向向量在局部坐标系中的方位知道；3)除了对应关系外，还知道对象的边缘截面。前两种方法使用凸规划求解，第三种方法使用迭代精化方法。

Result: 在多个合成和实际数据上证明了所提方法的准确性，显示出高精度的重建效果。

Conclusion: 这些方法构成了首套解决基于广义相机的三维形状注册问题的方案，为医学成像和其他应用领域提供了新的技术支撑。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提升乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，满足计算机辅助诊断的临床需求。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）和不确定性感知融合，结合BioClinicalBERT编码的BI-RADS语义临床文本，通过跨模态注意力机制实现多模态特征融合。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型，多模态对齐CLIP分数85%，置信度校准ECE 3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本显著提升了分割精度和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本对分割准确性和解释质量具有关键作用。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间步压缩攻击(TCA)框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时将攻击延迟减少了超过56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的跳变神经网络(SNN)对抗性攻击方法存在攻击延迟过大的问题，不适用于实际实时应用，需要提高攻击效率。

Method: 提出TCA框架，包含两个核心组件：1)时间步级反向传播(TLBP)使用每个时间步评估实现早期停止；2)对抗膜电位重用(A-MPR)预计算和重用初始时间步的膜电位积累阶段。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17网络上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，TCA在白盒和黑盒攻击中分别减少了56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持相当的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过分析SNN的关键特性，有效解决了现有攻击方法的延迟问题，为实际实时应用提供了可行的对抗性攻击方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定至关重要，但传统野外调查成本高、耗时，而有监督AI方法需要标签数据且跨区域沿用性差。需要一种可扩展、低成本的方法来编制城市生物多样性地图。

Method: 提出一种无监督聚类框架，集成来自街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在不需要标签数据的情况下估算生物多样性。应用于八个北美城市进行验证。

Result: 方法在属级水平上高保真度地恢复了多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数达到低Wasserstein距离，并保持了空间自相关性。证明了方法的有效性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该可扩展的细粒度方法能够为缺乏详细调查的城市制作生物多样性地图，提供了连续、低成本监测的途径，支持公平的绿化访问和城市生态系统的适应性管理。

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功实现了跨域物体检测的优异性能，为智能交通检测领域提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像模型虽然能产生视觉上令人印象深刻的结果，但在与文本提示的精确对齐方面存在困难，经常出现关键元素缺失或不同概念意外混合的问题。

Method: 学习基于目标提示的高成功率分布，在去噪过程中显式建模信号分量，提供细粒度控制以避免过优化和分布外伪影。该方法无需训练，可与现有扩散和流匹配架构无缝集成，并支持边界框等额外条件模态以增强空间对齐。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效解决文本到图像生成中的对齐问题，确保生成图像忠实反映对应的文本提示，同时保持与现有架构的良好兼容性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多依赖综合性的简化基准，隐藏了实际应用中的性能问题，需要更现实的评测标准来准确评估IL方法的真实效果。

Method: 构建了两个现实性增量学习物体检测基准RICO：D-RICO包含域迁移但类别固定，EC-RICO每步集成新域和新类别。基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和综合域、多种条件、相机传感器、视角和标注策略。

Result: 所有IL方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现差强；回放少量历史数据已能超过所有IL方法；但单独训练仍是最优解。归因于整合训练中的弱教师、单模型无法管理多样任务和不足的可塑性。

Conclusion: 现有IL方法在现实场景下表现差强，需要更有效的方法来处理域迁移、类别扩展和知识保留的挑战，新的现实性基准有助于更准确评估方法性能。

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: LCRReg是一种新的正则化方法，利用潜在概念表示来引导医学影像深度学习模型学习临床相关特征而非虚假相关性，提高模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床相关特征，导致在分布偏移下泛化能力差。需要一种方法来引导模型学习语义基础的表征。

Method: 使用小规模辅助数据集合成高质量解耦概念示例，提取预定义相关特征的潜在概念表示（如CAVs），并通过正则化项引导CNN在相关概念子空间中激活。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提高对虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可提高模型鲁棒性，优于多任务学习、线性探测等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Result: 广泛实验结果显示SCRNet连续达到最先进的图像分割性能。

Conclusion: 通过将卷积操作与交叉注意机制的智慧结合，SCRNet能同时关注长距离依赖咈局部上下文信息，为医学超声图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Motivation: 当前FIQA方法主要依赖CNN，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力未被充分探索。本文旨在利用ViT架构来提升面部图像质量评估的性能。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力处理。输出分为两个头：面部表示学习和质量分数回归。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了基于transformer架构的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA展示了transformer架构在建模面部图像效用方面的有效性，为未来FIQA研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of
packages transportation. With rising demands in the logistics sector, the
development of automated systems utilizing advanced technologies has become
increasingly crucial. Moreover, the widespread use of plastic wrapping has
motivated researchers to investigate eco-friendly alternatives that still

physical simulation system capable of replicating the behavior of moving
pallets. It features a 3D graphics-based virtual environment that supports a
wide range of configurations, including variable package layouts, different
wrapping materials, and diverse dynamic conditions. This innovative approach
reduces the need for physical testing, cutting costs and environmental impact
while improving measurement accuracy for analyzing pallet dynamics.
Additionally, we train a deep neural network to evaluate the rendered videos
generated by our simulator, as a crash-test predictor for pallet
configurations, further enhancing the system's utility in safety analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长距离感知的计算效率问题，为高速公路自动驾驶和重型卡车接入提供了可行方案

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 通过智能选择非关键帧进行补充训练，可以在在线限制下实现更高质量的3D高斯涂射模型生成

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Result: 在保持干净数据准确性的同时，达到了最先进的攻击性能，并对常见的后门防御方法表现出鲁棒性

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment是一种简单而有效的数据投毒后门攻击方法，通过显式噪声对齐显著提升了攻击效果

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single

coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Conclusion: LongSplat通过创新的联合优化框架和高效的内存管理机制，成功解决了长视频无标定NVS中的关键挑战，为大规模场景的新颖视角合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: LongSplat addresses critical challenges in novel view synthesis (NVS) from
casually captured long videos characterized by irregular camera motion, unknown
camera poses, and expansive scenes. Current methods often suffer from pose
drift, inaccurate geometry initialization, and severe memory limitations. To
address these issues, we introduce LongSplat, a robust unposed 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework featuring: (1) Incremental Joint Optimization that
concurrently optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussians to avoid local minima and
ensure global consistency; (2) a robust Pose Estimation Module leveraging
learned 3D priors; and (3) an efficient Octree Anchor Formation mechanism that
converts dense point clouds into anchors based on spatial density. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that LongSplat achieves
state-of-the-art results, substantially improving rendering quality, pose
accuracy, and computational efficiency compared to prior approaches. Project

Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解领域的子任务，探索跨模态信息交换在图表理解中的应用。

Method: 开发了基于VisualBERT的BERT-VQA模型架构，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，并可能加入联合融合模块，与基于LSTM、CNN和浅层分类器的基线模型进行对比。

Result: 最终结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT中的跨模态模块对于对齐图表组件和问题短语并非关键要素。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并为解决该问题提供了不同模型架构适用性的宝贵见解。

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了物理信息神经网络(PINNs)中训练点分布对求解微分方程精度的影响，测试了五种训练数据生成策略和浅层网络架构，发现训练点分布与微分方程特性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理信息神经网络通过将微分方程结构和给定条件直接融入损失函数来近似求解，具有网格无关性和灵活性，但其性能受多种因素影响，特别是训练点分布这一核心组件尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 使用两个常微分方程和两个偏微分方程，测试五种训练数据生成策略（包括新提出的基于正弦的分布），采用浅层网络架构（1-2个隐藏层），并通过随机和固定种子权重初始化确保结果可复现性。

Result: 研究结果显示训练点分布对解精度有显著影响，并发现训练点分布与微分方程的特性之间存在关联性。

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响物理信息神经网络性能的关键因素，其选择应与微分方程的特性相匹配，基于正弦的分布策略显示出良好的应用潜力。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Motivation: 现有的时序交互网络学习方法忽略了网络拓扑结构的影响，将其视为粗粒度的多序列预测问题，存在局限性。

Method: DGNPP模型包含节点聚合层（捕获拓扑结构生成静态表示）和自注意力层（动态更新嵌入），将动态和静态嵌入结合到事件强度函数中，通过最大似然估计进行优化。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务上实现了优越性能，显著优于基线模型，且具有高效率。

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，通过同时考虑网络拓扑结构和时间动态性，在时序交互网络学习中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RISE是一个两阶段框架，通过强化学习生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链，然后利用高质量思维链进行监督微调和强化微调，在复杂图像标注任务中超越了SFT和Visual-RFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务（如情感分类和上下文驱动的目标检测）中存在推理能力不足的问题。标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，而视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证的思维链导致推理不一致。

Method: RISE采用两阶段框架：1）Reason阶段（RISE-CoT）：通过强化学习的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础、逻辑一致的思维链；2）Inspire和Strengthen阶段（RISE-R1）：利用RISE-CoT奖励筛选的高质量思维链子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调。

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型超越了SFT和Visual-RFT方法，实现了鲁棒性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，可有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Conclusion: 本文提出的新颖方法在系统识别和反馈控制方面相比现有工作有显著改进

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Conclusion: 物理可行数据增帽在HAR领域具有显著优势，物理模拟为生成合成IMU数据提供了成本效益高的可扩展方案，有助于解决HAR领域的标注数据稀缺挑战

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

Conclusion: 协作式匹配系统能够在高风险应用领域实现人机补充性，为医疗健康和社会服务等领域提供更好的决策支持

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

Motivation: 标准共形预测将类别视为扁平且无结构的，忽略了类别标签之间的语义关系或层次结构等领域知识。

Method: 将HCC表述为一个约束优化问题，通过证明一个更小、结构良好的候选解子集足以确保覆盖并保持最优性来解决组合复杂性。

Result: 在包含音频、图像和文本数据的三个新基准测试上的实证评估显示了该方法的优势，用户研究表明标注者显著偏好层次化预测集而非扁平预测集。

Conclusion: HCC成功地将类别层次结构整合到共形预测中，在保持统计保证的同时提供了更具信息性和用户友好的预测集。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Motivation: 现有的流匹配生成方法缺乏对约束条件的有效处理能力，特别是在只能通过成员查询获取约束信息的情况下，需要开发新的约束满足生成方法。

Method: 针对可微距离函数约束，在FM目标中添加约束惩罚项；针对成员查询约束，采用随机化方法学习均值流，并提出了两阶段高效计算策略。

Conclusion: 本文提出的约束流匹配方法为约束生成问题提供了有效解决方案，特别是在只能通过查询获取约束信息的场景下具有重要价值，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

Result: 论文展示了在部分可观测性条件下语言习得问题的解决方案，证明了通过环境知识和消息推断私有信息的可行性。

Conclusion: 部分可观测性是语言习得中一个重要但常被忽视的方面，提出的学习算法能够有效解码私有信息，为更真实的语言习得场景提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

*Amirali Arbab,Zeinab Davarani,Mehran Safayani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于动态图构建和空间时间注意力机制的新框架，用于fMRI分析进行孤独症识别，在ABIDE数据集上超越了静态图方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的fMRI分析方法主要基于静态功能连通性或无法全面抓取空间时间关系，而神经活动动力学的理解对神经科学发展至关重要。

Method: 使用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断每个时间间隔的大脑功能连通性，构建时变图并用图卷积网络和transformer处理，以抓取局部交互和全局时间依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上达到了63.2%的准确率和60.0%的AUC值，显著超过静态图方法（如GCN:51.8%）。

Conclusion: 证明了动态连通性与空间时间上下文联合建模的有效性，核心新颖性在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和通过GCN-transformer融合的层次空间时间特征融合。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

Motivation: 现有MoE架构在非NVIDIA平台上性能不佳，存在显著的激活内存开销和昂贵的all-to-all通信问题，限制了模型的可扩展性。

Method: 采用无填充MoE训练、跨平台内核、冗余绕过调度和序列分片MoE块的混合并行技术。

Result: 在Frontier超级计算机（AMD MI250X GPU）上，X-MoE成功扩展到1024个GPU上的5450亿参数模型，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量。

Conclusion: X-MoE系统有效解决了MoE训练在非NVIDIA平台上的性能瓶颈，实现了下一代MoE架构的高效可扩展训练。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Motivation: 未来轨迹预测在自动驾驶、飓风预测、流行病建模等领域很重要，但现有方法生成的轨迹集合通常未经校准，缺乏可靠的置信区间

Method: 基于共形预测的统一框架，引入新颖的在线更新步骤和捕捉步间依赖关系的优化步骤，生成围绕每条轨迹的不连续预测区间

Result: 能够自然捕捉时间依赖性，产生更尖锐、更自适应的不确定性估计

Conclusion: 该方法为轨迹预测提供了理论保证的校准预测区间，改进了不确定性量化

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: J3O框架能够高效地在边缘设备上支持多任务并发推理，在保证高准确性的同时具有良好的可扩展性和运行效率

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 通过时频分析和空间相关性评估，证实鸣鸟信号可作为疾病发作起源区定位的补充方法，尤其在手术成功患者中显示高准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种定量框架来评估临床定义的疾病发作起源区（SOZ）与通过时频分析识别的统计异常通道之间的空间一致性

Method: 两步流程：(1)无监督异常检测，使用局部异常因子（LOF）分析识别异常通道；(2)空间相关性分析，计算准确匹配指标和加权指数相似性

Result: LOF方法（N邻居=20，污染度=0.2）有效检测异常通道。无疾病发作患者（指数精度均值：0.903）和手术成功患者（指数精度均值：0.865）表现最佳，而失败案例一致性较低（指数精度均值：0.460）

Conclusion: 鸣鸟基础的异常检测结合加权空间指标，为SOZ定位提供了补充方法，尤其在手术成功患者中显示出良好效果

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Conclusion: NovoMolGen为推进高效有效的分子建模策略提供了坚实的基础，在分子生成任务上建立了新的最先进结果，为分子设计领域提供了重要的方法论指导。

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Result: 算法将共享结构相关的学习复杂度从O(N)降低到次线性O(√N)，NetLinUCB在低噪声细粒度异质性场景表现优异，Net-SGD-UCB在高维高方差环境下更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 所提出的网络感知UCB算法有效解决了网络化上下文线性赌博机问题，在模拟定价环境中相比标准基准方法表现出更好的性能，实现了通信成本和学习效率的平衡。

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

TL;DR: MAVIS是一个轻量级的推理时对齐框架，通过价值引导搜索实现多目标对齐，无需修改基础模型权重即可动态控制LLM行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，计算成本高且不灵活，需要一种轻量级的推理时对齐解决方案

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型产生倾斜函数，调整基础模型的输出分布

Result: MAVIS在性能上优于为每个目标微调模型并事后组合的基线方法，甚至接近为特定用户偏好微调的理想化设置

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一种计算高效且灵活的多目标对齐方法，能够在推理时动态调整模型行为，避免昂贵的模型微调

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Motivation: 在能源和交通等关键领域，时间序列的非平稳动态与文本等多模态事件深度交织，但现有方法大多依赖单一模态，导致上下文知识有限和模型性能不足

Method: 使用自回归扩散和流匹配来捕捉时间-事件交互，根据事件语义信号自适应控制流匹配时间步，采用多模态U形扩散变换器在不同分辨率下融合时间和文本模态

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上，EventTSF在12个基线方法中表现最优，预测准确率提高10.7%，训练效率提升1.13倍

Conclusion: EventTSF通过有效整合文本事件信息，显著提升了非平稳时间序列预测的性能，为解决多模态时间序列预测问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的有向图神经网络常常无法同时抓取方向语义和全局结构模式，因为其各向同性聚合机制和局部滤波机制。

Method: 首先通过多头自注意力精炼奇异值嵌入，自适应地增强关键谱组件并压制高频噪声，实现可学习的低通/高通图滤波。然后将奇异向量作为方向投影基础，奇异值作为缩放因子，使用Transformer模型多尺度相互作用。

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图上的表示学习建立了一个新的范式，能够有效地聚合方向性信息和全局结构特征。

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

Motivation: 现实应用中机器学习模型面临在线标签偏移问题，标签分布随时间变化。传统方法需要仔细选择学习率：过低会减慢适应速度，过高会导致不稳定。

Method: 提出ASAP方法，通过计算当前和先前未标记输出的余弦距离，并将其映射到有界范围内来动态调整学习率。仅需使用先前的softmax输出，无需标签、模型集成或历史输入。

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景下的实验表明，ASAP始终能提高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ASAP为无监督模型适应提供了一种实用解决方案，能够有效处理在线标签偏移问题。

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出HCAL分类器，通过原型对比学习和自适应任务加权机制解决HMC中的结构一致性和损失平衡问题，在多个数据集上实现了更高的分类精度和更低的分层违规率。

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Motivation: 开发一个可解释的视觉化框架，用于分析chirp特征在不同临床结果中的分布模式，为临床分层和决策支持提供洞察。

Method: 使用t-SNE进行降维可视化，保留局部邻域关系并解决拥挤问题；在2D嵌入上构建三个分类任务；采用四种分类器（随机森林、SVM、逻辑回归、k-NN）进行5折交叉验证；使用SHAP生成特征影响敏感度图。

Result: 随机森林和k-NN分类器表现最佳，在最优病例检测任务中达到88.8%的准确率；SHAP图揭示了嵌入空间中空间局部化的特征重要性，显示了特定chirp属性如何驱动区域聚类和类别分离。

Conclusion: 该集成框架展示了可解释嵌入和局部特征归因在临床分层和决策支持中的潜力，为理解数据潜在结构提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

TL;DR: DyMixOp是一种新颖的神经算子框架，通过惯性流形理论将无限维非线性PDE动力学转换为有限维潜在空间，利用局部-全局混合变换有效捕捉细节和非线性相互作用，在多个PDE基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Motivation: 传统神经网络在近似非线性偏微分方程动力系统时面临格式转换困难，特别是在处理不可线性化动力学或需要无限维空间进行线性化的情况下。

Method: 基于惯性流形理论，提出局部-全局混合(LGM)变换，受湍流对流动力学启发，构建动态感知架构连接多个LGM层来近似线性和非线性动力学。

Result: 在多种PDE基准测试中实现最先进性能，显著降低预测误差（在对流主导场景中高达86.7%），同时保持计算效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: DyMixOp框架成功解决了非线性PDE动力系统的近似问题，通过理论驱动的架构设计在保持物理可解释性的同时实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂机器学习算法的不透明性问题，这是人工智能谨畏发展的主要障碍之一。需要明确区分不同类型不透明性的本质和产生原因，以便有针对性地开展解释性研究。

Method: 分析性研究方法：第一部分分析两种不透明性类型及其伦理含义：技术复杂性导致的本质不透明（如神经网络）和商业保密导致的意图不透明；第二部分评估计算机科学中发展的各种解释方法。

Result: 识别了AI系统不透明性的两种根本原因，明确了各自的特征和伦理影响。发现可解释AI（XAI）技术虽然发展过多种解释方法，但仍面临着许多重大挑战。

Conclusion: 算法不透明性是一个复杂的多维问题，需要根据不同的不透明类型采取不同的应对策略。技术不透明需要通过解释技术来充分解决，而意图不透明则需要通过法律规定和伦理约束来管理。XAI技术的发展仍有很长路要走。

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

TL;DR: 开发了MuFlex开源平台，用于多建筑灵活性协调的基准测试，通过EnergyPlus建筑模型和OpenAI Gym接口实现标准化RL实现，案例研究表明四栋办公楼聚合能有效降低峰值需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率增加，需要建筑群的协调需求灵活性。现有测试平台大多针对单栋建筑，多建筑平台有限且依赖简化模型，无法充分捕捉物理细节和中间变量，限制了作为基准测试工具的适用性。

Method: 开发MuFlex开源平台，支持EnergyPlus建筑模型的同步信息交换，遵循最新OpenAI Gym接口，提供模块化、标准化的强化学习实现。使用Soft Actor-Critic算法并精细调参，在四栋办公楼案例中进行验证。

Result: 四栋建筑灵活性聚合成功将总峰值需求降低到指定阈值以下，同时保持了室内环境质量。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台为解决多建筑灵活性协调的基准测试需求提供了有效解决方案，证明了建筑群聚合在需求响应中的可行性。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRSA是医院和长期护理机构的重要公共卫生威胁，现有预测模型缺乏流行病学可解释性且性能有限，机制性模型难以校准且无法有效整合多样化数据集

Method: 整合神经网络与机制性元种群模型，利用患者级保险索赔数据、通勤数据和医疗转移模式，学习区域和时间特异性参数来捕捉MRSA传播动态

Result: CALYPSO在州级预测性能上比机器学习基线提升超过4.5%，能够识别高风险区域和制定感染预防资源分配的成本效益策略

Conclusion: CALYPSO框架能够提供准确、可解释的多空间分辨率预测，支持感染控制政策和暴发风险的反事实分析，为公共卫生决策提供有力工具

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

### [195] [Collapsing ROC approach for risk prediction research on both common and rare variants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13552)
*Changshuai Wei,Qing Lu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的风险预测方法CROC，能够合并处理常见和稀有变异，提高疾病预测的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基因风险预测模型主要基于常见变异，预测准确性不足以满足临床需求，需要考虑稀有变异的贡献

Method: 提出CROC方法，是对FROC方法的扩展，特别添加了处理稀有变异的流程，使用533个SNP和37个候选基因进行验证

Result: 包含所有SNP的模型预测准确性更高（AUC=0.605 vs 0.585），当常见变异数量减少时CROC表现更好，在只有稀有变异的情况下CROC AUC达到0.603，而FROC仅0.524

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效处理稀有变异，显著提高风险预测的准确性，为综合考虑常见和稀有变异的风险预测提供了新的方法学框架

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上与判别式和生成式机器学习模型进行比较，证明了模型的有效性

Conclusion: GenHAI模型为医院管理者提供了强大的工具，可以回答多种重要问题来缓解MRSA感染风险

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有的自监督对比学习方法（如BYOL、Barlow Twins、SwAV）缺乏统一的理论框架，且难以在没有标签的情况下保证特征空间的类内紧凑性和类间分离性。

Method: 提出通用学习框架GLF，包含对齐部分和约束部分；设计自适应分布校准（ADC）方法，通过动态捕获样本间关系来增强类内紧凑性和类间分离性。

Conclusion: GLF框架统一了现有自监督对比学习方法，ADC方法通过增强类内紧凑性和类间分离性，显著提升了无监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

Motivation: 传统联邦学习需要统一模型架构和多轮通信，忽略了资源异构性，给客户端带来沉重计算负担和通信开销。移动网络中客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏技术，客户端仅在未标记公共数据集上交换模型预测输出而非完整模型权重。设计了专门的损失函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型，并采用定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略整合多样化知识。

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信、知识蒸馏和伪标签优化，有效解决了联邦学习中的通信开销、资源异构和隐私保护问题，为资源受限的移动网络环境提供了实用的联邦学习框架。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习率调整方法复杂且需要手动调整超参数，涉及巨大的计算开销和时间成本

Method: 基于随机二阶算法开发了一种解释性学习率调整方法，根据随机梯度的范数变化自动调整学习率（范数减小时增加，范数增大时减小）

Result: 该方法在SGD、SGDM和SIGNSGD等经典随机算法中展现了高效率、稳健性和可扩展性

Conclusion: 提出的自动化学习率调整方法简单高效，无需手动调参，在多种机器学习任务中都表现出良好性能

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 基于套幂协作机制的倍次个性化子图联邦学习框架FedSheafHN，通过套幂扩散丰富客户表征并使用超网络生成定制模型，有效解决子图异构性带来的性能差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子图联邦学习中，客户端子图数据分布异质性强，导致各客户模型性能差异显著，传统个性化方法无法有效处理这种异构性。

Method: 1）利用图级嵌入将客户局部子图嵌入服务器构建的协作图中
2）在协作图中进行套幂扩散以丰富客户表征
3）通过服务器优化的超网络生成定制化的客户模型

Result: 经验评估显示FedSheafHN在多个图数据集上超过现有个性化子图联邦学习方法，具有快速的模型收敛速度，并能有效地渗透到新客户。

Conclusion: FedSheafHN通过套幂协作机制和超网络模型生成，有效解决了子图联邦学习中的异构性问题，为个性化子图分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRAFT是一种可扩展的训练中子集选择方法，通过低秩特征表示和Fast MaxVol采样器选择多样化子集，动态调整子集大小，在保持训练轨迹的同时减少计算时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练现代神经网络在大型数据集上计算和环境成本高昂，需要开发能够减少计算时间、能耗和碳排放的高效训练方法。

Method: 提取每批数据的低秩特征表示，应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择能够覆盖批次主导子集的小型多样化子集，并使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超越了现有的选择基线方法，在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过低秩子空间操作和精心选择的训练样本，能够在保持训练性能的同时显著减少计算时间、能耗和二氧化碳排放。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了输入时间缩放范式，通过在训练和测试阶段组合元知识来精炼输入，反转了"垃圾输入垃圾输出"的假设，达到了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型主要靠数据训练缩放和推理时间缩放，本文想补充输入时间缩放来完善整体性能。

Method: 在训练和测试阶段都应用查询策略，组合LLM的元知识来精炼输入，发现训练-测试协同设计的重要性。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct模型上达到AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)的SOTA性能，多模型投票可达AIME25(80%)，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B达到AIME24(86.7%)。

Conclusion: 表面低质量数据可以获得高性能，过分精细数据可能限制性能上限，小数据集即可激活高级推理能力，"Less is More"现象在这里得到验证。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

TL;DR: 该论文将CASH框架扩展到现代ML流水线选择与适配，提出PS-PFN方法，通过后验采样和先验数据拟合网络高效探索和利用ML流水线，在基准测试中表现优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着预训练模型的发展，现代ML工作流超越了超参数优化，需要微调、集成等适配技术，传统CASH框架无法处理日益异构的ML流水线，需要新的AutoML方法。

Method: 提出PS-PFN方法，将后验采样扩展到最大k臂老虎机问题设置，利用先验数据拟合网络通过上下文学习高效估计最大值后验分布，支持不同成本和每臂独立建模。

Result: 在一个新颖和两个现有标准基准任务上的实验结果表明，PS-PFN相比其他老虎机和AutoML策略具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 成功扩展了CASH框架以适应现代ML流水线，PS-PFN方法为异构ML流水线的自动选择和适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个对抗性重尾bandit问题的通用框架，通过精心设计的奖励函数实现FTRL算法，在重尾MAB中首次实现BOBW性能，并在线性bandit中扩展到有限臂集情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注随机环境下的重尾bandit问题，对抗性环境下的研究很少且仅限于MAB特殊情况，需要开发适用于对抗性重尾bandit的通用框架。

Method: 使用跟随正则化领导者(FTRL)算法，在损失估计上添加精心设计的奖励函数，提出HT-SPM数据依赖学习率，并使用方差缩减的线性损失估计器。

Result: 在重尾MAB中实现了Õ(T^(1/ε))的最坏情况遗憾和Õ(log T)的间隙依赖遗憾；在线性bandit中获得了Õ(d^(1/2)T^(1/ε))的遗憾界，与随机环境下的最佳界匹配。

Conclusion: 提出了首个对抗性重尾bandit通用框架，在MAB和线性bandit中均实现了BOBW性能，填补了对抗性重尾bandit研究的空白。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供应链信用评估面临隐私保护、数据分散、类别不平衡、非IID数据分布和模型黑盒问题，需要一种既能保护隐私又能提供解释性的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于性能的客户端选择策略(PBCS)处理类别不平衡和非IID问题，使用增强同态加密的FedProx架构作为核心模型，集成Transformer编码器提供特征洞察，并应用集成梯度可解释AI技术。

Result: 在真实供应链数据集上的实验表明，Trans-XFed相比多个基线方法能够提供更准确的信用评估，同时保持透明度和隐私保护。

Conclusion: Trans-XFed成功解决了供应链信用评估中的多重挑战，实现了准确性、隐私保护和模型可解释性的平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DREAMS是一种新的降维方法，通过正则化项结合t-SNE的局部结构保持和PCA的全局结构保持，生成在两种方法之间的嵌入谱系，有效平衡多尺度结构保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维方法要么专注于保持局部结构（如t-SNE、UMAP），要么专注于保持全局结构（如MDS、PCA），但没有方法能够同时很好地保持数据的局部和全局结构。

Method: 通过简单的正则化项将t-SNE的局部结构保持能力与PCA的全局结构保持能力相结合，生成从局部结构良好的t-SNE嵌入到全局结构良好的PCA嵌入之间的连续谱系。

Result: 在7个真实世界数据集（包括5个单细胞转录组数据集和1个群体遗传学数据集）上进行基准测试，定性和定量结果都显示DREAMS在多尺度结构保持方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DREAMS方法成功解决了同时保持局部和全局结构的挑战，为高维数据可视化提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统老虎机算法主要关注最大化累积奖励，而夏普比率优化需要在获得高回报和控制风险之间取得平衡，这需要对均值和方差进行仔细探索。

Method: 采用Thompson Sampling贝叶斯方法，假设奖励服从未知参数的高斯分布，提出了专门针对夏普比率的遗憾分解方法，设计了SRTS算法。

Result: 理论分析表明SRTS算法实现了对数级别的遗憾上界，并推导了匹配的下界证明其阶数最优性。实证模拟显示该算法显著优于现有算法。

Conclusion: Thompson Sampling在夏普比率最大化问题上表现出色，通过专门设计的遗憾分解和信息获取机制，能够有效平衡收益和风险，实现最优性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在深度（最难问题的取样能力）和幅度（单次迭代的数据消耗量）两个维度上存在不足，限制了推理能力的发挥。GRPO算法存在系统性偏向，过度重视中等难度问题而忽视了对推进推理边界关键的低准确率问题。

Method: 1. 提出DARS（Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling）算法：通过目标多阶段滚动重新加权难题，增加难题的正向滚动数量。
2. 大幅度训练：扩大批处理量，用全批量更新替换PPO的小批量迭代，多连续时间步训练。
3. 结合DARS和大幅度的DARS-B方案。

Result: 1. DARS在不增加推理成本的情况下稳健提升Pass@K性能
2. 大幅度训练显著提升Pass@1性能
3. DARS-B同时在Pass@K和Pass@1上获得收益
4. 大批量训练保持高标志灵洞度，表明继续探索和降低梯度噪声

Conclusion: 深度和幅度是RLVR中正交的两个维度，同时优化这两者对展现RLVR的推理能力关键作用。DARS和大幅度训练的结合能够充分发挥RLVR的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在预测任务中取得了重要突破，但其在时间序列预测中的有效性仍有争议。需要重新考虑自注意力机制的重要性和明确建模周期模式的必要性。

Method: 提出周期嵌套相对注意偏置，直接捐捕周期结构。设计了分组注意力机制，每个组使用多查询注意力机制来对准特定周期性（如日度和周度周期）。

Result: 在多个基准测试集上进行了涉及广泛的实验，结果显示PENGUIN一贯地超过了基于MLP和Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了明确建模周期模式和结合相对注意偏置对时间序列建模的重要性，提供了一种简单但高效的方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

Motivation: 深度学习模型扩缩带来性能提升，但也带来挑战。联邦学习作为分布式训练框架可解决这些问题，但通信效率仍是关键瓶颈，特别是在异构和动态客户参与的情况下。现有方法对每轮选择多少客户的问题研究不够深入。

Method: 提出智能参与者选择（ISP）机制，通过动态确定每轮训练的最优客户数量来提升通信效率。该方法在多种设置下进行验证，包括视觉Transformer、实际ECG分类以及梯度压缩训练。

Result: 结果显示ISP能够一致节省达30%的通信开销，同时不丢失最终模型质量。在不同的实际ECG分类设置中应用ISP，显示了选择客户数量是联邦学习中一个独立的重要任务。

Conclusion: ISP机制通过动态选择每轮参与客户数量，有效解决了联邦学习中的通信效率问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著减少通信成本，为联邦学习的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

proposed system enables local, data-driven forwarding decisions that adapt
dynamically to congestion conditions. The system is evaluated on a
Mininet-based testbed using P4-programmable BMv2 switches, demonstrating how
our SLA-based mechanism converges to effective path selections and adapts to
shifting network conditions at line rate.

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Conclusion: 论文为实践者选择剪枝策略提供了价值较高的见解，强调需要根据具体目标和约束来选择适合的剪枝方法，而不是简单地偏好某种方法。

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP是一个轻量级的联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝恶意客户端影响的模型连接来高效消除恶意贡献，无需完全重新训练，在保持良性数据性能的同时降低恶意数据准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信且合作，但面对恶意和可能共谋的客户端时，无法假设它们会配合遗忘数据，需要新的解决方案。

Method: FedUP利用最后一轮训练中的客户端权重，识别并抑制良性客户端和恶意客户端之间差异最大的高幅度权重连接，通过精心选择和归零这些权重来隔离恶意影响。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等多种场景下，FedUP能有效降低恶意影响，将恶意数据准确率降至与从头训练模型相当的水平，同时保持良性数据性能，且比现有方法更快、更节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一个高效、鲁棒的解决方案，能够在强对抗威胁模型下有效处理恶意客户端问题，为联邦学习安全提供了实用的遗忘机制。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Motivation: 现有生物识别评估框架过时，无法反映最新技术进步和新兴漏洞，需要更可靠的评估方法

Method: 通过24位生物识别专家调查，对各模态进行评分，并与55个生物识别数据集的实验结果进行对比分析

Result: 专家评估显示各模态属性分数出现显著变化，面部识别因技术进步而提升，指纹识别因攻击漏洞而降低，专家评估与数据集实验结果高度一致

Conclusion: 专家谄查提供了可靠的生物识别模态评估，应结合实证数据与专家见解，专家分歧之处指明了未来研究方向

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

*Yishun Lu,Wesley Armour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP) 是一种新方法，通过利用两个子批次的梯度信息，在大批量训练时恢复二阶方法的有效性，提高泛化能力和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批量训练（上万个样本），但现有优化器在大批量下表现不佳。一阶方法梯度噪声减少难以逃离局部极小值，二阶方法（如KFAC）需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: FOP方法利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下构建方差感知的更新方向，通过梯度差与平均梯度正交的分量来增强平均梯度。

Result: FOP能够在大批量训练时恢复二阶方法的有效性，实现可扩展训练，具有改进的泛化性能和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: FOP技术解决了大批量训练中优化器性能下降的问题，为大规模深度学习训练提供了有效的二阶优化解决方案。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

TL;DR: OFQL改进了流行的零散Q学习方法，通过流匹配框架实现了高效的一步动作生成，在保持性能的同时大幅缩短训练和推理时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零散Q学习方法依赖多步去噪过程，导致训练和推理效率低下，而简单的一步去噪方法会导致性能大幅下降。

Method: 采用流匹配框架重构零散Q学习，学习平均速度场来支持直接的一步动作生成，避免曲线生成路径的影响。

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL表现超过零散Q学习和其他零散基线方法，同时大幅减少了训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: OFQL通过流匹配框架实现了高效的一步动作生成，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了效率，为离线强化学习提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端天气事件，给老化的合流制下水道系统带来挑战，增加未经处理废水溢流风险。现有AI预测方法依赖云计算，通信中断时可靠性受限。

Method: 集成轻量级Transformer和LSTM模型，采用整数量化压缩，通过自动化硬件感知部署管道在AMD Spartan-7 FPGA上搜索最优模型配置，联合最小化预测误差和能耗。

Result: 8位Transformer模型在24小时历史数据训练下达到MSE 0.0376的高精度，能耗0.370 mJ/推理；8位LSTM模型能耗更低(0.009 mJ)但精度下降14.89%(MSE 0.0432)，训练时间更长。

Conclusion: 需要在模型选择与部署优先级之间权衡，LSTM适合超低能耗场景，Transformer适合高精度需求。工作实现了本地化、高能效预测，增强合流制下水道系统韧性。

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub
Repository (https://github.com/tianheng-ling/EdgeOverflowForecast).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布参数化，限制了学习行为为单模态，而许多实际问题需要多模态策略来进行鲁棒探索和适应不同情境

Method: 引入分类策略，使用中间分类分布建模多模态行为模式，然后基于采样模式生成输出动作。探索了两种采样方案确保可微分离散潜在结构，同时保持高效的基于梯度的优化

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境中评估，通过更好的探索，学习策略收敛更快且优于标准高斯策略

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Result: 现有AutoFE方法普遍存在以下问题：使用困难、缺乏文档、没有活跃社区支持，且没有方法支持设置时间和内存限制

Conclusion: 本研究强调了开发更易用、设计更好的自动特征工程方法的必要性

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Conclusion: 通过揭示线性标量化权重与多任务优化指标之间的关系，提出的AutoScale框架能够有效自动选择最优权重，避免了昂贵的超参数搜索

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Conclusion: 该模型和算法为处理多用户并行互动的在线广告问题提供了有效解决方案，AUCBBP在用户规模扩展方面显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for

By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge

dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASDFormer是一个基于Transformer的架构，通过混合专家池化分类器来捕捉自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)相关的神经特征，在ABIDE数据集上实现了最先进的诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)是一种复杂的神经发育障碍，表现为大脑连接性异常。功能MRI可以测量大脑各区域的BOLD信号，这些信号可以建模为脑区之间的相互作用。有效捕捉这些连接模式并识别与典型发育不同的相互作用对于改善ASD诊断和生物标志物发现至关重要。

Method: 提出ASDFormer，一个基于Transformer的架构，整合了混合池化-分类器专家(MoE)系统。通过结合多个专门化的专家分支和注意力机制，自适应地强调与自闭症相关的不同脑区和连接模式。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集上，ASDFormer实现了最先进的诊断准确率，并揭示了与ASD相关的功能连接中断的稳健见解。

Conclusion: ASDFormer在提高分类性能的同时，能够更可解释地识别与疾病相关的生物标志物，展示了其作为生物标志物发现工具的潜力。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

### [232] [Typed Topological Structures Of Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14008)
*Wanjun Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于类型拓扑空间的新方法来分析二维数据集，通过定义特定类型的开集来研究数据集的内在结构，包括轨迹、组件和分支的组织方式，并展示了在凸包计算、聚类和异常检测等应用中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对数据集的研究主要集中于统计方法和代数拓扑方法，本文旨在从一般拓扑的角度引入类型拓扑空间的概念，为有限拓扑空间（如数据集）的研究提供新方法。

Method: 开发了一套特殊的类型集及其相关的类型拓扑结构，利用R^2的自然商空间将数据集组织成轨迹，每个轨迹被分割成有序的组件，并用整数序列表示。组件跨越轨迹形成分支，通过类型II伪树来很好地表示这些关系。

Result: 建立了一个能够揭示数据集内在结构的平台，包括轨迹组织、组件分割和分支关系的表示，为各种算法问题提供了新的解决框架。

Conclusion: 类型拓扑空间方法为数据集分析提供了新的拓扑视角，所提出的结构为凸包计算、孔洞检测、聚类和异常检测等问题的算法设计提供了有效平台。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Motivation: 满足"被忘记权"法规要求，解决完全重训练成本高的问题，并处理知识图特有结构和语义关系带来的挑战

Method: 定义知识图清除影响函数，使用Taylor展开估计数据删除导致的参数变化，利用Fisher矩阵和零阶优化近似逆-Hessian向量积，避免构建计算图

Result: 在清除效率和清除质量方面显著超过其他最先进的图清除基线方法

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效的知识图清除算法，通过数学近似技术降低了计算复杂度，为大规模知识图清除提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLIPs是一种贝叶斯学习原子间势能框架，通过变分dropout为机器学习原子间势能提供校准的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习原子间势能(MLIPs)在分布外数据和数据稀缺情况下预测准确性差，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟结果准确性。

Method: 提出BLIPs框架，基于自适应变分dropout的可扩展、架构无关的变分贝叶斯方法，可训练或微调MLIPs，兼容等变消息传递架构。

Result: 在计算化学任务中显示出比标准MLIPs更好的预测准确性，提供可信的不确定性估计，在数据稀缺和分布外情况下表现突出，微调预训练模型带来持续性能提升。

Conclusion: BLIPs框架成功解决了MLIPs的不确定性估计问题，提供了校准良好的不确定性，在数据稀缺和分布外场景下表现出色，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

TL;DR: LEOPARD算法通过结合偏好反馈和专家演示来学习奖励函数，在有限数据下显著优于现有基线方法，证明多种反馈类型组合的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中复杂任务难以指定好的奖励函数，现有方法结合偏好和演示反馈往往不够灵活或难以扩展。

Method: 提出reward-rational partial orderings框架，开发LEOPARD算法，能够从包括负面演示在内的多种人类数据中学习奖励函数。

Result: 在有限的偏好和演示反馈数据下，LEOPARD相比现有基线方法有显著优势，多种反馈类型组合通常比单一反馈类型更有效。

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活且可扩展的框架，能够有效利用多种人类反馈类型来学习奖励函数，在复杂任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.

TL;DR: 本文分析了行为观察和机制探测两种目标导向性测量方法的局限性，得出目标导向性无法客观测量的结论，并提出了多智能体动态系统中目标导向性作为涌现属性的新研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究复杂智能体行为预测的关键在于目标归因，但现有的行为观察和机制探测两种方法都存在技术和概念问题，需要重新思考目标导向性的测量方式。

Method: 通过分析行为观察法和机制探测法的基本假设，识别这两种方法在形式化智能体系统目标时的技术和概念问题。

Result: 发现目标导向性无法被客观测量，因为两种方法都存在根本性局限，无法提供可靠的目标归因。

Conclusion: 目标导向性应被视为动态多智能体系统的涌现属性，需要开发新的建模方向来更好地理解和测量这一概念。

Abstract: Our ability to predict the behavior of complex agents turns on the
attribution of goals. Probing for goal-directed behavior comes in two flavors:
Behavioral and mechanistic. The former proposes that goal-directedness can be
estimated through behavioral observation, whereas the latter attempts to probe
for goals in internal model states. We work through the assumptions behind both
approaches, identifying technical and conceptual problems that arise from
formalizing goals in agent systems. We arrive at the perhaps surprising
position that goal-directedness cannot be measured objectively. We outline new
directions for modeling goal-directedness as an emergent property of dynamic,
multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: SOAN是一个新型的结构驱动编排框架，通过识别和封装结构单元为独立代理来增量构建形式化代理网络，有效解决企业环境中复杂多层级嵌套工作流的编排挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实企业环境中的业务流程通常通过模块化和重用大量子流程组成，形成具有冗长深度嵌套执行路径的复杂工作流，这种复杂性对LLM驱动的编排提出了重大挑战，需要开发能够处理多层嵌套的可控结构编排方法。

Method: 提出自组织代理网络（SOAN）框架，通过识别和封装结构单元作为独立代理来增量构建形式化代理网络，增强编排的模块化和清晰度。

Result: 在多个基准测试和真实企业工作流数据集上的广泛评估表明，SOAN在适应性、容错性和执行效率方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SOAN框架通过结构驱动的方法有效解决了复杂企业工作流编排的挑战，为LLM驱动的多代理系统提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-agent frameworks built upon large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex task planning. However, in
real-world enterprise environments, business workflows are typically composed
through modularization and reuse of numerous subprocesses, resulting in
intricate workflows characterized by lengthy and deeply nested execution paths.
Such complexity poses significant challenges for LLM-driven orchestration, as
extended reasoning chains and state-space explosions severely impact planning
effectiveness and the proper sequencing of tool invocations. Therefore,
developing an orchestration method with controllable structures capable of
handling multi-layer nesting becomes a critical issue. To address this, we
propose a novel structure-driven orchestration framework Self-Organizing Agent
Network (SOAN). SOAN incrementally builds a formalized agent network by
identifying and encapsulating structural units as independent agents, enhancing
modularity and clarity in orchestration. Extensive evaluations were performed
using multiple benchmarks as well as a real-world enterprise workflow dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that SOAN significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of adaptability, fault tolerance, and
execution efficiency.

Motivation: 当前智能体系存在生态封闭、隐私保护、数据管理和价值评估等核心挑战，中心化或半中心化框架无法支持大规模、异构化的跨域自治交互。

Method: 提出基于区块链的BetaWeb框架，利用区块链内置优势构建可信豖、可扩展的基础设施，并提出五阶段演进路线图，从被动执行到高级协作和自治治理。

Result: 进行了现有产品的对比分析，多角度讨论了BetaWeb的关键挑战，证明区块链与LaMAS的深度集成能够为弹性、可信豖、可持续激励的数字生态系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: 区块链与LaMAS的深度集成有助于建立更健壮、可信豖的自治智能生态，推动智能体系从数据所有权向能力所有权和智力商业化转变，实现从Web3到Web3.5的演进。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are
increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based
multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain
fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for
Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an
open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still
faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value
measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from
inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,
heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these
challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic
Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not
only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has
the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data
ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and
the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the
BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,
outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration
and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing
products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.
Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay
the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized
digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is
available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.

Motivation: 大规模多智能体工作流存在错误传播和质量退化的固有脆弱性，下游智能体会放大上游故障而没有纠正机制。

Method: 采用解耦架构将错误检测与关键执行路径分离，包含三个关键算法创新：上下文回滚机制、双向反射协议和异构交叉验证。

Result: 在基准多智能体任务上实现了6.5%的平均性能改进，建立了自主工作流可靠性的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: COCO框架通过理论基础的异步监控和自适应纠错机制，有效解决了多智能体系统中的错误传播问题，在保证计算效率的同时显著提升了系统可靠性。

Abstract: Large-scale multi-agent workflows exhibit inherent vulnerability to error
propagation and quality degradation, where downstream agents compound upstream
failures without corrective mechanisms. We introduce COCO (Cognitive Operating
System with Continuous Oversight), a theoretically-grounded framework that
implements asynchronous self-monitoring and adaptive error correction in
multi-agent driven systems. COCO addresses the fundamental trade-off between
quality assurance and computational efficiency through a novel decoupled
architecture that separates error detection from the critical execution path,
achieving $O(1)$ monitoring overhead relative to workflow complexity. COCO
employs three key algorithmic innovations to address systematic and stochastic
errors: (1) Contextual Rollback Mechanism - a stateful restart protocol that
preserves execution history and error diagnostics, enabling informed
re-computation rather than naive retry; (2) Bidirectional Reflection Protocol -
a mutual validation system between monitoring and execution modules that
prevents oscillatory behavior and ensures convergence; (3) Heterogeneous
Cross-Validation - leveraging model diversity to detect systematic biases and
hallucinations through ensemble disagreement metrics. Extensive experiments on
benchmark multi-agent tasks demonstrate 6.5\% average performance improvement,
establishing new state-of-the-art for autonomous workflow reliability.

TL;DR: 本文研究多阶段图中的公平分配问题，提出C-Balance和DC-Balance算法来最小化代理间的成本嫉妒，证明其嫉妒值有界且运行效率远高于ILP方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多阶段图中，最小化总成本的最优分配可能导致代理间显著的成本差异和不公平，因此需要开发公平的分配算法来减少嫉妒。

Method: 提出C-Balance算法（针对2个代理）保证嫉妒值有界于2M，然后扩展为DC-Balance算法（针对n个代理）通过迭代调用C-Balance实现嫉妒值接近2M。

Result: C-Balance在2代理情况下嫉妒值有界于2M且紧确，公平成本比有界于2；DC-Balance可处理n代理且嫉妒值任意接近2M，实验显示运行速度比ILP快多个数量级。

Conclusion: 所提算法能有效解决多阶段图中的公平分配问题，在保证嫉妒值有界的同时维持较低的计算复杂度，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of fair assignment on Multi-Stage graphs. A
multi-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)
structured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent
stages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from
the first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient
assignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may
be highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the
agents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a
multi-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which
guarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is
the maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting
an instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness
($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair
algorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for
C-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the
DC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the
convergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.
We derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency
on the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy. We
experimentally show that our algorithm runs several orders of magnitude faster
than a suitably formulated ILP.

TL;DR: 提出了SARA中间件来解决低轨卫星网络中直播流媒体因卫星切换导致的卡顿问题，能够有效减少39.41%的缓冲时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低轨卫星网络(LSNs)虽然能填补互联网覆盖空白，但现有直播平台在卫星切换时会出现频繁的视频缓冲，现有ABR算法无法有效处理这种网络突变

Method: 开发了Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA)中间件，通过智能调节视频播放速度并为ABR算法提供LSNs特有的网络特征信息，帮助做出更好的码率选择

Result: SARA平均减少39.41%的缓冲时间，略微改善0.65%的延迟，仅带来0.13%的码率损失

Conclusion: SARA是一个轻量级且通用的中间件，能够与各种ABR算法无缝集成，显著提升LSNs上的直播流媒体体验

Abstract: Live streaming has experienced significant growth recently. Yet this rise in
popularity contrasts with the reality that a substantial segment of the global
population still lacks Internet access. The emergence of Low Earth orbit
Satellite Networks (LSNs), such as SpaceX's Starlink and Amazon's Project
Kuiper, presents a promising solution to fill this gap. Nevertheless, our
measurement study reveals that existing live streaming platforms may not be
able to deliver a smooth viewing experience on LSNs due to frequent satellite
handovers, which lead to frequent video rebuffering events. Current
state-of-the-art learning-based Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms, even when
trained on LSNs' network traces, fail to manage the abrupt network variations
associated with satellite handovers effectively. To address these challenges,
for the first time, we introduce Satellite-Aware Rate Adaptation (SARA), a
versatile and lightweight middleware that can seamlessly integrate with various
ABR algorithms to enhance the performance of live streaming over LSNs. SARA
intelligently modulates video playback speed and furnishes ABR algorithms with
insights derived from the distinctive network characteristics of LSNs, thereby
aiding ABR algorithms in making informed bitrate selections and effectively
minimizing rebuffering events that occur during satellite handovers. Our
extensive evaluation shows that SARA can effectively reduce the rebuffering
time by an average of $39.41\%$ and slightly improve latency by $0.65\%$ while
only introducing an overall loss in bitrate by $0.13\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时点云视频流在动态网络条件下的大数据量传输和丢包敏感性问题，现有TCP/QUIC协议的分段传输模式和集中控制限制了细粒度适配和有效缓存

Method: 利用点云视频的八叉树结构和表达性内容命名，支持基于消费者带宽和解码能力的渐进式增强层部分检索；结合时间窗口和帧组命名方案实现细粒度网络内缓存和多用户数据重用

Result: 原型实现显示相比最先进的DASH系统：延迟降低80%，吞吐量提高15-50%，缓存命中率提高20-30%

Conclusion: INDS是可变和丢包条件下实时点云流媒体的可扩展、缓存友好解决方案，与MoQ覆盖网络的兼容性使其成为新兴沉浸式媒体系统的实用、前向兼容架构

Abstract: Real-time streaming of point cloud video, characterized by massive data
volumes and high sensitivity to packet loss, remains a key challenge for
immersive applications under dynamic network conditions. While
connection-oriented protocols such as TCP and more modern alternatives like
QUIC alleviate some transport-layer inefficiencies, including head-of-line
blocking, they still retain a coarse-grained, segment-based delivery model and
a centralized control loop that limit fine-grained adaptation and effective
caching. We introduce INDS (Incremental Named Data Streaming), an adaptive
streaming framework based on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) that rethinks
delivery for hierarchical, layered media. INDS leverages the Octree structure
of point cloud video and expressive content naming to support progressive,
partial retrieval of enhancement layers based on consumer bandwidth and
decoding capability. By combining time-windows with Group-of-Frames (GoF),
INDS's naming scheme supports fine-grained in-network caching and facilitates
efficient multi-user data reuse. INDS can be deployed as an overlay, remaining
compatible with QUIC-based transport infrastructure as well as future
Media-over-QUIC (MoQ) architectures, without requiring changes to underlying IP
networks. Our prototype implementation shows up to 80% lower delay, 15-50%
higher throughput, and 20-30% increased cache hit rates compared to
state-of-the-art DASH-style systems. Together, these results establish INDS as
a scalable, cache-friendly solution for real-time point cloud streaming under
variable and lossy conditions, while its compatibility with MoQ overlays
further positions it as a practical, forward-compatible architecture for
emerging immersive media systems.

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports

### [244] [A Surveillance Based Interactive Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13319)
*Kshitij Kavimandan,Pooja Mangal,Devanshi Mehta*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于树莓派4的移动监控机器人系统，支持实时视频流、语音控制和多语言交互，通过YOLOv3进行对象检测和自主导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个使用普通硬件和开源软件的易于复制的移动监控机器人，支持远程监控和语音控制功能。

Method: 使用两个Raspberry Pi 4单元：前端单元负责车辆控制、摄像头和音频输入输出，中央单元负责视频流和视觉处理。通过FFmpeg传输视频，YOLOv3进行对象检测，Python语音库实现语音识别、翻译和语音合成，Kinect RGB-D传感器提供视觉输入。

Result: 在室内测试中，机器人在CPU上以交互弧率检测常见物体，可靠识别命令，并将其转换为动作而无需手动控制。

Conclusion: 该设计依靠商业硬件和开源软件，易于复制。文章讨论了系统的限制和实用扩展，包括传感器融合、GPU加速以及添加人脸和文本识别功能。

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and
responds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.
The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf
hardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and
practical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU
acceleration, and adding face and text recognition.

*Sidharth Talia,Oren Salzman,Siddhartha Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IGHA*是一种增量式广义混合A*算法，通过动态组织顶点扩展而非刚性剪枝，在复杂动力学规划中比传统HA*算法扩展次数减少6倍，实现实时性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型树搜索的高效组织问题，特别是在越野自主驾驶等实时规划应用中。传统方法在复杂动力学下构建图太慢，而HA*算法的网格分辨率选择困难

Method: 提出增量式广义混合A*（IGHA*）框架，采用动态顶点扩展组织方式，避免刚性剪枝，可证明匹配或优于HA*算法

Result: 在汽车类机器人的道路和越野规划查询中，IGHA*变体相比优化版HA*使用少6倍的扩展次数；在高保真模拟器中，IGHA*在模型预测控制循环中优于HA*M

Conclusion: IGHA*在仿真和小规模越野车辆上展示了实时性能，能够在复杂动力学下实现快速、鲁棒的规划

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于Benders分解的方法来解决双足式踏步计划中的混合整数规划问题，通过将问题分解为主问题和子问题来提高计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在双足式踏步运动中，混合整数规划(MIP)遇到非凸约束如运动学可达性和脚步旋转时，计算复杂度显著增加，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 采用Benders分解技术，将问题迭代地分解为一个主问题（用于计划原型）和一系列子问题（进行运动学和动力学可行性检查）

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比其他解决非线性约束优化问题的算法更快地完成计划

Conclusion: Benders分解方法能够有效地处理双足式踏步计划中的复杂混合整数规划问题，提高了计划效率

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了"社交小游戏"(SMGs)的概念，指机器人在受限拥挤环境中的导航挑战，并建立了首个统一的分类体系来系统化该领域的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决"最后一英里挑战"中机器人导航问题，特别是在受限拥挤环境中的多机器人导航，现有方法表现不佳且研究缺乏统一标准。

Method: 通过定义SMGs的独特特征和评估指标，建立统一的分类体系，对现有SMG求解器进行系统化分类和比较。

Result: 创建了首个SMG导航研究的系统化分类框架，为领域研究提供了标准化的比较基准和评估协议。

Conclusion: 统一的分类体系对于推进SMG导航研究至关重要，有助于建立适当的比较基准，指导未来研究方向，并降低新研究者的入门门槛。

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

Abstract: Recent advances in whole-body robot control have enabled humanoid and legged
robots to execute increasingly agile and coordinated movements. However,
standardized benchmarks for evaluating robotic athletic performance in
real-world settings and in direct comparison to humans remain scarce. We
present Switch4EAI(Switch-for-Embodied-AI), a low-cost and easily deployable
pipeline that leverages motion-sensing console games to evaluate whole-body
robot control policies. Using Just Dance on the Nintendo Switch as a
representative example, our system captures, reconstructs, and retargets
in-game choreography for robotic execution. We validate the system on a Unitree
G1 humanoid with an open-source whole-body controller, establishing a
quantitative baseline for the robot's performance against a human player. In
the paper, we discuss these results, which demonstrate the feasibility of using
commercial games platform as physically grounded benchmarks and motivate future
work to for benchmarking embodied AI.

*Catherine Glossop,William Chen,Arjun Bhorkar,Dhruv Shah,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过视觉语言模型生成假想标签，增强机器人数据集的语言基础和细粒度，从而提升视觉-语言-动作模型的指令追随能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在追随细粒化指令方面表现不佳，主要原因是机器人数据集缺乏语义多样性和语言基础，特别是类似观测下的细粒任务多样性不足

Method: 提出一种新的数据增帿方法，利用视觉语言模型为现有机器人数据集创建假想标签，通过生成假想语言和动作来增加语言基础的多样性和细粒度

Result: 在3种不同的室内外环境中进行视视语言导航实验，证明假想重标注在不需额外数据收集的情况下显著提升了VLA策略的指令追随能力，在导航任务上成功率提高27%，达到了领先方法的水平

Conclusion: 假想标签方法能够有效提升视觉-语言-动作模型的语言指令追随能力，为构建更好的通用机器人系统提供了有效的数据增帿方案

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing
success rate by 27% on navigation tasks.

*Xu Yang,Jun Ni,Hengyang Feng,Feiyu Wang,Tiezhen Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于新的转向半径角和侧滑角表示法，为全轮全向独立转向车达开发了一种筛波管基线性时变MPC控制策略，能够同时精确跟踪位置和任意航向角，具有强镀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全轮全向独立转向车达(AWOISV)能够进行偏航、对角线移动等特殊机动，但现有控制方法难以实现位置和航向角的同时精确控制，且缺乏对模型不确定性的镀性。

Method: 提出理论转向半径角和侧滑角(θ_R-β_R)表示法，建立了以前进速度v、侧滑角β、航向角速度r为状态，以θ_R和β_R为控制输入的广义动态模型。设计了筛波管基线性时变MPC(FT-LTVMPC)控制策略。

Result: 通过协同模拟和硬件在环(HIL)实验验证，FT-LTVMPC能够实现位置和航向角的高精度同时跟踪控制，并保证优秀的实时性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为AWOISV提供了一种有效的控制方案，能够在各种运动模式下实现平滑转换，并具有强镀性和实时性能，为车达控制领域提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRI研究社区虽然强调社会情境的重要性，但对"社会情境"这一术语的使用存在不一致，导致研究之间难以建立联系和比较，需要统一的概念框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过文献调查梳理HRI领域中"社会情境"的现有定义和使用方式，然后提出一个概念模型来描述人机交互的社会情境，并将该模型应用于现有研究工作。

Result: 建立了一个统一的社会情境概念模型，识别了一系列社会情境属性，这些属性可以帮助研究人员规划交互、开发机器人行为模型以及从已发生的交互中获得洞察。

Conclusion: 提出了一个有助于统一HRI领域社会情境理解的概念框架，并讨论了在理解和建模人机交互社会情境方面存在的开放性研究问题。

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROVER是一种利用历史轨迹作为先验约束来验证闭环检测的方法，特别针对重复环境中的误检测问题，通过轨迹优化和评分机制来拒绝错误闭环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在SLAM系统中，闭环检测错误可能导致严重后果，特别是在重复性环境中，基于外观的特征容易失效。现有方法主要关注学习不变的外观特征，而忽略了机器人的时空运动轨迹这一重要先验知识。

Method: 提出ROVER方法：对于每个闭环候选，首先通过位姿图优化估计机器人轨迹，然后将该轨迹提交给评分方案，评估其与无闭环时的轨迹先验的符合程度，从而决定是否接受该闭环候选。

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 利用历史轨迹作为先验约束是验证闭环检测的有效方法，特别是在具有挑战性的重复环境中能够显著减少误检测。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模块化操纵机器人在不同形态下的控制问题，避免控制器的深度参数调整

Method: 采用两层MPC结构：高层MPC预测未来状态和提供轨迹信息，低层MPC利用这些信息更新预测模型并精细控制动作，包含二次线性化技术

Result: 在不同操纵机器形态下进行了广泛评估，并在实际场景中演示了拍放任务的执行

Conclusion: H-MPC方法能够在保持线性控制模型简洁性的同时，提高运动学表示的精确性，从而提升整体控制精度和可靠性

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

Conclusion: 利用MimicFunc的一次性泛化能力，生成的轨迹可用于训练视觉运动策略，无需为新颖对象收集劳动密集型的遥操作数据

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间的普及，需要开发能够提高透明度、降低风险的沟通策略。当前研究对分心行人在机器人身边的行为研究较少。

Method: 在现场设置中，视频记录了N=498名未知情的行人穿过两个自主清扫机器人时的行为。约8%行人使用手机分心。比较了不同机器类型和运动模式的影响。

Result: 分心和未分心行人在机器人身边的移动行为没有显著差异。更大的扫地机器人和偏移矩形运动模式导致更多的侧向调整。偏移矩形模式也导致更多近距离侧向调整。

Conclusion: 研究为公共空间中行人与自主清扫机器人交互行为提供了初步见解，对HRI研究领域有所贡献。机器人的物理特征和运动模式比行人是否分心更重要。

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四旋翼非线性动力学导致的控制复杂性问题，提高轨迹跟踪精度和减少计算时间

Method: 练习深度Koopman算子构建高维潜在表示，在线性空间中应用MPC优化控制动作

Result: 在轨迹跟踪和点稳定实验中表现优异，跟踪精度更高、计算时间显著降低

Conclusion: Koopman基础学习方法能够处理复杂四旋翼动力学，满足嵌入式飞行控制实时要求

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出SGDT框架，结合神经符号规划器和目标条件决策变换器，解决多机器人协作任务中的复杂动态和长期依赖问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在机器人操作中数据密集且依赖MDP假设，难以处理复杂动态和长期依赖；决策变换器在多机器人操作中应用不足

Method: 神经符号规划器生成符号子目标的高层规划，目标条件决策变换器进行低层序列决策的层次化架构

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景中评估SGDT性能，是多机器人操作中首个基于决策变换器的技术探索

Conclusion: SGDT框架实现了结构化、可解释和可泛化的多机器人协作决策，为复杂多机器人操作任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

Motivation: 现有驾驶风格识别系统过度依赖低级传感器特征，忽略了人类专家的语义推理能力，导致算法分类与专家判断之间存在根本性不一致

Method: 1) 开发DriBehavGPT模块生成自然语言行为描述；2) 通过文本嵌入和降维转换为机器学习可处理表示；3) 作为特权信息整合到SVM+中进行训练

Result: 在真实驾驶场景中，F1分数提升7.6%(跟车)和7.9%(换道)，且推理阶段仅需传感器数据，计算效率高

Conclusion: 语义行为表征在提高识别准确性和推进可解释、以人为本的驾驶系统中发挥关键作用

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Abstract: Embodied AI (EAI) agents continuously interact with the physical world,
generating vast, heterogeneous multimodal data streams that traditional

systematically evaluate five storage architectures (Graph Databases,
Multi-Model Databases, Data Lakes, Vector Databases, and Time-Series
Databases), focusing on their suitability for addressing EAI's core
requirements, including physical grounding, low-latency access, and dynamic
scalability. We then analyze five retrieval paradigms (Fusion Strategy-Based

Abstract: Due to high-mix-low-volume production, sheet-metal workshops today are
challenged by small series and varying orders. As standard automation solutions
tend to fall short, SMEs resort to repetitive manual labour impacting
production costs and leading to tech-skilled workforces not being used to their

including 3D object recognition and localisation. This article explores both
the opportunities and challenges of enhancing cobotic systems with these
technologies in an industrial setting, outlining the key steps involved in the
process. Additionally, insights from a past project, carried out by the ACRO
research unit in collaboration with an industrial partner, serves as a concrete
implementation example throughout.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI中的"看到-行动差距"问题，该问题源于数据稀缺和具身异构性，需要一种统一的、与具身无关的中间表示来桥接高级视觉语言理解和低级动作原语。

Method: 提出"指向"作为统一的中间表示，定义四种核心具身指向能力；构建大规模数据集Embodied-Points-200K；设计Embodied-R1模型并采用两阶段强化微调(RFT)课程训练，使用专门的多任务奖励设计。

Result: 在11个具身空间和指向基准测试中达到最先进性能；零样本泛化方面，在SIMPLEREnv中达到56.2%成功率，在8个真实世界XArm任务中达到87.5%成功率，比强基线提升62%；对多样化视觉干扰表现出高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 指向中心的表示方法结合RFT训练范式，为解决机器人感知-行动差距提供了一条有效且可泛化的途径。

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在动态物体操纵中使用少量示范实现强大的泛化能力，提出了基于熵的理论框架和GEM系统，在真实应用中达到了超10,000次操作且成功率超过97%的突出表现。


<details>

Motivation: 动态物体操纵的泛化能力对提高制造业效率至关重要，但传统方法需要大量示范数据，而示范收集非常耗时耗力。本文主要解决如何在只有少量示范的情况下实现强大的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种基于熵的理论框架来量化模仿学习的优化过程，并基于这个框架开发了一个名为GEM（Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation）的系统。

Result: 在模拟和真实任务中进行了大量实验，验证了GEM系统能够在多样的环境背景、机器人体置、运动动力学和物体几何形状下都能实现良好的泛化。特别是在真实餐厅桌具收集场景中，在没有任何场景内示范的情况下，达到了超10,000次操作且成功率超过97%的突出性能。

Conclusion: 证明了通过基于熵的理论框架和GEM系统，可以在动态物体操纵中使用少量示范实现强大的泛化能力，为制造业提高效率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.

TL;DR: 通过在中等规模小提琴数据集上从头开始训练，可以达到与基于钢琴预训练模型细调相竞争或更优的小提琴自动音乐转记性能，显示了专门数据采集的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小提琴自动音乐转记（AMT）因缺乏大规模注释数据而发展迟缓，常见方法是将钢琴预训练模型进行细调，但在音色和发音方式存在差异的情况下，这种迁移学习的有效性不明。

Method: 采用钢琴转记架构不做任何修改，在MOSA数据集（约30小时对齐小提琴录音）上从头开始训练，并在URMP和Bach10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 在URMP和Bach10数据集上，从头训练的模型达到了与细调钢琴预训练模型相竞争或更优的性能。

Conclusion: 强大的小提琴AMT可以不依赖钢琴预训练表征，强调了专门为特定乐器收集和扩充数据的重要性。

Abstract: Automatic music transcription (AMT) has achieved remarkable progress for
instruments such as the piano, largely due to the availability of large-scale,
high-quality datasets. In contrast, violin AMT remains underexplored due to
limited annotated data. A common approach is to fine-tune pretrained models for
other downstream tasks, but the effectiveness of such transfer remains unclear
in the presence of timbral and articulatory differences. In this work, we
investigate whether training from scratch on a medium-scale violin dataset can
match the performance of fine-tuned piano-pretrained models. We adopt a piano
transcription architecture without modification and train it on the MOSA
dataset, which contains about 30 hours of aligned violin recordings. Our
experiments on URMP and Bach10 show that models trained from scratch achieved
competitive or even superior performance compared to fine-tuned counterparts.
These findings suggest that strong violin AMT is possible without relying on
pretrained piano representations, highlighting the importance of
instrument-specific data collection and augmentation strategies.

Motivation: 现有的Mamba语音增强模型如SEMamba仅限于单说话人场景，在复杂的多说话人环境（如鸡尾酒会问题）中表现不佳，需要视觉信息来辅助目标语音提取。

Method: 提出AVSEMamba模型，将全脸视觉线索与基于Mamba的时间骨干网络相结合，利用时空视觉信息在复杂条件下更准确地提取目标语音。

Result: 在AVSEC-4挑战赛开发和盲测集上，AVSEMamba在语音清晰度（STOI）、感知质量（PESQ）和非侵入式质量（UTMOS）方面均优于其他单声道基线方法。

Conclusion: AVSEMamba成功解决了多说话人环境下的语音增强问题，通过音频-视觉融合方法显著提升了性能，证明了视觉信息在复杂语音分离任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based models have shown promise in speech enhancement by
efficiently modeling long-range temporal dependencies. However, models like
Speech Enhancement Mamba (SEMamba) remain limited to single-speaker scenarios
and struggle in complex multi-speaker environments such as the cocktail party
problem. To overcome this, we introduce AVSEMamba, an audio-visual speech
enhancement model that integrates full-face visual cues with a Mamba-based
temporal backbone. By leveraging spatiotemporal visual information, AVSEMamba
enables more accurate extraction of target speech in challenging conditions.
Evaluated on the AVSEC-4 Challenge development and blind test sets, AVSEMamba
outperforms other monaural baselines in speech intelligibility (STOI),
perceptual quality (PESQ), and non-intrusive quality (UTMOS), and achieves
\textbf{1st place} on the monaural leaderboard.

Result: 在AudioCondition、DESED和AudioTime数据集上的广泛实验表明，DegDiT在各种客观和主观评估指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DegDiT框架通过动态事件图引导和共识优化，成功解决了可控音频生成中的关键挑战，实现了高质量、多样化的音频合成。

Abstract: Controllable text-to-audio generation aims to synthesize audio from textual
descriptions while satisfying user-specified constraints, including event
types, temporal sequences, and onset and offset timestamps. This enables
precise control over both the content and temporal structure of the generated
audio. Despite recent progress, existing methods still face inherent trade-offs
among accurate temporal localization, open-vocabulary scalability, and
practical efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose DegDiT, a novel
dynamic event graph-guided diffusion transformer framework for open-vocabulary
controllable audio generation. DegDiT encodes the events in the description as
structured dynamic graphs. The nodes in each graph are designed to represent
three aspects: semantic features, temporal attributes, and inter-event
connections. A graph transformer is employed to integrate these nodes and
produce contextualized event embeddings that serve as guidance for the
diffusion model. To ensure high-quality and diverse training data, we introduce
a quality-balanced data selection pipeline that combines hierarchical event
annotation with multi-criteria quality scoring, resulting in a curated dataset
with semantic diversity. Furthermore, we present consensus preference
optimization, facilitating audio generation through consensus among multiple
reward signals. Extensive experiments on AudioCondition, DESED, and AudioTime
datasets demonstrate that DegDiT achieves state-of-the-art performances across
a variety of objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

Method: 使用三种互补的错误率指标：等错误率(EER)、积累匹配特征命中率(CMC)、以及通过典型相关分析和Procrustes分析测量嵌入空间相似度

Result: 所有领先语音去识别系统都存在身份泄漏，性能最好的系统仅略强于随机猜测，最差的系统在CMC前50名候选人中达到45%的命中率

Conclusion: 当前语音去识别技术仍存在持续的隐私风险，需要更有效的方案来保护记者身份信息

Abstract: Speaker de-identification aims to conceal a speaker's identity while
preserving intelligibility of the underlying speech. We introduce a benchmark
that quantifies residual identity leakage with three complementary error rates:
equal error rate, cumulative match characteristic hit rate, and embedding-space
similarity measured via canonical correlation analysis and Procrustes analysis.
Evaluation results reveal that all state-of-the-art speaker de-identification
systems leak identity information. The highest performing system in our
evaluation performs only slightly better than random guessing, while the lowest
performing system achieves a 45% hit rate within the top 50 candidates based on
CMC. These findings highlight persistent privacy risks in current speaker
de-identification technologies.

Abstract: Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are essential for medical
training, but they require significant resources, including professional actors
and expert medical feedback. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have
introduced text-based virtual patients for communication practice, these
simulations often lack the capability for richer, non-textual interactions.
This paper presents a novel framework that significantly enhances LLM-based
simulated patients by equipping them with action spaces, thereby enabling more
realistic and dynamic patient behaviors that extend beyond text. Furthermore,
our system incorporates virtual tutors that provide students with instant,
personalized feedback on their performance at any time during these simulated
encounters. We have conducted a rigorous evaluation of the framework's
real-time performance, including system latency and component accuracy.
Preliminary evaluations with medical experts assessed the naturalness and
coherence of the simulated patients, as well as the usefulness and
appropriateness of the virtual tutor's assessments. This innovative system
provides medical students with a low-cost, accessible platform for personalized
OSCE preparation at home.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require sophisticated prompting, yet current
practices face challenges in structure, data integration, format sensitivity,
and tooling. Existing methods lack comprehensive solutions for organizing
complex prompts involving diverse data types (documents, tables, images) or
managing presentation variations systematically. To address these gaps, we
introduce POML (Prompt Orchestration Markup Language). POML employs
component-based markup for logical structure (roles, tasks, examples),
specialized tags for seamless data integration, and a CSS-like styling system
to decouple content from presentation, reducing formatting sensitivity. It
includes templating for dynamic prompts and a comprehensive developer toolkit
(IDE support, SDKs) to improve version control and collaboration. We validate
POML through two case studies demonstrating its impact on complex application
integration (PomLink) and accuracy performance (TableQA), as well as a user
study assessing its effectiveness in real-world development scenarios.

TL;DR: 这篇论文设计了一个基于大语言模型的模块，用于教育中学生提示词语语能力，通过两轮现场教学部署验证了教学效果和自动评分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人工智能日益深入生活，K-12教育对教育学生谨慎有效使用AI的需求日益严峻，需要培养下一代负责任使用AI系统的能力。

Method: 设计LLM基础的提示词语语能力教学模块，包含情境化的精心练习活动和与智能语音助手直接互动。在11个真实中学教室进行了两轮部署实验。

Result: AI自动评分系统能够满意地评价学生编写的提示词；教学资源支持学生通过练习提升提示词技能，并导致学生对使用AI学习的观念发生积极变化；真/假题和开放式题比多选题更有效地测量提示词语语能力。

Conclusion: 这些结果显示了该教学模块的潜力，需要更广泛的部署和研究来评估学习效果和评估设计。

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to
apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly.
Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach
students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this
need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting
literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with
direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary
school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two
iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education
classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students'
prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and
3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the
AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory
quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in
improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in
their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1
informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and
discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could
measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for
our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for
broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess
learning effectiveness and assessment design.

### [273] [A Screw Approach to the Approximation of the Local Geometry of the Configuration Space and of the set of Configurations of Certain Rank of Lower Pair Linkages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13802)
*Andreas Mueller*

Main category: math.DG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高阶泰勒展开的多环连杆机构局部移动性分析方法，通过关节螺旋的递归代数表达式来近似构型空间和约束奇点集，能够处理传统方法无法分析的尖点等奇异情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高阶移动性分析方法基于环路闭合约束的时间导数，隐含假设所有运动都是光滑的，这种连续性假设限制了方法的通用性，无法处理某些奇异构型。

Method: 基于几何约束映射的高阶泰勒级数展开，提出了关节螺旋的递归代数表达式，给出了雅可比矩阵子式微分的显式表达式，通过机构的螺旋系统代数确定代数簇来局部近似构型空间和特定秩点集。

Result: 方法成功应用于平面四杆机构（表现出分岔奇点）和平面三环机构（构型空间中存在尖点），后者是文献中现有高阶局部分析方法无法处理的案例。

Conclusion: 提出的高阶局部移动性分析方法能够更全面地分析多环连杆机构的局部运动特性，特别是能够处理传统方法无法分析的复杂奇异构型，为机构运动学分析提供了更强大的工具。

Abstract: A motion of a mechanism is a curve in its configuration space (c-space).
Singularities of the c-space are kinematic singularities of the mechanism. Any
mobility analysis of a particular mechanism amounts to investigating the
c-space geometry at a given configuration. A higher-order analysis is necessary
to determine the finite mobility. To this end, past research lead to approaches
using higher-order time derivatives of loop closure constraints assuming
(implicitly) that all possible motions are smooth. This continuity assumption
limits the generality of these methods. In this paper an approach to the
higher-order local mobility analysis of lower pair multi-loop linkages is
presented. This is based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the
geometric constraint mapping, for which a recursive algebraic expression in
terms of joint screws is presented. An exhaustive local analysis includes
analysis of the set of constraint singularities (configurations where the
constraint Jacobian has certain corank). A local approximation of the set of
configurations with certain rank is presented, along with an explicit
expression for the differentials of Jacobian minors in terms of instantaneous
joint screws. The c-space and the set of points of certain corank are therewith
locally approximated by an algebraic variety determined algebraically from the
mechanism's screw system. Results are shown for a simple planar 4-bar linkage,
which exhibits a bifurcation singularity, and for a planar three-loop linkage
exhibiting a cusp in c-space. The latter cannot be treated by the higher-order
local analysis methods proposed in the literature.

TL;DR: 通过三阶段框架TaoSR1，直接部署LLM进行查询-产品相关性预测，解决CoT错误累积、判别性幻觉和部署可行性挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务搜索中的查询-产品相关性预测是核心任务。BERT模型缺乏复杂推理能力，而现有LLM部署方案多使用判别微调或短粒度，需要直接部署LLM的方案

Method: TaoSR1三阶段框架：(1)SFT配合CoT深入推理能力；(2)离线采样组合pass@N策略和DPO提升生成质量；(3)基于难度的动态采样组合GRPO减少判别性幻觉。添加后置CoT处理和累积概率分区方法支持高效在线部署

Result: 在离线数据集上显著超过基线模型，在在线人工评估中获得了实质性提升

Conclusion: TaoSR1为将CoT推理应用于相关性分类任务提供了新的范式，有效解决了LLM直接部署的关键挑战

Abstract: Query-product relevance prediction is a core task in e-commerce search.
BERT-based models excel at semantic matching but lack complex reasoning
capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored, most still use
discriminative fine-tuning or distill to smaller models for deployment. We
propose a framework to directly deploy LLMs for this task, addressing key
challenges: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) error accumulation, discriminative
hallucination, and deployment feasibility. Our framework, TaoSR1, involves
three stages: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with CoT to instill reasoning;
(2) Offline sampling with a pass@N strategy and Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) to improve generation quality; and (3) Difficulty-based dynamic sampling
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to mitigate discriminative
hallucination. Additionally, post-CoT processing and a cumulative
probability-based partitioning method enable efficient online deployment.
TaoSR1 significantly outperforms baselines on offline datasets and achieves
substantial gains in online side-by-side human evaluations, introducing a novel
paradigm for applying CoT reasoning to relevance classification.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: L3AE首次将大语言模型集成到线性自编码器框架中，通过两阶段优化策略有效整合文本语义和用户-物品交互的异构知识，在推荐系统性能上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性自编码器在整合文本信息时依赖稀疏的词共现模式，无法充分捕捉丰富的文本语义信息，限制了推荐系统的性能提升。

Method: 提出L3AE框架：1）从LLM生成的物品表示构建语义物品相关性矩阵；2）从协同信号学习物品权重矩阵，同时将语义相关性作为正则化项。采用闭式解优化确保全局最优和计算效率。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，L3AE相比最先进的LLM增强模型，Recall@20提升27.6%，NDCG@20提升39.3%。

Conclusion: L3AE成功将LLM集成到线性自编码器框架中，通过有效整合文本语义和协同信号，显著提升了推荐系统的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

*Yaying Luo,Hui Fang,Zhu Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CT-CRS是一个基于消费者类型理论的对话推荐系统框架，通过实时推断用户决策风格和知识水平，动态调整推荐策略，显著提高了推荐成功率和交互效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统大多忽视了用户异质性的决策风格和知识水平，这限制了系统的准确性和效率。需要一种能够识别并适应不同用户类型的方法来提升个性化服务。

Method: 基于消费者类型理论定义四类用户（依赖型、效率型、谨慎型、专家型），利用交互历史和微调大语言模型实时推断用户类型，设计类型自适应策略动态调整推荐粒度、多样性和属性查询复杂度，并采用逆强化学习优化对话策略。

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp数据集上的实验表明，CT-CRS相比强基线方法提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互轮次。消融研究证实消费者类型建模和逆强化学习都对性能提升有显著贡献。

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过整合心理建模和先进策略优化，为增强对话推荐系统的个性化提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案，证明了考虑用户异质性的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

TL;DR: AdaptJobRec是一个对话式职位推荐系统，通过自主代理整合个性化推荐算法工具，根据查询复杂度采用不同处理机制，在降低53.3%响应延迟的同时提高推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话推荐系统在处理复杂查询时存在显著响应延迟问题，需要在处理复杂查询和最小化延迟之间找到平衡。

Method: 系统采用用户查询复杂度识别机制：简单查询直接选择工具快速响应；复杂查询通过记忆处理模块过滤聊天历史，传递给智能任务分解规划器，最后使用个性化推荐工具执行任务。

Result: 在沃尔玛真实职业推荐场景评估中，相比竞争基线平均响应延迟降低53.3%，同时显著提高推荐准确性。

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec成功解决了对话推荐系统中响应延迟与处理复杂查询能力的平衡问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了HeteroIR和HeteroIM两个模型，解决了用户推荐系统中交互意愿与信息传播能力的平衡问题，在实际部署中获得了显著的效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法只关注用户交互意愿，而传播最大化方法只关注信息传播能力，两者都存在偏料。需要一种方法来平衡这两个重要因素。

Method: HeteroIR采用两阶段框架估计传播利益；HeteroIM通过反向可达（RR）集进行增量式选择和重排名，RR集表示能够通过传播到达目标的节点集合。

Result: 实验结果显示HeteroIR和HeteroIM在p-value < 0.05的统计显著性水平上显著超过最先进基线方法。在腾讯游戏平台的在线A/B测试中，分别获得8.5%和10%的效果提升。

Conclusion: 这两个模型有效地结合了用户交互意愿和信息传播能力，为用户推荐系统提供了更全面的解决方案，并在实际应用中验证了其效果。

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

TL;DR: 传统推荐系统存在忽略用户次要偏好领域的问题，校准推荐系统通过保证推荐列表中包含较少代表性领域来解决这个问题，使用三维分布结构并在电影数据集上验证了异常检测模型的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统生成的推荐列表往往只包含用户主要偏好领域的相似物品，忽略了用户次要偏好领域，这会损害用户体验。需要一种能够保证推荐列表包含较少代表性领域的推荐方法。

Method: 提出校准推荐系统，使用三个G维分布（用户档案分布、候选物品分布、推荐列表分布），实现15个模型来分析这些分布的结构，并在三个电影数据集上评估用户模式。

Result: 异常检测模型能够更好地理解分布结构，校准系统创建的推荐列表与传统推荐列表表现相似，但允许用户以相同程度改变其偏好组。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统通过多维分布分析有效解决了传统推荐系统忽略用户次要偏好的问题，异常检测模型为理解推荐分布结构提供了更好的方法。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

TL;DR: UniECS是一个统一的多模态电商搜索框架，通过门控多模态编码器和自适应融合机制处理图像、文本及其组合的所有检索场景，在多个基准测试和实际部署中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商多模态检索系统存在两个主要局限：针对特定任务优化且模态配对固定，缺乏统一的检索方法评估基准。

Method: 提出灵活架构：1）新颖的门控多模态编码器，使用自适应融合机制集成不同模态表示并处理缺失模态；2）综合训练策略，结合跨模态对齐损失、局部对齐损失、模态内对比损失和自适应损失加权；3）创建M-BEER基准数据集。

Result: 在四个电商基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在M-BEER基准上跨模态任务提升显著（文本到图像检索R@10提升28%），参数效率高（0.2B参数）。在快手电商平台部署后，点击率提升2.74%，收入提升8.33%。

Conclusion: UniECS在实验和实际环境中都证明了其有效性，为电商多模态检索提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: 该研究为合成查询生成提供了可复现的框架和有效的扩展方法，能够提高生成数据质量和检索系统性能，所有代码和数据都已开源发布。

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a

InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need
for aggressive filtering while improving retrieval performance. All code,

Conclusion: 这项工作为折纸受听元材料中编程复杂机械能量景观建立了一条多用途的、无需数据的路径，为可部署航空航天系统、变形结构和软体机器人执行器提供了广阔潜力

Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating
lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses.
However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics,
multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we
present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward
prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without
requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium
equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete
energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts.
The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and
separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy
curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where
sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier
magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes
validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the
robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route
for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired
metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems,
morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.

Motivation: MPC在自动驾驶车辆轨迹跟踪中面临计算需求高和实现复杂度大的挑战，阻碍了其在工业量产车辆中的集成应用。

Method: 基于鲁棒化的主动集非线性MPC算法，构建车辆轨迹跟踪框架，支持自动代码生成产生静态内存分配的高效C代码，可定制车辆模型和数值积分方法。

Result: 仿真场景验证了AutoMPC代码的通用性和有效性，保证可行解、高度鲁棒性和计算效率，适用于低速、高速甚至漂移等多种驾驶场景。

Conclusion: AutoMPC成功解决了MPC工业化的两大核心挑战，为嵌入式平台提供了易于部署的高效MPC解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful technique to control nonlinear,
multi-input multi-output systems subject to input and state constraints. It is
now a standard tool for trajectory tracking control of automated vehicles. As
such it has been used in many research and development projects. However, MPC
faces several challenges to be integrated into industrial production vehicles.
The most important ones are its high computational demands and the complexity
of implementation. The software packages AutoMPC aims to address both of these
challenges. It builds on a robustified version of an active set algorithm for
Nonlinear MPC. The algorithm is embedded into a framework for vehicle
trajectory tracking, which makes it easy to used, yet highly customizable.
Automatic code generation transforms the selections into a standalone,
computationally efficient C-code file with static memory allocation. As such it
can be readily deployed on a wide range of embedded platforms, e.g., based on
Matlab/Simulink or Robot Operating System (ROS). Compared to a previous version
of the code, the vehicle model and the numerical integration method can be
manually specified, besides basic algorithm parameters. All of this information
and all specifications are directly baked into the generated C-code. The
algorithm is suitable driving scenarios at low or high speeds, even drifting,
and supports direction changes. Multiple simulation scenarios show the
versatility and effectiveness of the AutoMPC code, with the guarantee of a
feasible solution, a high degree of robustness, and computational efficiency.

distributed optimization problems, where each agent aims to optimize their
parameters to maximize a coupled reward function subject to coupled
constraints. Prior work either studies a centralized setting, does not consider
safety, or struggles with sample efficiency. Since we require sample efficiency
and work with unknown and nonconvex rewards and constraints, we solve this
optimization problem using safe Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process
regression. Moreover, we consider nearest-neighbor communication between the
agents. To capture the behavior of non-neighboring agents, we reformulate the
static global optimization problem as a time-varying local optimization problem
for each agent, essentially introducing time as a latent variable. To this end,
we propose a custom spatio-temporal kernel to integrate prior knowledge. We
show the successful deployment of our algorithm in simulations.

Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking
community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box
detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior
density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.
The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,
including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected
from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,
in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting
PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and
the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the
problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better
model-based algorithms in future developments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的公平分配机制，用于解决协作学习中数据可无限复制带来的公平性问题，确保参与者之间的互惠公平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作学习等AI代理系统中，数据模型可以无限复制，传统合作博弈论（如Shapley值）无法处理这种情况，需要新的公平性定义来防止战略利用和不公平分配。

Method: 通过提出新的公平公理（平衡互惠公理）并设计具体机制，确保每对参与者都能从对方的参与中获得同等收益。

Result: 提出了一个满足互惠公平性的机制，并给出了数学证明。

Conclusion: 该机制为可复制资源场景下的公平分配提供了理论基础，解决了传统博弈论在AI协作系统中的局限性。

Abstract: The latest developments in AI focus on agentic systems where artificial and
human agents cooperate to realize global goals. An example is collaborative
learning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual
agents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and
alignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon
achieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions
of cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each
coalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation
can be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete
mechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley
value, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it
assumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.
Infinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized
through new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal
benefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and
unfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a
proof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the
Balanced Reciprocity Axiom. It ensures that, for every pair of players, each
benefits equally from the participation of the other.

Abstract: In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as
databases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are
increasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave
behind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when
effectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,
supporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric
applications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements
(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log
usage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently
consolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log
usage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More
than 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do
different types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?
(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and
non-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey
reveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of
standardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared
structural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing
knowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey
provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log
usage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly
regarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.

Conclusion: PC-GRN框架推进了基因调控网络的预测建模和系统级分析能力

Abstract: Understanding the complex and stochastic nature of Gene Regulatory Networks
(GRNs) remains a central challenge in systems biology. Existing modeling
paradigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor
regulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network
structure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the
Probabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical
approach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.
Firstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and
composition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)
serve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic
cellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as
probability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end
generative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior
distribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is
achieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample
network topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to
predict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework
provides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and
uncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and
systems-level analysis.

Abstract: Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the
field of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI
techniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading
financial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural
networks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent
advancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.
Many developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong
performance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly
referred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real
markets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of
risk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired
by a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are
highly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can
significantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading
conditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational
simulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of
overfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major
Brazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated
superior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the
Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically
significant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight
emerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the
development of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future

Abstract: This article presents a modern deterministic framework for the study of
leading significant digit distributions in numerical data. Rather than relying
on traditional probabilistic or mixture-based explanations, we demonstrate that
the observed frequencies of leading digits are determined by the underlying
arithmetic, algorithmic, and structural properties of the data-generating
process. Our approach centers on a shift-invariant functional equation, whose
general solution is given by explicit affine-plus-periodic formulas. This
structural formulation explains the diversity of digit distributions
encountered in both empirical and mathematical datasets, including cases with
pronounced deviations from logarithmic or scale-invariant profiles.
  We systematically analyze digit distributions in finite and infinite
datasets, address deterministic sequences such as prime numbers and recurrence
relations, and highlight the emergence of block-structured and fractal
features. The article provides critical examination of probabilistic models,
explicit examples and counterexamples, and discusses limitations and open
problems for further research. Overall, this work establishes a unified
mathematical foundation for digital phenomena and offers a versatile toolset
for modeling and analyzing digit patterns in applied and theoretical contexts.

Result: 在高维滤波基准测试中展现了更优的成本-准确性平衡，支持更大集成规模

Conclusion: 流匹配作为可扩展工具，在高维应用中有望支持大规模集成滤波

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is the problem of sequentially estimating the state of
a dynamical system from noisy observations. Recent advances in generative
modeling have inspired new approaches to DA in high-dimensional nonlinear
settings, especially the ensemble score filter (EnSF). However, these come at a
significant computational burden due to slow sampling. In this paper, we
introduce a new filtering framework based on flow matching (FM) -- called the
ensemble flow filter (EnFF) -- to accelerate sampling and enable flexible
design of probability paths. EnFF -- a training-free DA approach -- integrates
MC estimators for the marginal FM vector field (VF) and a localized guidance to
assimilate observations. EnFF has faster sampling and more flexibility in VF
design compared to existing generative modeling for DA. Theoretically, we show
that EnFF encompasses classical filtering methods such as the bootstrap
particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter as special cases. Experiments on
high-dimensional filtering benchmarks demonstrate improved cost-accuracy
tradeoffs and the ability to leverage larger ensembles than prior methods. Our
results highlight the promise of FM as a scalable tool for filtering in
high-dimensional applications that enable the use of large ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 功能性数据在生物医学研究和健康信息学中趋于普遍，但统计分析遇到隐私限制、稀疏采样、无穷维度和非高斯结构等挑战，需要一种方法来生成高质量的替代数据以支持统计分析而不暴露敏感数据。

Method: 构建了一种半参数聚合流模型，基于流匹配思想，能够生成无穷维度的功能性数据，不需要高斯或低秩偏定假设。该方法计算效率高，处理不规则观测，并保证生成函数的平滑性。

Conclusion: SFM提供了一种实用而灵活的解决方案，在现有深度生成方法不适用的场景中生成高质量的功能性数据，有力提升电子健康记录数据在临床应用中的价值。

Abstract: Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous
domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health
informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for
functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints,
sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian
structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named
Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data
to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon
flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate
infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank
assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations,
and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical
and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are
not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the
advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational
efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the
MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database. Our
analysis showcases the ability of SFM to produce high-quality surrogate data
for downstream statistical tasks, highlighting its potential to boost the
utility of EHR data for clinical applications.

Motivation: 传统保形选择在在线场景中允许取消先前选择，这与需要不可逆选择决策的应用（如药物发现）不兼容

Method: 结合在线Benjamini-Hochberg程序，提出OCS-ARC方法，支持非选择数据点后续重新考虑，但一旦选择即不可逆

Result: 理论保证在任何时间步控制FDR在名义水平以下，实验显示在合成和真实数据集上显著提升选择能力

Conclusion: OCS-ARC有效解决了在线保形选择的不可逆选择需求，为资源密集型序列过程提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Selecting a subset of promising candidates from a large pool is crucial
across various scientific and real-world applications. Conformal selection
offers a distribution-free and model-agnostic framework for candidate selection
with uncertainty quantification. While effective in offline settings, its
application to online scenarios, where data arrives sequentially, poses
challenges. Notably, conformal selection permits the deselection of previously
selected candidates, which is incompatible with applications requiring
irreversible selection decisions. This limitation is particularly evident in
resource-intensive sequential processes, such as drug discovery, where
advancing a compound to subsequent stages renders reversal impractical. To
address this issue, we extend conformal selection to an online Accept-to-Reject
Changes (ARC) procedure: non-selected data points can be reconsidered for
selection later, and once a candidate is selected, the decision is
irreversible. Specifically, we propose a novel conformal selection method,
Online Conformal Selection with Accept-to-Reject Changes (dubbed OCS-ARC),
which incorporates online Benjamini-Hochberg procedure into the candidate
selection process. We provide theoretical guarantees that OCS-ARC controls the
false discovery rate (FDR) at or below the nominal level at any timestep under
both i.i.d. and exchangeable data assumptions. Additionally, we theoretically
show that our approach naturally extends to multivariate response settings.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
OCS-ARC significantly improves selection power over the baseline while
maintaining valid FDR control across all examined timesteps.

Motivation: 传统回归分析通常假设数据独立同分布，但现实中的函数型数据往往具有可交换性而非独立性。本文旨在研究在这种更一般的函数型协变量设置下，岭回归方法的理论预测性能。

Method: 利用Barzilai和Shamir的最新结果，在协变量维度独立、四阶矩存在等正则性条件下，推导预测超额风险的概率界限。分析p相对于n以适当速率增长时的收敛行为。

Result: 获得了函数型随机协变量设置下预测超额风险的 probabilistic bounds，揭示了模型各成分在决定收敛行为中的相互作用，以及加性协变量噪声在良性过拟合中的作用。

Conclusion: 在函数型协变量设置下，即使数据不满足独立同分布假设，岭回归方法仍能获得良好的预测性能理论保证，加性噪声在特定条件下可导致良性过拟合现象。

Abstract: We study theoretical predictive performance of ridge and ridge-less
least-squares regression when covariate vectors arise from evaluating $p$
random, means-square continuous functions over a latent metric space at $n$
random and unobserved locations, subject to additive noise. This leads us away
from the standard assumption of i.i.d. data to a setting in which the $n$
covariate vectors are exchangeable but not independent in general. Under an
assumption of independence across dimensions, $4$-th order moment, and other
regularity conditions, we obtain probabilistic bounds on a notion of predictive
excess risk adapted to our random functional covariate setting, making use of
recent results of Barzilai and Shamir. We derive convergence rates in regimes
where $p$ grows suitably fast relative to $n$, illustrating interplay between
ingredients of the model in determining convergence behaviour and the role of
additive covariate noise in benign-overfitting.

Result: 证明PC算法在*分离标准下仍保持一致性，PCstar算法能够定向仅靠d-或*分离无法定向的边

Conclusion: 为MLBNs提供了有效的因果发现方法，扩展了传统算法的适用性

Abstract: Max-linear Bayesian networks (MLBNs) are a relatively recent class of
structural equation models which arise when the random variables involved have
heavy-tailed distributions. Unlike most directed graphical models, MLBNs are
typically not faithful to d-separation and thus classical causal discovery
algorithms such as the PC algorithm or greedy equivalence search can not be
used to accurately recover the true graph structure. In this paper, we begin
the study of constraint-based discovery algorithms for MLBNs given an oracle
for testing conditional independence in the true, unknown graph. We show that
if the oracle is given by the $\ast$-separation criteria in the true graph,
then the PC algorithm remains consistent despite the presence of additional CI
statements implied by $\ast$-separation. We also introduce a new causal
discovery algorithm named "PCstar" which assumes faithfulness to
$C^\ast$-separation and is able to orient additional edges which cannot be
oriented with only d- or $\ast$-separation.

Conclusion: 该方法能更好地处理非正态分布的多维不确定性数据，提供更精确的低维表示，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Multidimensional data is often associated with uncertainties that are not
well-described by normal distributions. In this work, we describe how such
distributions can be projected to a low-dimensional space using
uncertainty-aware principal component analysis (UAPCA). We propose to model
multidimensional distributions using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and derive
the projection from a general formulation that allows projecting arbitrary
probability density functions. The low-dimensional projections of the densities
exhibit more details about the distributions and represent them more faithfully
compared to UAPCA mappings. Further, we support including user-defined weights
between the different distributions, which allows for varying the importance of
the multidimensional distributions. We evaluate our approach by comparing the
distributions in low-dimensional space obtained by our method and UAPCA to
those obtained by sample-based projections.

Conclusion: 为发展更强大的多策略脑受启发学习SNN提供了一个通用且可扩展的基础

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired models known for
low power consumption and superior potential for temporal processing, but
identifying suitable learning mechanisms remains a challenge. Despite the
presence of multiple coexisting learning strategies in the brain, current SNN
training methods typically rely on a single form of synaptic plasticity, which
limits their adaptability and representational capability. In this paper, we
propose a biologically inspired training framework that incorporates multiple
synergistic plasticity mechanisms for more effective SNN training. Our method
enables diverse learning algorithms to cooperatively modulate the accumulation
of information, while allowing each mechanism to preserve its own relatively
independent update dynamics. We evaluated our approach on both static image and
dynamic neuromorphic datasets to demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves performance and robustness compared to conventional learning mechanism
models. This work provides a general and extensible foundation for developing
more powerful SNNs guided by multi-strategy brain-inspired learning.

Result: 评估显示Grok-3-beta在测试的组合框架中达到了最佳性能。多组合框架通过专业角色分工显著提升了协作和执行效率。组合能力归因分析发现，高质量代码生成对任务成功至关重要，自我反思的影响最大，其次是检索增强生成(RAG)和规划。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了代码生成、长上下文处理和上下文感知知识检索方面持续存在的挑战，为计算生物学领域发展健壮的AI组合提供了关键的经验基础和最佳实践。

Abstract: The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in
traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm
shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable
decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive
benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking
evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics
analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse
agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program
synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge
integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell
omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing
technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art
performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly
enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches
through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities
identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and
self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights
persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and
context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation
and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.

### [300] [Too Easily Fooled? Prompt Injection Breaks LLMs on Frustratingly Simple Multiple-Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13214)
*Xuyang Guo,Zekai Huang,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 大语言模型在PDF文件中容易受到隐藏提示注入攻击的影响，在基本算术问题中也会被误导输出结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别LLM作为判断者应用在教育、同行审查等领域的潜力，但关注其在提示注入攻击下的稳健性风险

Method: 通过在PDF文件中注入隐藏提示，测试LLM在基本算术问题（多选题和判断题）上的异常输出行为

Result: 结果显示LLM在这些简单场景中也容易受到隐藏提示注入攻击的影响

Conclusion: 该研究强调了LLM作为判断者应用的严重稳健性风险，需要重视安全防护措施

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong emergent
abilities in complex reasoning and zero-shot generalization, showing
unprecedented potential for LLM-as-a-judge applications in education, peer
review, and data quality evaluation. However, their robustness under prompt
injection attacks, where malicious instructions are embedded into the content
to manipulate outputs, remains a significant concern. In this work, we explore
a frustratingly simple yet effective attack setting to test whether LLMs can be
easily misled. Specifically, we evaluate LLMs on basic arithmetic questions
(e.g., "What is 3 + 2?") presented as either multiple-choice or true-false
judgment problems within PDF files, where hidden prompts are injected into the
file. Our results reveal that LLMs are indeed vulnerable to such hidden prompt
injection attacks, even in these trivial scenarios, highlighting serious
robustness risks for LLM-as-a-judge applications.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地对MCP安全风险进行分类，识别出4个主要攻击面的17种攻击类型，并开发了MCPSecBench基准测试平台来评估这些攻击。实验显示超过85%的攻击至少能成功攻破一个平台。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM通过MCP协议集成到实际应用中，虽然增强了AI代理能力，但也引入了新的安全风险和扩大了攻击面，需要系统性的安全评估框架。

Method: 提出了MCP安全分类法，开发了MCPSecBench基准测试平台，包含提示数据集、MCP服务器、客户端和攻击脚本，支持模块化扩展和跨三个主要MCP提供商的评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，超过85%的攻击成功攻破至少一个平台，核心漏洞普遍影响Claude、OpenAI和Cursor，而基于提示和工具的攻击在不同主机和模型间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: MCPSecBench标准化了MCP安全评估，支持对所有MCP层进行严格测试，为MCP安全研究提供了重要基准工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a universal, open standard
for connecting AI agents with data sources and external tools. While MCP
enhances the capabilities of LLM-based agents, it also introduces new security
risks and expands their attack surfaces. In this paper, we present the first
systematic taxonomy of MCP security, identifying 17 attack types across 4
primary attack surfaces. We introduce MCPSecBench, a comprehensive security
benchmark and playground that integrates prompt datasets, MCP servers, MCP
clients, and attack scripts to evaluate these attacks across three major MCP
providers. Our benchmark is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to
incorporate custom implementations of clients, servers, and transport protocols
for systematic security assessment. Experimental results show that over 85% of
the identified attacks successfully compromise at least one platform, with core
vulnerabilities universally affecting Claude, OpenAI, and Cursor, while
prompt-based and tool-centric attacks exhibit considerable variability across
different hosts and models. Overall, MCPSecBench standardizes the evaluation of
MCP security and enables rigorous testing across all MCP layers.

TL;DR: 利用大语言模型从黑客行为中量化提取损失避免偏见，为网络安全防御提供新的行为基础分析方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网络安全防御策略在动态解释攻击过程中存在空白，需要通过理解攻击者认知偏见来提升防御能力

Method: 采用LLM处理黑客在控制漏洞执行攻击时产生的笔记，将行动分割并与预定义的持久机制相关联

Result: 分析显示了损失避免偏见在黑客决策中的具体表现形式，LLM能有效解析细微的行为模式

Conclusion: LLM提供了一种转型性的方法，能够通过实时行为分析来增强网络安全防御策略

Abstract: Understanding and quantifying human cognitive biases from empirical data has
long posed a formidable challenge, particularly in cybersecurity, where
defending against unknown adversaries is paramount. Traditional cyber defense
strategies have largely focused on fortification, while some approaches attempt
to anticipate attacker strategies by mapping them to cognitive vulnerabilities,
yet they fall short in dynamically interpreting attacks in progress. In
recognition of this gap, IARPA's ReSCIND program seeks to infer, defend
against, and even exploit attacker cognitive traits. In this paper, we present
a novel methodology that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract
quantifiable insights into the cognitive bias of loss aversion from hacker
behavior. Our data are collected from an experiment in which hackers were
recruited to attack a controlled demonstration network. We process the hacker
generated notes using LLMs using it to segment the various actions and
correlate the actions to predefined persistence mechanisms used by hackers. By
correlating the implementation of these mechanisms with various operational
triggers, our analysis provides new insights into how loss aversion manifests
in hacker decision-making. The results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively
dissect and interpret nuanced behavioral patterns, thereby offering a
transformative approach to enhancing cyber defense strategies through
real-time, behavior-based analysis.

### [303] [Involuntary Jailbreak](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13246)
*Yangyang Guo,Yangyan Li,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文揭示了一种称为"非自愿越狱"的新LLM漏洞，仅需单个通用提示即可绕过主流大语言模型的安全防护机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱攻击主要针对LLM防护机制的局部组件，而本文发现整个防护结构存在脆弱性，需要重新评估LLM安全护栏的鲁棒性

Method: 使用单个通用提示，要求LLM生成通常会被拒绝的问题及其深度回答（而非拒绝回答）

Result: 这种简单提示策略能持续越狱大多数主流LLM，包括Claude Opus 4.1、Grok 4、Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT 4.1

Conclusion: 该问题促使研究者和实践者重新评估LLM防护机制的鲁棒性，为未来更强的安全对齐做出贡献

Abstract: In this study, we disclose a worrying new vulnerability in Large Language
Models (LLMs), which we term \textbf{involuntary jailbreak}. Unlike existing
jailbreak attacks, this weakness is distinct in that it does not involve a
specific attack objective, such as generating instructions for \textit{building
a bomb}. Prior attack methods predominantly target localized components of the
LLM guardrail. In contrast, involuntary jailbreaks may potentially compromise
the entire guardrail structure, which our method reveals to be surprisingly
fragile. We merely employ a single universal prompt to achieve this goal. In
particular, we instruct LLMs to generate several questions that would typically
be rejected, along with their corresponding in-depth responses (rather than a
refusal). Remarkably, this simple prompt strategy consistently jailbreaks the
majority of leading LLMs, including Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro,
and GPT 4.1. We hope this problem can motivate researchers and practitioners to
re-evaluate the robustness of LLM guardrails and contribute to stronger safety
alignment in future.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文扩展了HAL 9000入侵容忍系统风险管理器，通过构建自定义爬虫从多样化威胁源获取情报，显著提升了系统对新兴威胁的早期检测和评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有入侵容忍系统风险管理器过度依赖NVD和ExploitDB等需要人工分析的数据源，限制了系统对快速演变威胁的响应能力。HAL 9000虽然通过机器学习有所改进，但仍受限于有限的情报来源。

Method: 构建自定义爬虫持续挖掘多样化威胁源，包括安全公告、研究论坛和实时漏洞利用概念验证，并将这些情报集成到HAL 9000风险管理框架中。

Result: 评估表明，集成爬虫获取的情报显著提升了HAL 9000处理新兴威胁的能力，实现了对未经验证漏洞的更早期检测和评估。

Conclusion: 通过扩展威胁情报来源，HAL 9000的风险管理能力得到实质性增强，为入侵容忍系统提供了更主动的防御能力。

Abstract: Intrusion Tolerant Systems (ITSs) have become increasingly critical due to
the rise of multi-domain adversaries exploiting diverse attack surfaces. ITS
architectures aim to tolerate intrusions, ensuring system compromise is
prevented or mitigated even with adversary presence. Existing ITS solutions
often employ Risk Managers leveraging public security intelligence to adjust
system defenses dynamically against emerging threats. However, these approaches
rely heavily on databases like NVD and ExploitDB, which require manual analysis
for newly discovered vulnerabilities. This dependency limits the system's
responsiveness to rapidly evolving threats. HAL 9000, an ITS Risk Manager
introduced in our prior work, addressed these challenges through machine
learning. By analyzing descriptions of known vulnerabilities, HAL 9000 predicts
and assesses new vulnerabilities automatically. To calculate the risk of a
system, it also incorporates the Exploitability Probability Scoring system to
estimate the likelihood of exploitation within 30 days, enhancing proactive
defense capabilities.
  Despite its success, HAL 9000's reliance on NVD and ExploitDB knowledge is a
limitation, considering the availability of other sources of information. This
extended work introduces a custom-built scraper that continuously mines diverse
threat sources, including security advisories, research forums, and real-time
exploit proofs-of-concept. This significantly expands HAL 9000's intelligence
base, enabling earlier detection and assessment of unverified vulnerabilities.
Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating scraper-derived intelligence with
HAL 9000's risk management framework substantially improves its ability to
address emerging threats. This paper details the scraper's integration into the
architecture, its role in providing additional information on new threats, and
the effects on HAL 9000's management.

TL;DR: 基于低频率(25Hz)多通道PPG信号的智能手表连续身份验证系统，通过Bi-LSTM注意力机制实现88.11%准确度，同时将传感器功耗降低53%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高频率PPG身份验证系统的能源和计算开销大问题，提供一种适用于功能受限可穿戴设备的连续、非侵入式身份验证方案

Method: 使用低频率(25Hz)多通道PPG信号，采用带注意力机制的Bi-LSTM模型从短时间窗口(4秒)中提取特征，在智能手表上实现实际部署

Result: 在公共数据集和自建数据集(26名参与者)上达到88.11%平均测试准确度，FAR 0.48%，FRR 11.77%，EER 2.76%，传感器功耗相比512Hz降低53%

Conclusion: 25Hz低频率PPG可以在保持身份验证性能的同时大幅降低能源消耗，是可穿戴设备中的实用下限，同时活动多样性训练能提升模型在不同生理状态下的稳健性

Abstract: Biometric authentication using physiological signals offers a promising path
toward secure and user-friendly access control in wearable devices. While
electrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their
intrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit
practicality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables
continuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into
wrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency
PPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy
and computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world
systems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and
evaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band,
using low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a
Bi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from
short (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both
public datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate
strong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%,
macro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection
Rate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%. Our 25 Hz system
reduces sensor power consumption by 53% compared to 512 Hz and 19% compared to
128 Hz setups without compromising performance. We find that sampling at 25 Hz
preserves authentication accuracy, whereas performance drops sharply at 20 Hz
while offering only trivial additional power savings, underscoring 25 Hz as the
practical lower bound. Additionally, we find that models trained exclusively on
resting data fail under motion, while activity-diverse training improves
robustness across physiological states.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm
enabling multiple clients to train a global model collaboratively without
sharing their raw data. While FL enhances data privacy by design, it remains
vulnerable to various security and privacy threats. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of more than 200 papers regarding the state-of-the-art
attacks and defense mechanisms developed to address these challenges,
categorizing them into security-enhancing and privacy-preserving techniques.
Security-enhancing methods aim to improve FL robustness against malicious
behaviors such as byzantine attacks, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. At the same
time, privacy-preserving techniques focus on protecting sensitive data through
cryptographic approaches, differential privacy, and secure aggregation. We
critically analyze the strengths and limitations of existing methods, highlight
the trade-offs between privacy, security, and model performance, and discuss
the implications of non-IID data distributions on the effectiveness of these
defenses. Furthermore, we identify open research challenges and future
directions, including the need for scalable, adaptive, and energy-efficient
solutions operating in dynamic and heterogeneous FL environments. Our survey
aims to guide researchers and practitioners in developing robust and
privacy-preserving FL systems, fostering advancements safeguarding
collaborative learning frameworks' integrity and confidentiality.

Result: 在7个合成场景的6个评估指标中，在C-L1、F-score和IoU方面表现最佳，在NC、准确性和完整性方面保持竞争力

Conclusion: PreSem-Surf方法在场景表面重建方面表现出色，具有有效性和实际应用价值

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP
(Preconditioning Multilayer Perceptron) is introduced for voxel pre-rendering,
allowing the model to capture scene-related information earlier and better
distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while
maintaining competitive results in NC, Accuracy, and Completeness,
demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大视角变化视频的结构编辑挑战，实现了精确的3D感知视频编辑

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模和散射感知渲染成功解决了NeRF在处理运动模糊时的局限性，为复杂光路场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Abstract: This work highlights the duality between state estimation methods and model
predictive control. A predictive controller, observed control, is presented
that uses this duality to efficiently compute control actions with linear
time-horizon length scalability. The proposed algorithms provide exceptional
computational efficiency, adaptive time horizon lengths, and early optimization
termination criteria. The use of Kalman smoothers as the backend optimization
framework provides for a straightforward implementation supported by strong
theoretical guarantees. Additionally, a formulation is presented that separates
linear model predictive control into purely reactive and anticipatory
components, enabling any-time any-horizon observed control while ensuring
controller stability for short time horizons. Finally, numerical case studies
confirm that nonlinear filter extensions, i.e., the extended Kalman filter and
unscented Kalman filter, effectively extend observed control to nonlinear
systems and objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络数据传输安全和隐私保护需求日益增长，需要在保持视频原始质量的前提下实现高效数据隐藏

Method: 采用遗传算法(GA)识别视频中最适合嵌入数据的关键区域(ROI)，使用AES标准加密秘密数据，在覆盖视频中嵌入达10%的数据量

Result: 方案实现了高嵌入容量和高效率，PSNR值在64-75dB之间，嵌入数据与原视频几乎无法区分，编码解码速度快，适合实时应用

Conclusion: 该方法通过遗传算法优化ROI选择和AES加密，成功实现了高安全性、高质量、高效率的视频隐写术，为实时数据传输安全提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the widespread use of the internet, there is an increasing need to
ensure the security and privacy of transmitted data. This has led to an
intensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique
that hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of
any steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering
the original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper
proposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a
Genetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the
cover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for
data embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being
embedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This
process ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The
performance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to
Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that
the proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生背景知识和胸部X光片病变信息，提高识别效果并降低诊断不确定性，以解决医生对医疗AI系统的信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期发现和快速干预肺癌至关重要，但医生诊断能力受经验和疲劳度影响。医疗AI虽然发展快速，但医生对其不确定性的担忧导致信任不足，阻碍了临床应用。根本原因是医疗AI仅依靠病变数据学习，缺乏医生的背景知识和临床经验。

Method: 提出不确定性感知学习策略(Uncertainty-Aware Learning Policy)，同时学习医生的背景知识和胸部X光片病变信息。使用了来自Ajou大学医院2,517张无病变图像和656张结节图像。

Result: 提案模型达到92%识别率(IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2)，敏感度比基准模型提高10%，并将作为不确定性指标的熵提降低了0.2。

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效解决医疗AI知识不足导致的诊断不确定性问题，提高诊断准确性和可靠性，有助于推进医疗AI的临床应用。

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that leverages 3D pseudo-continuous arterial
spin labeling (3D pCASL) MRI to compute sex-specific vascular scores that
quantify cerebrovascular health and potential disease susceptibility. The brain
is parcellated into spatially contiguous regions of homogeneous perfusion using
supervoxel clustering, capturing both microvascular and macrovascular
contributions. Mean cerebral blood flow (CBF) values are extracted from 186
cognitively healthy participants and used to train a custom convolutional
neural network, achieving 95 percent accuracy in sex classification. This
highlights robust, sex-specific perfusion patterns across the brain.
Additionally, regional CBF variations and age-related effects are
systematically evaluated within male and female cohorts. The proposed vascular
risk-scoring framework enhances understanding of normative brain perfusion and
aging, and may facilitate early detection and personalized interventions for
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Conclusion: 该轻量级AI系统为资源稀缺地区提供了一种有前景的自动化子宫预防筛查方案，能够在无需高级医疗资源的情况下实时提供精准检测结果

Abstract: Cervical cancer is among the most commonly occurring cancer among women and
claims a huge number of lives in low and middle-income countries despite being
relatively easy to treat. Several studies have shown that public screening
programs can bring down cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates
significantly. While several screening tests are available, visual inspection
with acetic acid (VIA) presents itself as the most viable option for
low-resource settings due to the affordability and simplicity of performing the
test. VIA requires a trained medical professional to interpret the test and is
subjective in nature. Automating VIA using AI eliminates subjectivity and would
allow shifting of the task to less trained health workers. Task shifting with
AI would help further expedite screening programs in low-resource settings. In
our work, we propose a lightweight deep learning algorithm that includes
EfficientDet-Lite3 as the Region of Interest (ROI) detector and a MobileNet- V2
based model for classification. These models would be deployed on an
android-based device that can operate remotely and provide almost instant
results without the requirement of highly-trained medical professionals, labs,
sophisticated infrastructure, or internet connectivity. The classification
model gives an accuracy of 92.31%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, and a specificity
of 88.37% on the test dataset and presents itself as a promising automated
low-resource screening approach.

assess whether recent advances in large multimodal models translate into
measurable gains in these safety-critical domains. We present a targeted
zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)

zero-shot evaluation of GPT-5 and its smaller variants (GPT-5-mini, GPT-5-nano)
against GPT-4o across three representative tasks: (1) VQA-RAD, a benchmark for
visual question answering in radiology; (2) SLAKE, a semantically annotated,
multilingual VQA dataset testing cross-modal grounding; and (3) a curated
Medical Physics Board Examination-style dataset of 150 multiple-choice

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了儿科脱骨骼病变研究的数据空白，为进一步研究提供了价值较高的资源，并强调了多样化数据集在医学图像分析中的关键作用

Abstract: Demyelinating disorders of the central nervous system may have multiple
causes, the most common are infections, autoimmune responses, genetic or
vascular etiology. Demyelination lesions are characterized by areas were the
myelin sheath of the nerve fibers are broken or destroyed. Among autoimmune
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known Among these
disorders, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most well-known and aggressive form.
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is another type of demyelinating
disease, typically with a better prognosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is
widely used for diagnosing and monitoring disease progression by detecting
lesions. While both adults and children can be affected, there is a significant
lack of publicly available datasets for pediatric cases and demyelinating
disorders beyond MS. This study introduces, for the first time, a publicly
available pediatric dataset for demyelinating lesion segmentation. The dataset
comprises MRI scans from 13 pediatric patients diagnosed with demyelinating
disorders, including 3 with ADEM. In addition to lesion segmentation masks, the
dataset includes extensive patient metadata, such as diagnosis, treatment,
personal medical background, and laboratory results. To assess the quality of
the dataset and demonstrate its relevance, we evaluate a state-of-the-art
lesion segmentation model trained on an existing MS dataset. The results
underscore the importance of diverse datasets

Conclusion: InnerGS为内部场景重建提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，填补了现有技术在内部结构建模方面的空白

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained popularity for efficient
scene rendering by representing scenes as explicit sets of anisotropic 3D
Gaussians. However, most existing work focuses primarily on modeling external
surfaces. In this work, we target the reconstruction of internal scenes, which
is crucial for applications that require a deep understanding of an object's
interior. By directly modeling a continuous volumetric density through the
inner 3D Gaussian distribution, our model effectively reconstructs smooth and
detailed internal structures from sparse sliced data. Our approach eliminates
the need for camera poses, is plug-and-play, and is inherently compatible with
any data modalities. We provide cuda implementation at:

Conclusion: 该深度学习方法为碳碰性扭曲效应缔正提供了一种高效且实用的替代方案，特别适用于只有单向编码数据的情况

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a valuable tool to map brain microstructure and
connectivity by analyzing water molecule diffusion in tissue. However,
acquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short
time, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is
susceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and
intensity deformations. Traditional correction methods, such as topup, rely on
having access to blip-up and blip-down image pairs, limiting their
applicability to retrospective data acquired with a single phase encoding
direction. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based approach to correct
susceptibility distortions using only a single acquisition (either blip-up or
blip-down), eliminating the need for paired acquisitions. Experimental results
show that our method achieves performance comparable to topup, demonstrating
its potential as an efficient and practical alternative for susceptibility
distortion correction in dMRI.

Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for evaluating the prognosis of
cancer patients. Present WSI-based prognosis studies generally follow a
conventional paradigm -- cancer-specific model development -- where one cancer
disease corresponds to one model and this model cannot make use of the
prognostic knowledge from others. Despite its notable success in recent years,
this paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with
practical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very
limited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge
in other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study
on Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises
three main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers
and use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between
different cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what
factors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)
Motivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)
with a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in
other cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare
tumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of
knowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis. Source code is available at

Abstract: This systematic review critically evaluates publicly available abdominal CT
datasets and their suitability for artificial intelligence (AI) applications in
clinical settings. We examined 46 publicly available abdominal CT datasets
(50,256 studies). Across all 46 datasets, we found substantial redundancy
(59.1\% case reuse) and a Western/geographic skew (75.3\% from North America
and Europe). A bias assessment was performed on the 19 datasets with >=100
cases; within this subset, the most prevalent high-risk categories were domain
shift (63\%) and selection bias (57\%), both of which may undermine model
generalizability across diverse healthcare environments -- particularly in
resource-limited settings. To address these challenges, we propose targeted
strategies for dataset improvement, including multi-institutional
collaboration, adoption of standardized protocols, and deliberate inclusion of
diverse patient populations and imaging technologies. These efforts are crucial
in supporting the development of more equitable and clinically robust AI models
for abdominal imaging.

Abstract: High-throughput screening using automated microscopes is a key driver in
biopharma drug discovery, enabling the parallel evaluation of thousands of drug
candidates for diseases such as cancer. Traditional image analysis and deep
learning approaches have been employed to analyze these complex, large-scale
datasets, with cell segmentation serving as a critical step for extracting
relevant structures. However, both strategies typically require extensive
manual parameter tuning or domain-specific model fine-tuning. We present a
novel method that applies a segmentation foundation model in a zero-shot
setting (i.e., without fine-tuning), guided by an in-context learning strategy.
Our approach employs a three-step process for nuclei, cell, and subcellular
segmentation, introducing a self-prompting mechanism that encodes morphological
and topological priors using growing masks and strategically placed
foreground/background points. We validate our method on both standard cell
segmentation benchmarks and industry-relevant hit validation assays,
demonstrating that it accurately segments biologically relevant structures
without the need for dataset-specific tuning.

Abstract: Accurate compensation of brain shift is critical for maintaining the
reliability of neuronavigation during neurosurgery. While keypoint-based
registration methods offer robustness to large deformations and topological
changes, they typically rely on simple geometric interpolators that ignore
tissue biomechanics to create dense displacement fields. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning framework that estimates dense, physically
plausible brain deformations from sparse matched keypoints. We first generate a
large dataset of synthetic brain deformations using biomechanical simulations.
Then, a residual 3D U-Net is trained to refine standard interpolation estimates
into biomechanically guided deformations. Experiments on a large set of
simulated displacement fields demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms classical interpolators, reducing by half the mean square error
while introducing negligible computational overhead at inference time. Code

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI is essential for breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. However, its reliance on contrast agents introduces safety
concerns, contraindications, increased cost, and workflow complexity. To this
end, we present pre-contrast conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic
models to synthesize DCE-MRI, introducing, evaluating, and comparing a total of
22 generative model variants in both single-breast and full breast settings.
Towards enhancing lesion fidelity, we introduce both tumor-aware loss functions
and explicit tumor segmentation mask conditioning. Using a public multicenter
dataset and comparing to respective pre-contrast baselines, we observe that
subtraction image-based models consistently outperform post-contrast-based
models across five complementary evaluation metrics. Apart from assessing the
entire image, we also separately evaluate the region of interest, where both
tumor-aware losses and segmentation mask inputs improve evaluation metrics. The
latter notably enhance qualitative results capturing contrast uptake, albeit
assuming access to tumor localization inputs that are not guaranteed to be
available in screening settings. A reader study involving 2 radiologists and 4
MRI technologists confirms the high realism of the synthetic images, indicating
an emerging clinical potential of generative contrast-enhancement. We share our
codebase at https://github.com/sebastibar/conditional-diffusion-breast-MRI.

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a critical tool for diagnosing
and managing cardiovascular disease, yet its utility is often limited by the
sparse acquisition of 2D short-axis slices, resulting in incomplete volumetric
information. Accurate 3D reconstruction from these sparse slices is essential
for comprehensive cardiac assessment, but existing methods face challenges,
including reliance on predefined interpolation schemes (e.g., linear or
spherical), computational inefficiency, and dependence on additional semantic
inputs such as segmentation labels or motion data. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{Ca}rdiac \textbf{L}atent
\textbf{I}nterpolation \textbf{D}iffusion (CaLID) framework that introduces
three key innovations. First, we present a data-driven interpolation scheme
based on diffusion models, which can capture complex, non-linear relationships
between sparse slices and improves reconstruction accuracy. Second, we design a
computationally efficient method that operates in the latent space and speeds
up 3D whole-heart upsampling time by a factor of 24, reducing computational
overhead compared to previous methods. Third, with only sparse 2D CMR images as
input, our method achieves SOTA performance against baseline methods,
eliminating the need for auxiliary input such as morphological guidance, thus
simplifying workflows. We further extend our method to 2D+T data, enabling the
effective modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring temporal coherence.
Extensive volumetric evaluations and downstream segmentation tasks demonstrate
that CaLID achieves superior reconstruction quality and efficiency. By
addressing the fundamental limitations of existing approaches, our framework
advances the state of the art for spatio and spatiotemporal whole-heart
reconstruction, offering a robust and clinically practical solution for
cardiovascular imaging.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the
brain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is
important for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical
management. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler
(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,
affordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend
heavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and
performing accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To
address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW
auto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No
prior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.
In this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)
network tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for
brain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data
comprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish
a high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO
demonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and
contralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of
0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame
inference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce
reliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with
potential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained
settings. Future research will explore bilateral modeling and larger-scale
validation.

Conclusion: NeuSee是首个能够处理动态变化激光波长、强度和位置的全光谱计算成像框架，在激光抑制和图像恢复质量方面优于其他学习方法。

Abstract: Machine vision systems are susceptible to laser flare, where unwanted intense
laser illumination blinds and distorts its perception of the environment
through oversaturation or permanent damage to sensor pixels. We introduce
NeuSee, the first computational imaging framework for high-fidelity sensor
protection across the full visible spectrum. It jointly learns a neural
representation of a diffractive optical element (DOE) and a frequency-space
Mamba-GAN network for image restoration. NeuSee system is adversarially trained
end-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high
as $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\textrm{sat}}$, the point
at which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system
leverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,
integrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for
realistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account
open-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and
positions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,
and sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum
imaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\% improvement in

Conclusion: 相似性融合块和one-hot标签空间的有效结合显著提升了模型性能，证明了多数据集协同训练的可行性和优势

Abstract: Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the
segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most
methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,
or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available
annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various
modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim
to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance
on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called
MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features
Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity
knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address
inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot
label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.
MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities
to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH
grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for
medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved
the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for
the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1
for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight
the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity
Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity
knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label
class inconsistencies and contradictions.

Motivation: 传统基于CT的骨骼模型创建方法由于CT的低灵活性、高辐射暴露和耗时的手动描绘，仅限于术前使用，需要一种更快速、安全的替代方案。

Method: 提出了半监督重建与知识蒸馏（SSR-KD）框架，利用双平面X光片进行骨骼模型重建，结合知识蒸馏技术提高重建精度。

Abstract: Patient-specific bone models are essential for designing surgical guides and
preoperative planning, as they enable the visualization of intricate anatomical
structures. However, traditional CT-based approaches for creating bone models
are limited to preoperative use due to the low flexibility and high radiation
exposure of CT and time-consuming manual delineation. Here, we introduce
Semi-Supervised Reconstruction with Knowledge Distillation (SSR-KD), a fast and
accurate AI framework to reconstruct high-quality bone models from biplanar
X-rays in 30 seconds, with an average error under 1.0 mm, eliminating the
dependence on CT and manual work. Additionally, high tibial osteotomy
simulation was performed by experts on reconstructed bone models, demonstrating
that bone models reconstructed from biplanar X-rays have comparable clinical
applicability to those annotated from CT. Overall, our approach accelerates the
process, reduces radiation exposure, enables intraoperative guidance, and
significantly improves the practicality of bone models, offering transformative
applications in orthopedics.

TL;DR: UNICON是一个统一的持续学习框架，使医学基础模型能够无缝适应不同领域、任务和模态，无需为每个新任务重新训练，避免了灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺，难以针对每个领域、模态或任务进行预训练。持续学习可以通过顺序微调模型来整合新知识，而无需为每个训练阶段准备大型数据集。

Method: 提出UNICON框架，通过精心整合使基础模型能够动态扩展到不同的成像模态、解剖区域和临床目标，避免灾难性遗忘和任务干扰。

Result: 将胸部CT基础模型从分类任务适应到预后和分割任务，在两个附加任务上都表现出改进的性能。持续整合PET扫描后，Dice评分比相应基线提高了5%。

Conclusion: 基础模型并不固有地受限于其初始训练范围，而是可以不断演化，为医学影像通用AI模型的发展铺平道路。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general
trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes
pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual
learning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different
domains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring
large datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied
CONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that
enables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,
and modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes
in isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.
Through careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically
expand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives
without catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate
our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for
classification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved
performance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually
incorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\% improvement in Dice score compared to
respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not
inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving
the way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.

Motivation: 虽然耳螺电机在重度听力损失患者中取得了成功，但在噪声或混响环境中的语音理解仍面临挑战。深度学习技术为提升CI声音编码能力提供了新机遇。

Method: 设计了AVSE-ECS系统，使用视觉-听觉语音增强模型作为预处理模块，结合深度学习基础的ElectrodeNet-CS声音编码策略，采用联合训练方法构建端到端的CI系统。

Result: 实验结果显示，在噪声条件下，该方法在对象性语音可懂性指标上超过了之前的ECS策略，表现更优。

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了将AVSE模块集成到端到端CI系统中的可行性和潜力，为深度学习在耳螺电机技术中的应用开启了新方向。

Abstract: The cochlear implant (CI) is a remarkable biomedical device that successfully
enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound by
converting speech into electrical stimulation signals. Despite advancements in
the performance of recent CI systems, speech comprehension in noisy or
reverberant conditions remains a challenge. Recent and ongoing developments in
deep learning reveal promising opportunities for enhancing CI sound coding
capabilities, not only through replicating traditional signal processing
methods with neural networks, but also through integrating visual cues as
auxiliary data for multimodal speech processing. Therefore, this paper
introduces a novel noise-suppressing CI system, AVSE-ECS, which utilizes an
audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) model as a pre-processing module for the
deep-learning-based ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) sound coding strategy. Specifically,
a joint training approach is applied to model AVSE-ECS, an end-to-end CI
system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the
previous ECS strategy in noisy conditions, with improved objective speech
intelligibility scores. The methods and findings in this study demonstrate the
feasibility and potential of using deep learning to integrate the AVSE module
into an end-to-end CI system

Conclusion: 该基准测试揭示了AI系统在音频通用智能方面的具体不足，为社区提供了可操作的视角来增强未来AI系统的音频理解能力

Abstract: Audio comprehension-including speech, non-speech sounds, and music-is
essential for achieving human-level intelligence. Consequently, AI agents must
demonstrate holistic audio understanding to qualify as generally intelligent.
However, evaluating auditory intelligence comprehensively remains challenging.
To address this gap, we introduce MMAU-Pro, the most comprehensive and
rigorously curated benchmark for assessing audio intelligence in AI systems.
MMAU-Pro contains 5,305 instances, where each instance has one or more audios
paired with human expert-generated question-answer pairs, spanning speech,
sound, music, and their combinations. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro
evaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex
dimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning,
multi-audio understanding, among others. All questions are meticulously
designed to require deliberate multi-hop reasoning, including both
multiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Importantly, audio data is
sourced directly ``from the wild" rather than from existing datasets with known
distributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI
models, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as
Gemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy,
respectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories. Our
extensive analysis highlights specific shortcomings and provides novel
insights, offering actionable perspectives for the community to enhance future
AI systems' progression toward audio general intelligence. The benchmark and

introduces the shift from laborious enumeration of MOF candidates to generative
approaches that can autonomously propose and synthesize in the laboratory new

deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders, diffusion models, and
large language model-based agents, that are fueled by the growing amount of
available data from the MOF community and suggest novel crystalline materials
designs. These generative tools can be combined with high-throughput
computational screening and even automated experiments to form accelerated,
closed-loop discovery pipelines. The result is a new paradigm for reticular
chemistry in which AI algorithms more efficiently direct the search for
high-performance MOF materials for clean air and energy applications. Finally,
we highlight remaining challenges such as synthetic feasibility, dataset
diversity, and the need for further integration of domain knowledge.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

Motivation: 非洲在全球AI安全讨论中缺乏语诚，面临着独特的风险挑战，需要特别关注和应对策略。

Method: 通过识别非洲AI风险配置特征，分析现有监管空白，提出以人权为本的五点行动计划。

Result: 识别了深度假造干扰选举、数据政策依赖、计算资源短缺、劳动力市场击穿等关键风险领域。

Abstract: This paper maps Africa's distinctive AI risk profile, from deepfake fuelled
electoral interference and data colonial dependency to compute scarcity, labour
disruption and disproportionate exposure to climate driven environmental costs.
While major benefits are promised to accrue, the availability, development and
adoption of AI also mean that African people and countries face particular AI
safety risks, from large scale labour market disruptions to the nefarious use
of AI to manipulate public opinion. To date, African perspectives have not been
meaningfully integrated into global debates and processes regarding AI safety,
leaving African stakeholders with limited influence over the emerging global AI
safety governance agenda. While there are Computer Incident Response Teams on
the continent, none hosts a dedicated AI Safety Institute or office. We propose
a five-point action plan centred on (i) a policy approach that foregrounds the
protection of the human rights of those most vulnerable to experiencing the
harmful socio-economic effects of AI; (ii) the establishment of an African AI
Safety Institute; (iii) promote public AI literacy and awareness; (iv)
development of early warning system with inclusive benchmark suites for 25+
African languages; and (v) an annual AU-level AI Safety & Security Forum.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to
ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying
course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative
difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality
control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g.,
articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course
difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when
difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled
students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By
assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can
reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of
difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement
must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses.
Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the
characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g.,
transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been
proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of
existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point
averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on
model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These
applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting
courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g.,
dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and
equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we
provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating
reproducibility and adoption.

Motivation: 数字化生态系统中消费者自主性受到突出挑战，包括强制消费、算法诱导和收入不稳定等因素，需要研究这些系统性差异如何影响消费选择的真实性和财务健康。

Method: 构建基于折扣消费约束的形式模型，分析消费者面临强制支付、算法影响的即兴消费和不可预知收入的情况，通过理论分析证明自主性限制导致的财务风险。

Result: 研究发现即使是理性的效用最大化消费者，在结构性、行为性或时间性自主性受限时，也可能遇到早期财务死亡，质疑了消费选择的真实性并影响长期财务健康。

Conclusion: 消费者自主性应被视为需要积极培育的价值，而非理所当然。通过形式模型将自主性限制与可测风险联系，为规范性方案如系统干预和消费者教育提供理论基础，支持价值思考和明智选择。

Abstract: Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic
barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity
of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external
pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable
work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like
hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like
personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work
schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how
these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models
grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We
construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,
algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to
temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,
utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is
limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how
diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central
argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)
requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection
between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that
limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be
rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This
connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,
by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As
solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support
value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these
measures strengthen agency.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, integrated, and widespread, understanding
the associated risks becomes increasingly important. This paper maps the full
spectrum of AI risks, from current harms affecting individual users to
existential threats that could endanger humanity's survival. We organize these
risks into three main causal categories. Misuse risks, which occur when people
deliberately use AI for harmful purposes - creating bioweapons, launching
cyberattacks, adversarial AI attacks or deploying lethal autonomous weapons.
Misalignment risks happen when AI systems pursue outcomes that conflict with
human values, irrespective of developer intentions. This includes risks arising
through specification gaming (reward hacking), scheming and power-seeking
tendencies in pursuit of long-term strategic goals. Systemic risks, which arise
when AI integrates into complex social systems in ways that gradually undermine
human agency - concentrating power, accelerating political and economic
disempowerment, creating overdependence that leads to human enfeeblement, or
irreversibly locking in current values curtailing future moral progress. Beyond
these core categories, we identify risk amplifiers - competitive pressures,
accidents, corporate indifference, and coordination failures - that make all
risks more likely and severe. Throughout, we connect today's existing risks and
empirically observable AI behaviors to plausible future outcomes, demonstrating
how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes. Our goal is to
help readers understand the complete landscape of AI risks. Good futures are
possible, but they don't happen by default. Navigating these challenges will
require unprecedented coordination, but an extraordinary future awaits if we
do.

TL;DR: 基于gm/Id方法的LLM协同推理框架，实现了模拟电路设计的数据驱动自动化，效率提升10倍以上


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟电路设计依赖经验且模拟效率低，高级制程中传统公式失效，直接使用LLM容易变成猜测而缺乏工程原理

Method: 构建"协同推理"框架，结合LLM的战略推理能力和gm/Id方法的物理精度，通过gm/Id查找表为LLM提供数据支持

Result: 在两级运放设计中，Gemini模型在5次迭代内满足TT角点规格，并扩展到所有PVT角点优化，效率比高级工程师提升10倍

Conclusion: 通过结合LLM推理和科学电路设计方法论，该框架为真正的模拟电路设计自动化提供了可行路径

Abstract: Analog IC design is a bottleneck due to its reliance on experience and
inefficient simulations, as traditional formulas fail in advanced nodes.
Applying Large Language Models (LLMs) directly to this problem risks mere
"guessing" without engineering principles. We present a "synergistic reasoning"
framework that integrates an LLM's strategic reasoning with the physical
precision of the gm/Id methodology. By empowering the LLM with gm/Id lookup
tables, it becomes a quantitative, data-driven design partner.
  We validated this on a two-stage op-amp, where our framework enabled the
Gemini model to meet all TT corner specs in 5 iterations and extended
optimization to all PVT corners. A crucial ablation study proved gm/Id data is
key for this efficiency and precision; without it, the LLM is slower and
deviates. Compared to a senior engineer's design, our framework achieves
quasi-expert quality with an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency. This
work validates a path for true analog design automation by combining LLM
reasoning with scientific circuit design methodologies.

Conclusion: EvoVerilog框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过结合LLMs和进化算法实现了硬件设计代码生成的自动化和多样化探索。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in automating
the generation of Verilog hardware description language code for hardware
design. This automation is critical to reducing human effort in the complex and
error-prone process of hardware design.
  However, existing approaches predominantly rely on human intervention and
fine-tuning using curated datasets, limiting their scalability in automated
design workflows.
  Although recent iterative search techniques have emerged, they often fail to
explore diverse design solutions and may underperform simpler approaches such
as repeated prompting.
  To address these limitations, we introduce EvoVerilog, a novel framework that
combines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to
automatically generate and refine Verilog code.
  EvoVerilog utilizes a multiobjective, population-based search strategy to
explore a wide range of design possibilities without requiring human
intervention.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoVerilog achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with pass@10 scores of 89.1 and 80.2 on the VerilogEval-Machine
and VerilogEval-Human benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, the framework
showcases its ability to explore diverse designs by simultaneously generating a
variety of functional Verilog code while optimizing resource utilization.

Conclusion: 该研究为模拟集成电路图到网表格的转换提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了转换准确性，有助于大语言模型在模拟IC设计领域的应用发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) exhibits great potential in designing of analog
integrated circuits (IC) because of its excellence in abstraction and
generalization for knowledge. However, further development of LLM-based analog
ICs heavily relies on textual description of analog ICs, while existing analog
ICs are mostly illustrated in image-based circuit diagrams rather than
text-based netlists. Converting circuit diagrams to netlists help LLMs to
enrich the knowledge of analog IC. Nevertheless, previously proposed conversion
frameworks face challenges in further application because of limited support of
image styles and circuit elements. Up to now, it still remains a challenging
task to effectively convert complex circuit diagrams into netlists. To this
end, this paper constructs and opensources a new dataset with rich styles of
circuit diagrams as well as balanced distribution of simple and complex analog
ICs. And a hybrid framework, named Image2Net, is proposed for practical
conversion from circuit diagrams to netlists. The netlist edit distance (NED)
is also introduced to precisely assess the difference between the converted
netlists and ground truth. Based on our benchmark, Image2Net achieves 80.77\%
successful rate, which is 34.62\%-45.19\% higher than previous works.
Specifically, the proposed work shows 0.116 averaged NED, which is
62.1\%-69.6\% lower than state-of-the-arts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统布图规划器在现代约束条件下往往忽视引脚分配，这影响了后续详细布局和布线的性能。需要一种能同时处理模块布局和引脚分配的综合解决方案。

Method: 基于模块几何关系和网表连接构建图结构，迭代搜索最短路径确定引脚分配；采用空白空间移除策略和三个局部优化器来提升多约束场景下的布局质量。

Result: 在基准电路上实现平均6.81%的HPWL减少、13.39%的馈通线长减少、16.36%的馈通模块数量减少和21.21%的未放置引脚减少，同时保持零空白空间。

Conclusion: Piano框架有效解决了现代VLSI布图规划中的多约束问题，通过同时优化模块布局和引脚分配显著提升了整体设计质量。

Abstract: Floorplanning is a critical step in VLSI physical design, increasingly
complicated by modern constraints such as fixed-outline requirements,
whitespace removal, and the presence of pre-placed modules. In addition, the
assignment of pins on module boundaries significantly impacts the performance
of subsequent stages, including detailed placement and routing. However,
traditional floorplanners often overlook pin assignment with modern constraints
during the floorplanning stage. In this work, we introduce Piano, a
floorplanning framework that simultaneously optimizes module placement and pin
assignment under multiple constraints. Specifically, we construct a graph based
on the geometric relationships among modules and their netlist connections,
then iteratively search for shortest paths to determine pin assignments. This
graph-based method also enables accurate evaluation of feedthrough and unplaced
pins, thereby guiding overall layout quality. To further improve the design, we
adopt a whitespace removal strategy and employ three local optimizers to
enhance layout metrics under multi-constraint scenarios. Experimental results
on widely used benchmark circuits demonstrate that Piano achieves an average
6.81% reduction in HPWL, a 13.39% decrease in feedthrough wirelength, a 16.36%
reduction in the number of feedthrough modules, and a 21.21% drop in unplaced
pins, while maintaining zero whitespace.

Abstract: In particular, large-scale deep learning and artificial intelligence model
training uses a lot of computational power and energy, so it poses serious
sustainability issues. The fast rise in model complexity has resulted in
exponential increases in energy consumption, increasing the demand for
techniques maximizing computational efficiency and lowering environmental
impact. This work explores environmentally driven performance optimization
methods especially intended for advanced GPU architectures from NVIDIA, AMD,
and other emerging GPU architectures. Our main focus is on investigating
hardware-software co-design techniques meant to significantly increase
memory-level and kernel-level operations, so improving performance-per-watt
measures. Our thorough research encompasses evaluations of specialized tensor
and matrix cores, advanced memory optimization methods, and creative
integration approaches that taken together result in notable energy efficiency
increases. We also discuss important software-level optimizations that augment
hardware capability including mixed-precision arithmetic, advanced energy-aware
scheduling algorithms, and compiler-driven kernel enhancements. Moreover, we
methodically point out important research gaps and suggest future directions
necessary to create really sustainable artificial intelligence systems. This
paper emphasizes how major increases in training efficiency can be obtained by
co-design of hardware and software, so lowering the environmental impact of
artificial intelligence without compromising performance. To back up our
analysis, we use real-world case studies from top companies like Meta, Google,
Amazon, and others that show how these sustainable AI training methods are used
in the real world.

Conclusion: 异构内存系统为缓解LLM推理的内存带宽压力提供了新的解决方案，动态KV缓存管理存在重要的优化机会，需要更深入的算法研究。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference is increasingly constrained by memory
bandwidth, with frequent access to the key-value (KV) cache dominating data
movement. While attention sparsity reduces some memory traffic, the relevance
of past tokens varies over time, requiring the full KV cache to remain
accessible and sustaining pressure on both bandwidth and capacity. With
advances in interconnects such as NVLink and LPDDR5X, modern AI hardware now
integrates high-bandwidth memory (HBM) with high-speed off-package DRAM, making
heterogeneous memory systems a practical solution. This work investigates
dynamic KV cache placement across such systems to maximize aggregated bandwidth
utilization under capacity constraints. Rather than proposing a specific
scheduling policy, we formulate the placement problem mathematically and derive
a theoretical upper bound, revealing substantial headroom for runtime
optimization. To our knowledge, this is the first formal treatment of dynamic
KV cache scheduling in heterogeneous memory systems for LLM inference.

Conclusion: ViTAD方法通过结合图分析和LLM技术，有效实现了RTL时序违规的自动化分析和修复，显著提升了修复成功率。

Abstract: In modern Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit design flow, the
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) stage presents a critical opportunity for timing
optimization. Addressing timing violations at this early stage is essential, as
modern systems demand higher speeds, where even minor timing violations can
lead to functional failures or system crashes. However, traditional timing
optimization heavily relies on manual expertise, requiring engineers to
iteratively analyze timing reports and debug. To automate this process, this
paper proposes ViTAD, a method that efficiently analyzes the root causes of
timing violations and dynamically generates targeted repair strategies.
Specifically, we first parse Verilog code and timing reports to construct a
Signal Timing Dependency Graph (STDG). Based on the STDG, we perform violation
path analysis and use large language models (LLMs) to infer the root causes of
violations. Finally, by analyzing the causes of violations, we selectively
retrieve relevant debugging knowledge from a domain-specific knowledge base to
generate customized repair solutions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we construct a timing violation dataset based on real-world open-source
projects. This dataset contains 54 cases of violations. Experimental results
show that our method achieves a 73.68% success rate in repairing timing
violations, while the baseline using only LLM is 54.38%. Our method improves
the success rate by 19.30%.

Conclusion: FedChip为AI硬件设计自动化提供了有效的隐私保护协作学习方案，显著提升设计质量并促进领域知识共享

Abstract: AI hardware design is advancing rapidly, driven by the promise of design
automation to make chip development faster, more efficient, and more accessible
to a wide range of users. Amongst automation tools, Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating and streamlining parts of the
design process. However, their potential is hindered by data privacy concerns
and the lack of domain-specific training. To address this, we introduce
FedChip, a Federated fine-tuning approach that enables multiple Chip design
parties to collaboratively enhance a shared LLM dedicated for automated
hardware design generation while protecting proprietary data. FedChip enables
parties to train the model on proprietary local data and improve the shared
LLM's performance. To exemplify FedChip's deployment, we create and release
APTPU-Gen, a dataset of 30k design variations spanning various performance
metric values such as power, performance, and area (PPA). To encourage the LLM
to generate designs that achieve a balance across multiple quality metrics, we

the quality of generated designs against predefined acceptance criteria.
Experimental results show that FedChip improves design quality by more than 77%
over high-end LLMs while maintaining data privacy

### [352] [Using Artificial Intuition in Distinct, Minimalist Classification of Scientific Abstracts for Management of Technology Portfolios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13182)
*Prateek Ranka,Fred Morstatter,Andrea Belz,Alexandra Graddy-Reed*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型生成元数据来复制专家标注方法，实现科学摘要分类，应用于研究组合管理和技术侦察等战略活动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学摘要分类对战略活动很有用但难以自动化，稀疏文本缺乏上下文线索，现有方法生成的标签缺乏区分度且容易重叠

Method: 应用人工直觉过程，使用大型语言模型生成元数据来复制专家方法，使用美国国家科学基金会的摘要创建标签集，并在中国国家自然科学基金会的摘要上进行测试

Result: 证明了该方法在研究组合管理、技术侦察和其他战略活动中的可行性

Conclusion: 基于大型语言模型的人工直觉方法能够有效解决科学摘要分类的挑战，为战略决策提供可靠支持

Abstract: Classification of scientific abstracts is useful for strategic activities but
challenging to automate because the sparse text provides few contextual clues.
Metadata associated with the scientific publication can be used to improve
performance but still often requires a semi-supervised setting. Moreover, such
schemes may generate labels that lack distinction -- namely, they overlap and
thus do not uniquely define the abstract. In contrast, experts label and sort
these texts with ease. Here we describe an application of a process we call
artificial intuition to replicate the expert's approach, using a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate metadata. We use publicly available abstracts from the
United States National Science Foundation to create a set of labels, and then
we test this on a set of abstracts from the Chinese National Natural Science
Foundation to examine funding trends. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
method for research portfolio management, technology scouting, and other
strategic activities.

### [353] [The Role of AI in Facilitating Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Evidence from AlphaFold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13234)
*Naixuan Zhao,Chunli Wei,Xinyan Zhang,Jiang Li*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: AI技术对跨学科合作的影响有限，AlphaFold仅使结构生物学-计算机科学合作增加0.48%，对其他学科无显著影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人工智能在跨学科合作中的作用机制和影响程度，特别是AlphaFold对结构生物学领域的影响

Method: 通过分析Scopus数据库中1,247篇AlphaFold相关论文和7,700位作者，采用文献计量分析和因果推断方法比较采用者与非采用者的跨学科合作模式

Result: AlphaFold仅使结构生物学与计算机科学的合作增加了0.48%，对其他学科合作没有可测量的影响

Conclusion: 人工智能单独使用在弥合学科鸿沟或促进有意义的跨学科合作方面效果有限，技术民主化等因素削弱了AI带来的跨学科合作需求

Abstract: The acceleration of artificial intelligence (AI) in science is recognized and
many scholars have begun to explore its role in interdisciplinary
collaboration. However, the mechanisms and extent of this impact are still
unclear. This study, using AlphaFold's impact on structural biologists,
examines how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary collaborative
patterns. By analyzing 1,247 AlphaFold-related papers and 7,700 authors from
Scopus, we employ bibliometric analysis and causal inference to compare
interdisciplinary collaboration between AlphaFold adopters and non-adopters.
Contrary to the widespread belief that AI facilitates interdisciplinary
collaboration, our findings show that AlphaFold increased structural
biology-computer science collaborations by just 0.48%, with no measurable
effect on other disciplines. Specifically, AI creates interdisciplinary
collaboration demands with specific disciplines due to its technical
characteristics, but this demand is weakened by technological democratization
and other factors. These findings demonstrate that artificial intelligence (AI)
alone has limited efficacy in bridging disciplinary divides or fostering
meaningful interdisciplinary collaboration.

### [354] [COMPASS: A Multi-Dimensional Benchmark for Evaluating Code Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13757)
*James Meaden,Michał Jarosz,Piotr Jodłowski,Grigori Melnik*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个多维代码生成评估框架，不仅评估功能正确性，还评估算法效率和代码质量，发现当前模型在效率和代码质量方面表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成基准主要关注功能正确性，忽略了真实编程中的算法效率和代码质量这两个关键方面

Method: 使用50个来自真实Codility竞赛的编程问题，收集393,150份人类提交作为基线，使用行业标准分析工具系统评估运行时效率和代码质量

Result: 评估三个领先的推理增强模型显示，获得高正确性分数的模型不一定能产生高效算法或可维护代码

Conclusion: 需要超越正确性评估来真正理解代码生成模型的真实能力，COMPASS为未来研究提供了指导框架

Abstract: Current code generation benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness
while overlooking two critical aspects of real-world programming: algorithmic
efficiency and code quality. We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional
Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses
code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality.
COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility
competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions.
Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions
identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS
systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using
industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading
reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and
OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do
not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These
findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to
truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS
serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI
systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 通过实现和评估DraCor的MCP服务器，研究大语言模型如何自主使用工具进行计算文学研究，强调文档工程对优化模型-工具交互的重要性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了让大语言模型能够自主与DraCor API进行交互，推动计算文学研究领域的自动化研究能力

Method: 实现DraCor的MCP服务器，进行实验研究，采用质性方法系统观察提示词，评估工具正确性、工具调用效率和工具使用可靠性三个指标

Result: 实验结果显示了文档工程（反射性制作工具文档）对优化LLM-工具交互的关键作用，以及自主AI在计算文学研究中的潜力

Conclusion: 研究既展示了自主AI在计算文学研究中的应用前景，也强调了建设可靠数字人文科学基础设施的必要性

Abstract: This paper reports on the implementation and evaluation of a Model Context
Protocol (MCP) server for DraCor, enabling Large Language Models (LLM) to
autonomously interact with the DraCor API. We conducted experiments focusing on
tool selection and application by the LLM, employing a qualitative approach
that includes systematic observation of prompts to understand how LLMs behave
when using MCP tools, evaluating "Tool Correctness", "Tool-Calling Efficiency",
and "Tool-Use Reliability". Our findings highlight the importance of "Docstring
Engineering", defined as reflexively crafting tool documentation to optimize
LLM-tool interaction. Our experiments demonstrate both the promise of agentic
AI for research in Computational Literary Studies and the essential
infrastructure development needs for reliable Digital Humanities
infrastructures.

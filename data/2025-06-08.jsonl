Scholars suggest that OEE requires\nan \"open\" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its\nenvironment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical\ninfrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational\nsubstrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on\nblockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus\nprimarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,\nWorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal\nand semantic abstraction.

To address these issues, we introduce\nGen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer\nDiffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks\nand diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt\nagent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground\ninstance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the\ngeneration of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and\nclean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out\nlow-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are\nrefined through TextGrad.

To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning\nin spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated\naudio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks.

Project Page:\n  https://research.nvidia.com/labs/dir/hmar/", "summary": "Visual Auto-Regressive modeling (VAR) has shown promise in bridging the speed\nand quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR\nreformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive\nresolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop\nefficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve\nfaster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5x and 1.75x\nrespectively, as well as over 3x lower inference memory footprint. Finally,\nHMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; its sampling schedule can be\nchanged without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks\nin a zero-shot manner."}

We compare transitive inference behavior\nacross two distinct learning regimes: in-weights learning (IWL), where models\nstore information in network parameters, and in-context learning (ICL), where\nmodels flexibly utilize information presented within the input sequence. Our\nfindings reveal that IWL naturally induces a generalization bias towards\ntransitive inference, despite being trained only on adjacent items, whereas ICL\nmodels trained solely on adjacent items do not generalize transitively.\nMechanistic analysis shows that ICL models develop induction circuits that\nimplement a simple match-and-copy strategy that performs well at relating\nadjacent pairs, but does not encoding hierarchical relationships among\nindirectly related items.

Our research shows that equipment issues are slightly\nmore common than human-related ones, but human-related incidents are more often\nfatal. Specifically, pedals, tires, and brakes are frequent contributors to\naccidents. The model achieves a high weighted F1 score of 0.87 in\nclassification accuracy, highlighting the potential of using LLMs to extract\nunstructured data in niche domains, such as transportation.

Using these datasets, we systematically compare 14 protein\nmodels including masked language models, autoregressive language models,\ninverse folding models, diffusion-based generative models, and geometric graph\nmodels. The correlation between model likelihood and experimental affinity\nvalues is used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, in a case study to\nincrease binding affinity of antibody F045-092 to antigen influenza H1N1, we\nevaluate the generative power of the top-performing models by sampling a set of\nnew antibodies binding to the antigen and ranking them based on structural\nintegrity and biophysical properties of the Ab-Ag complex. As a result,\nstructure-conditioned inverse folding models outperform others in both affinity\ncorrelation and generation tasks. Overall, AbBiBench provides a unified,\nbiologically grounded evaluation framework to facilitate the development of\nmore effective, function-aware antibody design models."}

Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web\nwith guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they\ncould become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the\nrepresentation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set.

In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal\nobject representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings\n(e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric\nand visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the\ncaptured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding\nfusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned\nembedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also\nsupporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image\n3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view\nsynthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly\nimproving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive\nperformance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization.\nCritically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less\nstorage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches,\nestablishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for\nmulti-modal 3D scene representation."}

However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically\ninconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to\ndetect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on\nanswer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical\ninconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is\nparticularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not\nonly an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key\nsource of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and\nAnswer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for\nhallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential\nreasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency\nof reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment\nbetween reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint\nanalysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final\nanswer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs\ndemonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,\noffering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is\navailable at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE."}

Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level\ncompetitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM\nreasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent\nICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key\ncontributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring\na problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)\nA robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation\ntoolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective\ntest-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of\nsolutions based on execution feedback.

During inference, an image is generated by predicting all\nthe tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in\nall previous (lower-resolution) scales. However, this formulation suffers from\nreduced image quality due to the parallel generation of all tokens in a\nresolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image\nresolution; and requires retraining to change the sampling schedule.\n  We introduce Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive modeling (HMAR), a new image\ngeneration algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction\nand masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On\nImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform\nparameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines.

Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to\narticulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each\nreasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We\nevaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various\nmathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement\nwhile offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose\n$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$\nformal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first\nendeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural\nlanguage content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal\nmathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust\nfoundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs."}

Instead of sequential optimization,\ndirectly optimizing all parameters at the same time also fails due to the\nhighly non-convex and often non-differentiable nature of the problem. We\npropose ProJo4D, a progressive joint optimization framework that gradually\nincreases the set of jointly optimized parameters guided by their sensitivity,\nleading to fully joint optimization over geometry, appearance, physical state,\nand material property. Evaluations on PAC-NeRF and Spring-Gaus datasets show\nthat ProJo4D outperforms prior work in 4D future state prediction, novel view\nrendering of future state, and material parameter estimation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in physically grounded 4D scene understanding.

For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets\nMaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by\ntext and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate\nsuperior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring\nexpression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation\n(GRES) tasks.

To this end, we present grafting, a simple\napproach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize\nnew architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of\nactivation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the\nDiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this\ntestbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax\nattention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and\nreplacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants.\nNotably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38-2.64 vs. 2.27 for\nDiT-XL/2) using <2% pretraining compute.

It requires interpreting\nfine-grained visual information, accurately reading handwritten or digital\ntext, and integrating spoken cues, often dispersed non-linearly over time. In\nsuch multimodal contexts, success hinges not just on perception, but on\nselectively identifying and integrating the right contextual details from a\nrich and noisy stream of content. To this end, we introduce VideoMathQA, a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate whether models can perform such temporally\nextended cross-modal reasoning on videos. The benchmark spans 10 diverse\nmathematical domains, covering videos ranging from 10 seconds to over 1 hour.\nIt requires models to interpret structured visual content, understand\ninstructional narratives, and jointly ground concepts across visual, audio, and\ntextual modalities. We employ graduate-level experts to ensure high quality,\ntotaling over $920$ man-hours of annotation. To reflect real-world scenarios,\nquestions are designed around three core reasoning challenges: direct problem\nsolving, where answers are grounded in the presented question; conceptual\ntransfer, which requires applying learned methods to new problems; and deep\ninstructional comprehension, involving multi-step reasoning over extended\nexplanations and partially worked-out solutions. Each question includes\nmulti-step reasoning annotations, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of model\ncapabilities. Through this benchmark, we highlight the limitations of existing\napproaches and establish a systematic evaluation framework for models that must\nreason, rather than merely perceive, across temporally extended and\nmodality-rich mathematical problem settings.

A key limitation of existing\nadversarial training approaches lies in their reliance on a fixed perturbation\nbudget, which fails to account for instance-specific robustness\ncharacteristics. While prior works such as IAAT and MMA introduce\ninstance-level adaptations, they often rely on heuristic or static\napproximations of data robustness. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Epsilon\nScheduling (DES), a novel framework that adaptively adjusts the adversarial\nperturbation budget per instance and per training iteration. DES integrates\nthree key factors: (1) the distance to the decision boundary approximated via\ngradient-based proxies, (2) prediction confidence derived from softmax entropy,\nand (3) model uncertainty estimated via Monte Carlo dropout. By combining these\ncues into a unified scheduling strategy, DES tailors the perturbation budget\ndynamically to guide more effective adversarial learning. Experimental results\non CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that our method consistently improves both\nadversarial robustness and standard accuracy compared to fixed-epsilon\nbaselines and prior adaptive methods.

In practice, pre-training has been\nrelying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available\non the internet so far.

Furthermore, the availability of high-quality\ntexts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of\nthe initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\"\nof pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data\ndiscarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web\nwith guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they\ncould become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the\nrepresentation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at\n1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw\ntexts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points\nimprovement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only\nfiltered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more\neffective than having access to 2x web data.

An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team\nstability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes\nautonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like\nacademic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a\nJailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash\non GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate\nHASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via\nautonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management.\nHASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable\nMAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence,\nand autonomous functional extension.

Another approach, where LLMs directly propose tasks\nto learn, is often invalid, as the LLMs lack knowledge of which tasks are\nactually feasible.

Crucially, we incorporate an iterative feedback loop, where Alice\nevaluates Bob's performance to identify areas for improvement. This feedback\nthen guides Alice's next round of exploration, forming a closed-loop data\ngeneration process.

In contrast to prior benchmarks that focus\nprimarily on low-level world modeling and robotic motion planning,\nWorldPrediction is the first benchmark that emphasizes actions with temporal\nand semantic abstraction. Given initial and final world states, the task is to\ndistinguish the proper action (WorldPrediction-WM) or the properly ordered\nsequence of actions (WorldPrediction-PP) from a set of counterfactual\ndistractors. This discriminative task setup enable us to evaluate different\ntypes of world models and planners and realize a thorough comparison across\ndifferent hypothesis. The benchmark represents states and actions using visual\nobservations. In order to prevent models from exploiting low-level continuity\ncues in background scenes, we provide \"action equivalents\" - identical actions\nobserved in different contexts - as candidates for selection. This benchmark is\ngrounded in a formal framework of partially observable semi-MDP, ensuring\nbetter reliability and robustness of the evaluation. We conduct extensive human\nfiltering and validation on our benchmark and show that current frontier models\nbarely achieve 57% accuracy on WorldPrediction-WM and 38% on WorldPrediction-PP\nwhereas humans are able to solve both tasks perfectly."}

In this paper, we propose FALO, a hardware-friendly\napproach to LiDAR 3D detection, which offers both state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ndetection accuracy and fast inference speed. More specifically, given the 3D\npoint cloud and after voxelization, FALO first arranges sparse 3D voxels into a\n1D sequence based on their coordinates and proximity. The sequence is then\nprocessed by our proposed ConvDotMix blocks, consisting of large-kernel\nconvolutions, Hadamard products, and linear layers. ConvDotMix provides\nsufficient mixing capability in both spatial and embedding dimensions, and\nintroduces higher-order nonlinear interaction among spatial features.\nFurthermore, when going through the ConvDotMix layers, we introduce implicit\ngrouping, which balances the tensor dimensions for more efficient inference and\ntakes into account the growing receptive field. All these operations are\nfriendly to run on resource-constrained platforms and proposed FALO can readily\ndeploy on compact, embedded devices. Our extensive evaluation on LiDAR 3D\ndetection benchmarks such as nuScenes and Waymo shows that FALO achieves\ncompetitive performance.

We conducted\npreliminary tests with 10 users on various terrains, including carpet and\nslate, to assess PulseRide's effectiveness. Our findings show that, for\nindividual users, PulseRide maintains heart rates within the moderate activity\nzone as much as 71.7 percent longer than manual wheelchairs. Among all users,\nwe observed an average reduction in muscle contractions of 41.86 percent,\ndelaying fatigue onset and enhancing overall comfort and engagement. These\nresults indicate that PulseRide offers a healthier, adaptive mobility solution,\nbridging the gap between passive and physically taxing mobility options."}

Drawing inspiration from human\nmetacognition, we introduce a formal framework comprising three components:\nmetacognitive knowledge (self-assessment of capabilities, tasks, and learning\nstrategies), metacognitive planning (deciding what and how to learn), and\nmetacognitive evaluation (reflecting on learning experiences to improve future\nlearning). Analyzing existing self-improving agents, we find they rely\npredominantly on extrinsic metacognitive mechanisms, which are fixed,\nhuman-designed loops that limit scalability and adaptability.

In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative\nEmergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.\nThe C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power\nand SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning\nframework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a\nMixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based\ncontinue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without\nretraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets\ndemonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,\neffectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous\nemergent fake news scenarios."}

We formalize an agentic workflow as a directed\nacyclic graph, called an agent graph, where edges represent AI agents and paths\ncorrespond to feasible compositions of agents. When deploying these systems in\nthe real world, we need to choose compositions of agents that not only maximize\nthe task success, but also minimize risk where the risk captures requirements\nlike safety, fairness, and privacy. This additionally requires carefully\nanalyzing the low-probability (tail) behaviors of compositions of agents. In\nthis work, we consider worst-case risk minimization over the set of feasible\nagent compositions. We define worst-case risk as the tail quantile -- also\nknown as value-at-risk -- of the loss distribution of the agent composition\nwhere the loss quantifies the risk associated with agent behaviors. We\nintroduce an efficient algorithm that traverses the agent graph and finds a\nnear-optimal composition of agents by approximating the value-at-risk via a\nunion bound and dynamic programming. Furthermore, we prove that the\napproximation is near-optimal asymptotically for a broad class of practical\nloss functions. To evaluate our framework, we consider a suite of video\ngame-like control benchmarks that require composing several agents trained with\nreinforcement learning and demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness in\napproximating the value-at-risk and identifying the optimal agent composition."}

Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess\nstudent knowledge, but manually generating these questions is\nresource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our\nopinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper\npresents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,\nMistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and\nchallenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,\nbut we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,\ngiving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment\ninvolving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs\nacross several known metrics.

Personalizing certain\nparts of the model can effectively address these issues by allowing those parts\nto differ across clients, while the remaining parts serve as a shared model.\nHowever, we found that partial model personalization may exacerbate client\ndrift (each client's local model diverges from the shared model), thereby\nreducing the effectiveness and efficiency of FL algorithms. We propose an FL\nframework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM),\nreferred to as FedAPM, to mitigate client drift. We construct the augmented\nLagrangian function by incorporating first-order and second-order proximal\nterms into the objective, with the second-order term providing fixed correction\nand the first-order term offering compensatory correction between the local and\nshared models. Our analysis demonstrates that FedAPM, by using explicit\nestimates of the Lagrange multiplier, is more stable and efficient in terms of\nconvergence compared to other FL frameworks. We establish the global\nconvergence of FedAPM training from arbitrary initial points to a stationary\npoint, achieving three types of rates: constant, linear, and sublinear, under\nmild assumptions. We conduct experiments using four heterogeneous and\nmultimodal datasets with different metrics to validate the performance of\nFedAPM. Specifically, FedAPM achieves faster and more accurate convergence,\noutperforming the SOTA methods with average improvements of 12.3% in test\naccuracy, 16.4% in F1 score, and 18.0% in AUC while requiring fewer\ncommunication rounds."}

HMAR\nreformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein the\nprediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its\nimmediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions.\nWhen predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked\ngeneration procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step.

Following this, subsequent improvements have come from\nreinterpreting the regression task as a classification problem\n\\cite{bhat2021adabins,Li_Wang_Liu_Jiang_2022}, incorporating additional priors\n\\cite{shao2023nddepth,yang2023gedepth}, and developing more effective objective\nfunction \\cite{xian2020structure,Yin_Liu_Shen_Yan_2019}. Despite these\nadvances, generalizing to unseen domains remains a challenge. Recently, several\nmethods have employed affine-invariant loss to enable multi-dataset joint\ntraining \\cite{MiDaS,ZeroDepth,guizilini2023towards,Dany}. Among them, Depth\nAnything \\cite{Dany} has shown leading performance in zero-shot monocular depth\nestimation.

While\nprevious explanations attribute these phenomena to the lower-loss-as-sharper\ncharacteristics of the loss landscape, our analysis reveals that Adam's\nadaptive preconditioners themselves can trigger spikes. Specifically, we\nidentify a critical regime where squared gradients become substantially smaller\nthan the second-order moment estimates, causing the latter to undergo a\n$\\beta_2$-exponential decay and to respond sluggishly to current gradient\ninformation. This mechanism can push the maximum eigenvalue of the\npreconditioned Hessian beyond the classical stability threshold $2/\\eta$ for a\nsustained period, inducing instability.

In detail, the range-time map and Doppler-time map of TWR are\nfirst generated. Then, the initial regions of the human target foreground and\nnoise background on the maps are determined using corner detection method, and\nthe micro-Doppler signature is segmented using the multiphase active contour\nmodel. The micro-Doppler segmentation feature is discretized into a\ntwo-dimensional point cloud. Finally, the topological similarity between the\nresulting point cloud and the point clouds of the template data is calculated\nusing Mapper algorithm to obtain the recognition results. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed method is demonstrated by numerical simulated and measured\nexperiments.

We formulate this challenge as a combinatorial optimization\nproblem, leveraging a novel network performance analysis mechanism.

For the first time, full scaling laws based on\ndense measurements across a wide span of model and samples seen scales are\nderived for two important language-vision learning procedures, CLIP and MaMMUT,\nthat use either contrastive only or contrastive and captioning text generative\nloss.

However, the\nlikelihood displacement observed in DPO indicates that both $\\log \\pi_\\theta\n(y_w\\mid x)$ and $\\log \\pi_\\theta (y_l\\mid x) $ often decrease during training,\ninadvertently boosting the probabilities of non-target responses. In this\npaper, we systematically revisit this phenomenon from LLMs to Video-LLMs,\nshowing that it intensifies when dealing with the redundant complexity of video\ncontent. To alleviate the impact of this phenomenon, we propose \\emph{Lean\nPreference Optimization} (LeanPO), a reference-free approach that reformulates\nthe implicit reward as the average likelihood of the response with respect to\nthe policy model. A key component of LeanPO is the reward-trustworthiness\ncorrelated self-generated preference data pipeline, which carefully infuses\nrelevant prior knowledge into the model while continuously refining the\npreference data via self-reflection. This allows the policy model to obtain\nhigh-quality paired data and accurately estimate the newly defined reward, thus\nmitigating the unintended drop. In addition, we introduce a dynamic label\nsmoothing strategy that mitigates the impact of noise in responses from diverse\nvideo content, preventing the model from overfitting to spurious details.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that LeanPO significantly enhances the\nperformance of state-of-the-art Video-LLMs, consistently boosting baselines of\nvarying capacities with minimal additional training overhead. Moreover, LeanPO\noffers a simple yet effective solution for aligning Video-LLM preferences with\nhuman trustworthiness, paving the way toward the reliable and efficient\nVideo-LLMs."}

This can\nbe both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we\nexplore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse\nretrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel\nfusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse\nretrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query\nexpansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval\nroutes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented\nquery. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses\nthem using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive\nevaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and\nadvanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven\nlow-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only\nsurpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse\nretrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves\nSOTA results on several benchmarks.

This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of\nnested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers\nfine-grained controls for both narrative size \\emph{and} reasoning difficulty.\nWhilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically\nexpanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints\na specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested\nsub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our\nexperiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse\nin performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,\ndespite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is\nparamount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key\nreasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering\nirrelevant information.

Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,\nspanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,\nscene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,\nVideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and\nsupports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video\ncomprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and\nefficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables\nhour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory\naugmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and\nspatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our\nexperiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long\nvideo-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon\ndataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model."}

These features are typically useful for robust\nclassification, which we offer theoretical evidence to illustrate through a\nsynthetic data model. Through systematic studies across multiple model\narchitectures and settings, we find that during the initial stage of AT, the\nmodel tends to learn more cross-class features until the best robustness\ncheckpoint. As AT further squeezes the training robust loss and causes robust\noverfitting, the model tends to make decisions based on more class-specific\nfeatures. Based on these discoveries, we further provide a unified view of two\nexisting properties of AT, including the advantage of soft-label training and\nrobust overfitting. Overall, these insights refine the current understanding of\nAT mechanisms and provide new perspectives on studying them.

These comparisons are represented as actionable\nsteps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive\nexperiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves\nsignificant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all\n5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types\nwhere all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits\nrobust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its\npractical value in real-world RAG applications."}

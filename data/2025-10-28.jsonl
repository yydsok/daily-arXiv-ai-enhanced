When such\nconnectivity is lacking, users often default to audio-only communication, a\nmode that significantly disadvantages American Sign Language (ASL) users, whose\ncommunication relies on hand gestures, body movement, and facial expressions.\nIn this work, we introduce VC4ASL, a system designed to enable ASL\ncommunication over the audio channel of existing video conferencing\napplications, even in the absence of reliable video. VC4ASL integrates\nseamlessly with current platforms without requiring any modifications. Our\napproach establishes a communication channel through audio by encoding and\ntransmitting human pose information, which is then rendered to reconstruct\nsigned content. We propose novel receive-side error detection and correction\nmechanisms that exploit the inherent structural constraints of human pose data.\nTo evaluate the system, we simulate network-degraded environments, generate\npose-based ASL video sequences, and conduct user studies to assess\ncomprehension among ASL users.

Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M\nconverges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on\nlanguage modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M\nconsistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various\ndownstream benchmarks.

We can\nretrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while\nholding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.\nWe argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build\nand refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that\nspecify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.\nExplanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be\nindependently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce\ncomputational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready\ncausal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured\nCausal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy\nfunctions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and\ninterventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes\ninternal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which\nrelations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We\nprovide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM\nin the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization\nsystematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we\nanalyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs.

We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO\nframework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed\nPGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where\neach action refines a single edge's pose estimate.

Although deep\nlearning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable\nlimitations.

Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent\nrandomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and\nrarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation\nnowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are\ninherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the\nCritical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it\nchallenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both\nmetrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference\noptimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the\nsuccess of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.\nSpecifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage\npost-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization\n(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently\nachieve superior performance.

The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field.

A critical factor in building such\nassistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.\nActivation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user\npreference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a\ncost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,\nexisting methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,\nignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines\nthe personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled\nsteering method that isolates preference-driven components from\npreference-agnostic components.

Moreover, recent\nzero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance\non prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as\nwell as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that\nbuilds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from\nunstructured texts.

Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal\nRelational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures\nbetween multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely\nunder-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on\nsuch data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge\nthe dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement\nmethodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An\nautomatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build\nmulti-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for\nvarious STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement\ntraining framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to\ndifferent STAR tasks.

This\nmeans potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling\nfaces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be\nconditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence\npredictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often\ncluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.\n  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our\nmethod identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from\nconflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy\nboth independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved\nparallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.\n  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy\nand compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially\nfor generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to\n16\\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation\n(one-by-one).

Existing methods\ntypically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep\nneural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across\nmodalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a\nlow-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible\nmultimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned\nproblem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance\nrepresentation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize\nincomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for\ncross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we\nmodel and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible\nstructure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow\nmodel, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent\nspace of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the\nreconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight\nTransformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating\nthe overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the\nlow-rank Transformer.

The model constructs a compact scene\nrepresentation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,\nand evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon\nreasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight\ntemporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the\nLLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and\ncommonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to\ndecompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across\nscenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer\nagent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts.

It is crucial to control the\nsubstrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an\noptimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,\nit takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is\nfinally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into\nthe tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a\nheating zone and the consolidation unit.

The resulting model unifies index prediction and\nconstrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,\nenabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is\noptimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper\nbound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory\nwith practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance\nwithin 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing\nheterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a\ngeneral, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning\nindex-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments."}

We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by\npositing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level\nstructured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby\nbypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through\na systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we\ntested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of\nboth.

We\nthen explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service\nrobots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and\ndecision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning\nacross various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,\nand multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in\ncurrent research and propose future directions to advance the task planning\ncapabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.\nThis review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and\npractitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics."}

This paper presents the first systematic comparison\nof commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for\nhuman-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the\ncost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across\n78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four\ninstruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,\nGPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both\nstandard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:\nCalibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),\nand Language Stability Score (LSS).

In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a\nsocially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a\nstructured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM\nconsists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that\ncaptures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the\nenvironment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a\nmulti-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot\nto generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and\nphysically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,\ncollision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or\nfine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling\ninterpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves\nsuccess rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded\nenvironments.

To realize this shift,\nemotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues\nunderlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for\npredicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.\nHowever, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that\ndiverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own\npredicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for\nmisunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address\nthis, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and\nan Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is\nexplicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion\nrecognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional\npaired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves\nfaithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on\nthe MAFW and DFEW datasets.

This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling\nMachine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these\ncritical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial\nIntelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the\nuncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as\nopposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby\nempowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from\noverconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.\n  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network\n(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief\nfunctions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty\nthrough the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including\nits adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather\nclassification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a\nunified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers.

These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's\nrobustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical\nobservations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test\ngraph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it\nin heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance\nof pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training\nor update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural\ntransformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.\nSpecifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,\nfacilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the\nconfidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine\nbenchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate\nthat GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements of up to 10.92%.

Image watermarking for diffusion\nmodels, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as\nspecific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the\ninfomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the\ngeneration process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing\nthe watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to\nbalance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve\nstrong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which\ndegrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile\nfor real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a\ntwo-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike\nprior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances\nrobustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while\nrandomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our\ntwo-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly\ngenerated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on\ndiffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show\nthat it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity.

Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data\nvisualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.\nAre VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the\ndata visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the\nvision and language modules, or how information is processed within the\nlanguage module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the\ncoordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often\nlead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the\ncorrect coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when\nthe model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be\nsuccessfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,\nsuggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.\nWe further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks\ninvolving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens\nperformance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across\nmany data points.

Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were\ntrained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative\naspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects\n(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.\n  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\\% sensitivity on a\nheld-out test set.

Due to the complexity of event structures,\ntraditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not\nwell-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical\nattention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the\nrelationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial\nrelationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA\nvideo prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the\ncomplexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms\nall these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for\nreplicating the experiments and annotations."}

Furthermore, the embedding controls can be\nalgorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to\nenhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global\nrepresentation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks\nwith diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\\% performance improvement under\nsevere data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical\nanalysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical\nobservations.

However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense\nannotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character\nrecognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to\nvaried layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address\nthese challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the\nautomated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern\ndetection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det\nperforms layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title\nblocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,\nfine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and\nsurface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free\nVLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and\ncategorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM\ninterprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface\nroughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and\ngeneralization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for\nannotation-level training.

One weakness of AL is the need\nfor labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain\nexpertise to generate.

The most prominent techniques\nrely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased\ncode complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an\nRL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an\nRL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a\ntraining set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the\nperformance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal\nstrategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point.

Diffusion modeling starts by defining a\nforward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data\ndistribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate\ndistributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise\nback into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three\ncomplementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational\nautoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The\nscore-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the\nevolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely\nregions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation\nas following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a\nlearned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a\ntime-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.\nSampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise\ninto data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph\ndiscusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,\nand diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between\narbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded\nunderstanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning\nknowledge."}

Yet many strong contemporary\nmodels are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,\nhigh-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt\nsensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we\nintroduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds\non a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware\ndetection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts\ndegradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates\ntrue spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive\ntargeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy\nratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across\nbenchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet\nconsistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE\n0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy."}

To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses\ntool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as\namplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams.

At first glance, these approaches may appear quite\ndifferent--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient\nfilter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer\nproducts of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it\nensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby\nsimplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly\nfrom quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and\nnon-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,\nalthough not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor\nconstruction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,\nprovided they are sufficiently concentrated."}

To\novercome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that\nunifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide\nembeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a\ncorpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained\nmorphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and\nflexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)\nmosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide\nresearch; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly\nretrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public\npathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including\nanatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,\nand grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and\nstomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional\nimage-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further\ndemonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,\nand enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical\nscenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable\nretrieval solution for digital pathology."}

Many data mining applications perform\noutlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers\nand build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier\ndetection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal\noutlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier\ndetection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of\ndomain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed\nto represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify\noutliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an\nadvantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are\nfounded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been\nevaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from\ntwo different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying\nbalance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a\nneurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate\nthe proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in\nterms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal\nis useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false\npositive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%."}

Our key innovation lies in\nsuperseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,\nwhich inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming\ntraditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,\naugmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not\nonly improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise\nimmunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration\nand derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded\ninto a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the\npower of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other\nstate-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability."}

Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current\nMCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component\nCause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate\nsufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of\nleading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free\nand compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical\nresults demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness\nacross a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks.

To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts\npre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable\nprompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph\nprompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,\nthey often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation.

This work introduces the first multilingual\nTSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and\nSpanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a\nmultilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our\nmodel pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased\ndifficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and\nhighlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck.

It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes\nback from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI\nadvances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the\nintermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal\nconnections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated\ncausal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for\nhow long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically\nrigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The\nforward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR\ntraces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal\npredictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase,\nrespectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced,\neliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient\napproximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the\nuse of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems.

For efficient deployment on\nedge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while\nmaintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy\nIMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS\npositions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both\nroad and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative\nand ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control\nin our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves\ncompetitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only\nheading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.\nOverall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to\nmore versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we\nwill release the codes to our GitHub repository at\nhttps://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC."}

However, designing such augmentations\nrequires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational\ninvariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we\npropose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces\naugmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete\nframes. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete\nspaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced\nby representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the\ncomplementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves\nsuperior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through\nstrong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine\ndatasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific\ncharacteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without\nrelying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance\ngains of up to 15--20\\% over existing self-supervised approaches.

To address this,\nwe propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,\nmulti-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We\nconstruct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop\nMAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact\nimportance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form\ntexts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain\nhigher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our\nwork provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual\nreliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in\nsensitive domains."}

To\naddress this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning\nincrease tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,\na diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)\nno tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled\nexperiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal\nrelationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool\nhallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect\ntranscends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still\namplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,\nappearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is\nmerely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step\nthinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering\nand Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental\nreliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades\nutility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses\ntool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as\namplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These\nfindings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify\ntool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that\njointly optimize for capability and reliability."}

(3) With integer-only\nquantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.\nA ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability\nunder tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework\nto support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering\naccuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two\nswipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach\nachieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25\nFPGA.

The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep\nstructural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.\nTo enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage\nRefinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative\ngeneration from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline\ninto rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a\nprofessionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to\nspecialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in\nimplementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data.

PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between\nactivation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability\nanalysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.\nTherefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated\ncomponents while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.\nPAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\\% and memory consumption by\nup to 30\\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.\nImportantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit\ndiscovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This\ntraining-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating\nmechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/626619403/PAHQ."}

We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a\nresource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score\nperformance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical\nimage segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score\nperformance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a\nnotable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves\nupon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically\nsignificant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score.

It drives\nefficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by\nassigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation\nmethods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating\nchanges in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as\nopposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different\npatterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods\nbased on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when\nthe validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware\nmethods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical\ndeployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),\na plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an\nID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral\napproximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and\nOOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then\nestimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via\nperturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV\nplugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional\ntraining loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and\nstable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining\ncomputationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for\nlarge-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to\nOOD-robust data valuation."}

However, they often fail to preserve the semantic\nidentity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation\nmethods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as\nPersonalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content\nthat align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D\ngeneration is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE\n(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.\nIt takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as\ninput and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.\nThen, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling\nthe identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view\nobservations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency.

However, a key limitation of standard masked\ndiffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens\nthat are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when\ndependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among\ntokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that\nintroduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through\ncontrolled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD\nsuccessfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to\ncapture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku\npuzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves\nglobal consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality\nand dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational\ninference into masked diffusion.

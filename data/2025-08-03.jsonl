Although existing research mainly focuses on\ndesigning complex model architectures to handle incomplete data, it still faces\nsignificant challenges in effectively aligning and fusing multimodal\ninformation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Hybrid\nCNN-Mamba Enhancement Network (HCMEN) for robust multimodal sentiment analysis\nunder missing modality conditions. HCMEN is designed around three key\ncomponents: (1) hierarchical unimodal modeling, (2) cross-modal enhancement and\nalignment, and (3) multimodal mix-up fusion. First, HCMEN integrates the\nstrengths of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for capturing local details and\nthe Mamba architecture for modeling global contextual dependencies across\ndifferent modalities. Furthermore, grounded in the principle of Mutual\nInformation Maximization, we introduce a cross-modal enhancement mechanism that\ngenerates proxy modalities from mixed token-level representations and learns\nfine-grained token-level correspondences between modalities. The enhanced\nunimodal features are then fused and passed through the CNN-Mamba backbone,\nenabling local-to-global cross-modal interaction and comprehensive multimodal\nintegration. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MSA datasets demonstrate\nthat HCMEN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving superior performance across various missing modality scenarios. The\ncode will be released publicly in the near future."}

The classification pipeline operates in\ntwo stages.

We introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,\nand (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action\nencoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B\nparameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.\nExtensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,\nsingle-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and\nrobustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from\nscratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving\nsignificant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in\nsimulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our\ncore hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation\nfor learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies."}

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band.

To address this limitation, we\npropose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate\nthe structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight\nstandardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error\nexistence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type\nclassification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset\ngenerated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical\ndistributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs\nreveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding\ncapabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible\nthrough traditional metrics."}

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations. While primarily\ndeveloped through human social systems, this framework also illuminates a new\npathway for analyzing explainability in advanced artificial intelligence\nsystems."}

Multivariate curve resolution\n(MCR), a branch of signal unmixing, separates mixed chemical signals into base\npatterns (components) and their concentrations, playing a key role in\nunderstanding composition. Classical MCR is typically framed as matrix\nfactorization (MF) and requires a user-specified component count, usually\nunknown in real data. As dataset size or component count increases, the\nscalability and reliability of MF-based MCR face significant challenges. This\nstudy reformulates MCR as a generative process (gMCR), and introduces an\nenergy-based deep learning solver, EB-gMCR, that automatically discovers the\nsmallest component set able to reconstruct the data faithfully. EB-gMCR starts\nfrom a large candidate pool (e.g., 1024 spectra) and employs a differentiable\ngating network to retain only active components while estimating their\nconcentrations. On noisy synthetic datasets containing up to 256 latent\nsources, EB-gMCR maintained R^2 >= 0.98 and recovered the component count\nwithin 5% of the ground truth; at lower noise it achieved R^2 >= 0.99 with near\nexact component estimation. Additional chemical priors, such as non-negativity\nor nonlinear mixing, enter as simple plug-in functions, enabling adaptation to\nother instruments or domains without altering the core learning process.

In the differentiation study, participants achieved 53.9%\naccuracy (95% CI: 50.7%-57.1%) in distinguishing between human and AI-generated\nreports, with radiologists performing significantly better (56.9%, 95% CI:\n53.3%-60.6%, p<0.05) than other groups. Conclusion: PARROT represents the\nlargest open multilingual radiology report dataset, enabling development and\nvalidation of natural language processing applications across linguistic,\ngeographic, and clinical boundaries without privacy constraints."}

In this work, we propose Causal2Vec, a general-purpose\nembedding model tailored to enhance the performance of decoder-only LLMs\nwithout altering their original architectures or introducing significant\ncomputational overhead. Specifically, we first employ a lightweight BERT-style\nmodel to pre-encode the input text into a single Contextual token, which is\nthen prepended to the LLM's input sequence, allowing each token to capture\ncontextualized information even without attending to future tokens.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the recency bias introduced by last-token pooling and\nhelp LLMs better leverage the semantic information encoded in the Contextual\ntoken, we concatenate the last hidden states of Contextual and EOS tokens as\nthe final text embedding.

However, the main drawback of softmax attention is the\nquadratic memory requirement and computational complexity with respect to the\nsequence length. By replacing the softmax nonlinearity, linear attention and\nsimilar methods have been introduced to avoid the quadratic bottleneck of\nsoftmax attention. Despite these linear forms of attention being derived from\nthe original softmax formulation, they typically lag in terms of downstream\naccuracy. While strong intuition of the softmax nonlinearity on the query and\nkey inner product suggests that it has desirable properties compared to other\nnonlinearities, the question of why this discrepancy exists still remains\nunanswered. This work demonstrates that linear attention is an approximation of\nsoftmax attention by deriving the recurrent form of softmax attention.

Diverging from critical traditions that conflate\narbitrariness with injustice, it posits arbitrariness as a semiotic trait: a\nproperty enabling systems - linguistic, legal, or social - to operate\neffectively while withholding their internal rationale. Building on Ferdinand\nde Saussure's concept of l'arbitraire du signe, the analysis extends this\nprinciple beyond language to demonstrate its cross-domain applicability,\nparticularly in law and social dynamics. The paper introduces the \"Motivation\n-> Constatability -> Contestability\" chain, arguing that motivation functions\nas a crucial interface rendering an act's logic vulnerable to intersubjective\ncontestation. When this chain is broken through mechanisms like\n\"immotivization\" or \"Conflict Lateralization\" (exemplified by \"the blur of the\nwolf drowned in the fish\"), acts produce binding effects without exposing their\nrationale, thus precluding justiciability. This structural opacity, while\nappearing illogical, is a deliberate design protecting authority from\naccountability. Drawing on Shannon's entropy model, the paper formalizes\narbitrariness as A = H(L|M) (conditional entropy). It thereby proposes a modern\ntheory of arbitrariness as a neutral operator central to control as well as\ncare, an overlooked dimension of interpersonal relations.

This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue.

In this work, we\nintroduce a new paradigm for automatic label placement (ALP) that formulates\nthe task as a data editing problem and leverages large language models (LLMs)\nfor context-aware spatial annotation. To support this direction, we curate\nMAPLE, the first known benchmarking dataset for evaluating ALP on real-world\nmaps, encompassing diverse landmark types and label placement annotations from\nopen-source data. Our method retrieves labeling guidelines relevant to each\nlandmark type leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrates them\ninto prompts, and employs instruction-tuned LLMs to generate ideal label\ncoordinates. We evaluate four open-source LLMs on MAPLE, analyzing both overall\nperformance and generalization across different types of landmarks.

Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it\nfirst generates device control logic by progressively retrieving\ndevice-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code\nusing platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a\nmulti-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT\ndevice testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires\nonly binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We\nevaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT\nplatforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average\nsuccess rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any\nhuman involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code\nis then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15\nparticipants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by\n50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use\ncommercial code LLMs."}

Among existing methods, influence-based unlearning has\nemerged as a prominent approach due to its ability to estimate the impact of\nindividual training samples on model parameters without retraining. However,\nthis approach suffers from prohibitive computational overhead arising from the\nnecessity to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse across all training\nsamples and parameters, rendering it impractical for large-scale models and\nscenarios involving frequent data deletion requests. This highlights the\ndifficulty of forgetting. Inspired by cognitive science, which suggests that\nmemorizing is easier than forgetting, this paper establishes a theoretical link\nbetween memorizing (incremental learning) and forgetting (unlearning). This\nconnection allows machine unlearning to be addressed from the perspective of\nincremental learning. Unlike the time-consuming Hessian computations in\nunlearning (forgetting), incremental learning (memorizing) typically relies on\nmore efficient gradient optimization, which supports the aforementioned\ncognitive theory.

In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a\nBidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance\nfine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.\nExtensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method\nachieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks\nunder both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings."}

However,\nexisting methods for this transfer learning struggle to deal with situations\nwhere the source datasets are also limited and not guaranteed to be\nwell-aligned with the target dataset. A typical strategy is to use the\nempirical loss minimizer on the source data as a prior mean for the target\nparameters, which places the estimation of source parameters outside of the\nBayesian formalism. Our key conceptual contribution is to use a risk minimizer\nconditional on source parameters instead. This allows us to construct a single\njoint prior distribution for all parameters from the source datasets as well as\nthe target dataset. As a consequence, we benefit from full Bayesian uncertainty\nquantification and can perform model averaging via Gibbs sampling over\nindicator variables governing the inclusion of each source dataset. We show how\na particular instantiation of our prior leads to a Bayesian Lasso in a\ntransformed coordinate system and discuss computational techniques to scale our\napproach to moderately sized datasets.

A\nprimary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or\nenvironments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors\nacross diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this\nchallenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can\nachieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore\nRL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction\ncapabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL\nrepresentation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a\nunified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task\nsynthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale\nmulti-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework\nto support this.

To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network.

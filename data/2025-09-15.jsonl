The best-performing model, trained on 3-second segments, was\nfurther evaluated with demographic and clinical features.\n  Findings\n  The best audio-only classifier achieved an AUROC of 85.2% for distinguishing\nTB+ from all others (TB+/Rest) and 80.1% for TB+ versus OR. Adding demographic\nand clinical features improved performance to 92.1% (TB+/Rest) and 84.2%\n(TB+/OR). At a threshold of 0.38, the multimodal model reached 90.3%\nsensitivity and 73.1% specificity for TB+/Rest, and 80.6% and 73.1% for TB+/OR.\n  Interpretation\n  Cough analysis using speech foundation models, especially when combined with\ndemographic and clinical data, showed strong potential as a TB triage tool,\nmeeting WHO target product profile benchmarks. The model was robust to\nconfounding factors including background noise, recording time, and device\nvariability, indicating detection of genuine disease-related acoustic patterns.\nFurther validation across diverse regions and case definitions, including\nsubclinical TB, is required before clinical use."}

Real-world ordering manipulations, however, can\nand do happen even without Byzantine replicas, typically because of factors,\nsuch as faster networks or closer proximity to the blockchain infrastructure,\nthat give some clients an unfair advantage.

Informally, equal opportunity requires that two candidates who,\naccording to a set of criteria deemed to be relevant, are equally qualified for\na position (in our case, a specific slot in the SMR total order), should have\nan equal chance of landing it.

The knowledge base\nspans five key domains: Disease Prevention and Treatment, Nutrition Management,\nRearing Management, Goat Milk Management, and Basic Farming Knowledge.\nAdditionally, an online search module is integrated to enable real-time\nretrieval of up-to-date information. To evaluate system performance, six\nablation experiments were conducted to examine the contribution of each\ncomponent. The results demonstrated that heterogeneous knowledge fusion method\nachieved the best results, with mean accuracies of 87.90% on the validation set\nand 84.22% on the test set. Across the text-based, table-based, decision-tree\nbased Q&A tasks, accuracy consistently exceeded 85%, validating the\neffectiveness of structured knowledge fusion within a modular design. Error\nanalysis identified omission as the predominant error category, highlighting\nopportunities to further improve retrieval coverage and context integration. In\nconclusion, the results highlight the robustness and reliability of the\nproposed system for practical applications in goat farming."}

However, the security of this very mechanism\nis threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private\ntraining data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.\nWhile the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,\ntheir effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper\npresents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient\ninversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one\nemploying pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video\nframes with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use\nof feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion\nattacks.

This shifts the burden from learning a solution function to making\ndomain-aware numerical choices. We ask whether LLMs can act as SciML agents\nthat, given a natural-language ODE description, generate runnable code that is\nscientifically appropriate, selecting suitable solvers (stiff vs. non-stiff),\nand enforcing stability checks. There is currently no benchmark to measure this\nkind of capability for scientific computing tasks. As such, we first introduce\ntwo new datasets: a diagnostic dataset of adversarial \"misleading\" problems;\nand a large-scale benchmark of 1,000 diverse ODE tasks. The diagnostic set\ncontains problems whose superficial appearance suggests stiffness, and that\nrequire algebraic simplification to demonstrate non-stiffness; and the\nlarge-scale benchmark spans stiff and non-stiff ODE regimes. We evaluate open-\nand closed-source LLM models along two axes: (i) unguided versus guided\nprompting with domain-specific knowledge; and (ii) off-the-shelf versus\nfine-tuned variants. Our evaluation measures both executability and numerical\nvalidity against reference solutions.

Although conversational turn organization has\nbeen studied by researchers from diverse fields, the specific strategies,\nespecially gestures used by communicators, had not yet been encoded in a\ndataset that can be used for machine learning. To fill this gap, we enriched\nthe Frame2 dataset with annotations of gestures used for turn organization.

This dataset\nallowed us to closely observe how communicators use interactive gestures\noutside a laboratory, in settings, to our knowledge, not previously recorded in\nrelated literature. Our results have confirmed that communicators involved in\nface-to-face conversation make use of gestures as a tool for passing, taking\nand keeping conversational turns, and also revealed variations of some gestures\nthat had not been documented before.

Our model predicts detailed facial\ngeometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.\nSpecifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and\nintroduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image\nfeature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,\nincorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available\ndatasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training\nprocess. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation\nstudies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC\nFlorence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and\nqualitatively."}

The method operates as a drop-in replacement for standard attention,\nrequiring only hyperparameter specification without architectural\nmodifications. Our approach achieves $\\mathcal{O}(NCD)$ complexity for acausal\nattention with $C$ clusters and $\\mathcal{O}(NCD \\log N)$ for causal attention.\nOn isolated attention layers, we demonstrate $3\\times$ speedup over CUDNN Flash\nAttention at 8k context length, with relative squared errors below 20%. For\ncausal attention, we develop a hierarchical block decomposition that combines\nexact local computation with efficient long-range approximation. In end-to-end\npretraining of a 30M parameter model on book-length texts with 16k context, we\nachieve 12.2% runtime reduction with only 0.36% loss degradation, establishing\nthe viability of multipole approximations for efficient transformer\npretraining."}

On ImageNet classification, we match the accuracy of the\nunmodified transformer with 30\\% fewer floating-point operations per second and\nunder 20\\% of the original communication cost, while for visual question\nanswering our method achieves performance competitive with the full LLaVA model\nat less than one-third of the compute and one-tenth of the bandwidth. Finally,\nwe show that our adaptive merging is robust across varying channel conditions\nand provides inherent privacy benefits, substantially degrading the efficacy of\nmodel inversion attacks. Our framework provides a practical and versatile\nsolution for deploying powerful transformer models in resource-limited edge\nintelligence scenarios."}

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially. The best-performing scenario, which integrated all\ngrowth stages with SMOTE augmentation, achieved 88.37 percent overall accuracy\nand 95.37 percent recall. These results demonstrate the strong potential of\ntemporal multispectral analysis and LSTM networks for early broomrape\ndetection.

Project page: [this https\n  URL](https://bagh2178.github.io/GC-VLN/)", "summary": "In this paper, we propose a training-free framework for vision-and-language\nnavigation (VLN). Existing zero-shot VLN methods are mainly designed for\ndiscrete environments or involve unsupervised training in continuous simulator\nenvironments, which makes it challenging to generalize and deploy them in\nreal-world scenarios. To achieve a training-free framework in continuous\nenvironments, our framework formulates navigation guidance as graph constraint\noptimization by decomposing instructions into explicit spatial constraints. The\nconstraint-driven paradigm decodes spatial semantics through constraint\nsolving, enabling zero-shot adaptation to unseen environments. Specifically, we\nconstruct a spatial constraint library covering all types of spatial\nrelationship mentioned in VLN instructions. The human instruction is decomposed\ninto a directed acyclic graph, with waypoint nodes, object nodes and edges,\nwhich are used as queries to retrieve the library to build the graph\nconstraints. The graph constraint optimization is solved by the constraint\nsolver to determine the positions of waypoints, obtaining the robot's\nnavigation path and final goal. To handle cases of no solution or multiple\nsolutions, we construct a navigation tree and the backtracking mechanism.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant\nimprovements in success rate and navigation efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot VLN methods. We further conduct real-world\nexperiments to show that our framework can effectively generalize to new\nenvironments and instruction sets, paving the way for a more robust and\nautonomous navigation framework."}

To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages.

A lightweight deep neural network\noriginally developed for adult EEG sleep staging was trained on the ovine EEG\nusing transfer learning from adult EEG. A spectral equalisation-based domain\nadaptation strategy was used to reduce cross-domain mismatch.\n  Results: We demonstrated that while direct transfer performed poorly, full\nfine tuning combined with spectral equalisation achieved the best overall\nperformance (accuracy: 86.6 percent, macro F1-score: 62.5), outperforming\nbaseline models.\n  Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, FetalSleepNet is the first deep\nlearning framework specifically developed for automated sleep staging from the\nfetal EEG. Beyond the laboratory, the EEG-based sleep stage classifier\nfunctions as a label engine, enabling large scale weak/semi supervised labeling\nand distillation to facilitate training on less invasive signals that can be\nacquired in the clinic, such as Doppler Ultrasound or electrocardiogram data.\nFetalSleepNet's lightweight design makes it well suited for deployment in low\npower, real time, and wearable fetal monitoring systems."}

The parasite's largely underground life cycle makes early\ndetection difficult, while conventional chemical controls are costly,\nenvironmentally harmful, and often ineffective. To address this, we combined\ndrone-based multispectral imagery with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep\nlearning networks, using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)\nto handle class imbalance. Research was conducted on a known broomrape-infested\ntomato farm in Woodland, Yolo County, CA, across five key growth stages\ndetermined by growing degree days (GDD). Multispectral images were processed to\nisolate tomato canopy reflectance. At 897 GDD, broomrape could be detected with\n79.09 percent overall accuracy and 70.36 percent recall without integrating\nlater stages. Incorporating sequential growth stages with LSTM improved\ndetection substantially.

To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

This has led to\nclaims about these model's ability to solve (learn) unseen tasks with only a\nfew shots (exemplars) in the prompt. However, deduction does not always imply\nlearning, as ICL does not explicitly encode a given observation. Instead, the\nmodels rely on their prior knowledge and the exemplars given, if any. We argue\nthat, mathematically, ICL does constitute learning, but its full\ncharacterisation requires empirical work. We then carry out a large-scale\nanalysis of ICL ablating out or accounting for memorisation, pretraining,\ndistributional shifts, and prompting style and phrasing. We find that ICL is an\neffective learning paradigm, but limited in its ability to learn and generalise\nto unseen tasks. We note that, in the limit where exemplars become more\nnumerous, accuracy is insensitive to exemplar distribution, model, prompt\nstyle, and the input's linguistic features. Instead, it deduces patterns from\nregularities in the prompt, which leads to distributional sensitivity,\nespecially in prompting styles such as chain-of-thought. Given the varied\naccuracies on formally similar tasks, we conclude that autoregression's ad-hoc\nencoding is not a robust mechanism, and suggests limited all-purpose\ngeneralisability."}

The Bridge2AI consortium\nhas defined the particular criteria a biomedical dataset may possess to render\nit AI-ready: in brief, a dataset's readiness is related to its FAIRness,\nprovenance, degree of characterization, explainability, sustainability, and\ncomputability, in addition to its accompaniment with documentation about\nethical data practices.\n  To ensure AI-readiness and to clarify data structure and relationships within\nBridge2AI's Grand Challenges (GCs), particular types of metadata are necessary.\nThe GCs within the Bridge2AI initiative include four data-generating projects\nfocusing on generating AI/ML-ready datasets to tackle complex biomedical and\nbehavioral research problems. These projects develop standardized, multimodal\ndata, tools, and training resources to support AI integration, while addressing\nethical data practices. Examples include using voice as a biomarker, building\ninterpretable genomic tools, modeling disease trajectories with diverse\nmultimodal data, and mapping cellular and molecular health indicators across\nthe human body.\n  This report assesses the state of metadata creation and standardization in\nthe Bridge2AI GCs, provides guidelines where required, and identifies gaps and\nareas for improvement across the program. New projects, including those outside\nthe Bridge2AI consortium, would benefit from what we have learned about\ncreating metadata as part of efforts to promote AI readiness."}

### [1] [GraphTrafficGPT: Enhancing Traffic Management Through Graph-Based AI Agent Coordination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13511)
*Nabil Abdelaziz Ferhat Taleb,Abdolazim Rezaei,Raj Atulkumar Patel,Mehdi Sookhak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphTrafficGPT是一种基于图的架构，用于优化LLM驱动的交通管理任务，解决了现有链式系统（如TrafficGPT）的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前链式系统（如TrafficGPT）存在任务执行顺序化、高令牌消耗和扩展性差的问题，无法满足复杂交通场景的需求。

Method: 提出GraphTrafficGPT，将任务及其依赖关系表示为有向图中的节点和边，通过Brain Agent分解查询并协调多个专业代理，实现并行执行和动态资源分配。

Result: 实验表明，GraphTrafficGPT比TrafficGPT减少50.2%的令牌消耗和19.0%的响应延迟，同时支持多查询并行处理，效率提升23.0%。

Conclusion: GraphTrafficGPT通过图结构和并行处理显著提升了交通管理任务的效率和扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent
traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are
hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability,
making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture,
which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven
traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies
as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution
and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a
Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency
graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval,
analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware
token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed
architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility
environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces
token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to
TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to
23.0% improvement in efficiency.

### [2] [PrefPalette: Personalized Preference Modeling with Latent Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13541)
*Shuyue Stella Li,Melanie Sclar,Hunter Lang,Ansong Ni,Jacqueline He,Puxin Xu,Andrew Cohen,Chan Young Park,Yulia Tsvetkov,Asli Celikyilmaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PrefPalette通过分解用户偏好的属性维度，结合社区价值观，显著提升了偏好预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好模型将人类判断视为黑箱，无法理解偏好背后的原因。PrefPalette旨在通过多属性决策原则，提供更透明和个性化的偏好建模。

Method: 1. 使用可扩展的反事实属性合成生成训练数据，隔离单个属性效果；2. 基于注意力的偏好建模，动态学习不同社区对属性的权重分配。

Result: 在Reddit的45个社区中，PrefPalette的平均预测准确率比GPT-4o高46.6%，并揭示了社区特定的偏好特征。

Conclusion: PrefPalette不仅提升了预测性能，还提供了透明、可解释的洞察，为更可信、价值感知的个性化应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer,
but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models
typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a
framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its
preference prediction to distinct social community values in a
human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science
principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable
counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic
training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality,
humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that
learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes.
This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse
evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social
communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by
46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements,
PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles:
scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented
communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities
emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human
judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and
transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more
trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

### [3] [GOFAI meets Generative AI: Development of Expert Systems by means of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13550)
*Eduardo C. Garrido-Merchán,Cristina Puente*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）和符号系统的新方法，通过限制领域和结构化提示生成可验证的Prolog知识表示，提高专家系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在生成知识时可能出现幻觉或错误的问题，开发可控、透明的专家系统。

Method: 采用结构化提示提取方法，生成Prolog符号表示，并由人类专家验证和修正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在事实准确性和语义连贯性上表现优异，结合了LLMs的召回能力和符号系统的精确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域提供了可靠、可解释的AI应用基础。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

### [4] [Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13558)
*David Poole*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI应关注实体及其关系，而非仅建模像素和文字，并分析了关系学习未普及的原因及改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI主要建模像素和文字，但世界由实体及其关系构成，应直接建模这些实体。

Method: 分析关系学习（如统计关系AI）的现状，探讨其未普及的原因。

Result: 关系学习仅在少数受限关系中成功，需进一步改进以提升其重要性。

Conclusion: 关系学习需更多研究以实现其在AI中的潜力。

Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words,
and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes
but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and
relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or
description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and
pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text
and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most
valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These
are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are
full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other
identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that
studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning,
statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational
learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted
relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

### [5] [DailyLLM: Context-Aware Activity Log Generation Using Multi-Modal Sensors and LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13737)
*Ye Tian,Xiaoyuan Ren,Zihao Wang,Onat Gungor,Xiaofan Yu,Tajana Rosing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DailyLLM是一种基于轻量级LLM的框架，通过整合多维度上下文信息（位置、运动、环境和生理）生成和总结活动日志，显著提升了准确性、效率和语义丰富度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有活动日志生成方法在准确性、效率和语义丰富度方面存在不足，需要一种更高效且全面的解决方案。

Method: DailyLLM采用轻量级LLM框架，结合结构化提示和高效特征提取，整合智能手机和智能手表的传感器数据。

Result: 实验表明，DailyLLM在BERTScore精度上比70B参数的SOTA基线提升17%，推理速度快10倍，且可部署于个人电脑和树莓派。

Conclusion: DailyLLM为活动日志生成提供了一种高效、轻量且全面的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

### [6] [BifrostRAG: Bridging Dual Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering in Construction Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13625)
*Yuxin Zhang,Xi Wang,Mo Hu,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BifrostRAG是一种双图RAG集成系统，通过实体网络图和文档导航图建模语言关系和文档结构，显著提升了多跳问题的检索和回答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决安全法规中复杂语言和结构对信息检索和问答的阻碍，特别是多跳查询需要跨条款信息合成的挑战。

Method: 引入双图架构（实体网络图和文档导航图），结合图遍历和向量语义搜索的混合检索机制。

Result: 在多跳问题数据集上达到92.8%精确率、85.5%召回率和87.3% F1分数，显著优于单模态RAG基线。

Conclusion: BifrostRAG为LLM驱动的合规检查提供了强大知识引擎，其双图混合检索机制可推广至复杂技术文档处理。

Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are
essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by
the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many
compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information
across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce
BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both
linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure
(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval
mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,
enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the
structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that
BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1
score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and
graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error
analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method
over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust
knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid
retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex
technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

### [7] [Buggy rule diagnosis for combined steps through final answer evaluation in stepwise tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13651)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于最终答案的自动错误诊断方法，用于解决学生在智能辅导系统中组合步骤时可能出现的组合爆炸问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生在智能辅导系统中组合多个步骤时，可能的路径组合数量庞大，导致错误诊断困难。利用最终答案进行诊断可以减少组合爆炸的影响。

Method: 研究设计了一种服务，通过自动完成中间输入并根据任务解决方案策略进行诊断，提供错误规则诊断。

Result: 在二次方程求解的数据集上，该方法成功诊断了29.4%的步骤，且与教师诊断结果的一致性达到97%。

Conclusion: 基于最终答案的错误诊断方法具有潜力，为进一步研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise
task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible
paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial
explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a
combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there
are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous)
solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by
automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and
diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error
diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that
provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To
validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of
unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be
diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with
a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of
these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher
diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the
cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the
approach.

### [8] [Cross-modal Causal Intervention for Alzheimer's Disease Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13956)
*Yutao Jin,Haowen Xiao,Jielei Chu,Fengmao Lv,Yuxiao Li,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADPC的视觉-语言因果干预框架，用于辅助诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD），通过消除混杂因素提高分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别轻度认知障碍（MCI）和AD对延缓痴呆症进展至关重要，但现有方法因数据选择偏差和变量间复杂关系存在诊断挑战。

Method: ADPC结合大型语言模型（LLM）总结临床数据，并利用MRI、fMRI图像和文本数据进行分类，通过因果干预消除混杂因素。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD病例上表现优异，达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

### [9] [Combining model tracing and constraint-based modeling for multistep strategy diagnoses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13652)
*Gerben van der Hoek,Johan Jeuring,Rogier Bos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合模型追踪和约束建模的方法，用于诊断学生在多步任务中的输入，并通过实验验证其与教师诊断的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（模型追踪和约束建模）各有局限性，无法全面诊断学生输入，尤其是在学生将多步合并为一步时。

Method: 通过将约束定义为学生输入与策略步骤的共同属性，设计了一个支持多步策略诊断的系统。

Result: 在2136个学生步骤的数据集上验证，系统诊断与教师编码在140个学生步骤中完全一致。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了两种范式，能够准确诊断学生偏离策略的情况。

Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose
student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive
problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling
supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one
step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining
constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a
strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a
strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore
the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these
diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset
containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To
compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations
(n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the
system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student
steps.

*Carlos Bobed,Carlota Quintana,Eduardo Mena,Jorge Bobed,Fernando Bobillo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OntView是一个新型本体可视化工具，旨在通过直观的图形界面展示本体结构和推理知识，解决现有工具在可视化方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本体可视化工具无法有效展示复杂本体结构，尤其是通用概念包含（GCI），限制了用户对大型本体的理解。

Method: OntView基于DL推理器，采用“所见即所意”范式，支持GCI可视化，并提供简化视图功能（如本体摘要、TBox元素聚焦和动态分支隐藏）。

Result: OntView成功实现了直观的本体可视化，并通过开源方式发布，为社区提供了实用工具。

Conclusion: OntView填补了本体可视化工具的空白，提升了用户对复杂本体的理解能力。

Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.
OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统决策引擎通常选择最佳规则，而该研究旨在通过语义交互建模和修辞框架，将冲突的启发式融合为连贯且上下文敏感的叙述。

Method: 结合经典军事理论和现代企业战略，通过量子认知启发的语义相互依赖过程激活和组合多个启发式。

Result: 通过Meta vs. FTC案例研究验证了框架，初步语义指标显示有效性。

Conclusion: 讨论了动态干扰调谐等局限性和扩展方向。

Abstract: We present a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning,
combining heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional
synthesis. Drawing on sources ranging from classical military theory to
contemporary corporate strategy, our model activates and composes multiple
heuristics through a process of semantic interdependence inspired by research
in quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines that select the best
rule, our system fuses conflicting heuristics into coherent and
context-sensitive narratives, guided by semantic interaction modeling and
rhetorical framing. We demonstrate the framework via a Meta vs. FTC case study,
with preliminary validation through semantic metrics. Limitations and
extensions (e.g., dynamic interference tuning) are discussed.

*Haoyang Li,Yuming Xu,Yiming Li,Hanmo Liu,Darian Li,Chen Jason Zhang,Lei Chen,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EAGLE是一个轻量级框架，用于动态图中的时间链接预测，通过结合短期时间新近性和长期全局结构模式，显著提高了效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T-GNN在建模时间和结构依赖时计算开销大，面临可扩展性和效率挑战。

Method: EAGLE包含时间感知模块和结构感知模块，通过自适应权重机制平衡两者，避免复杂计算。

Result: 在七个真实世界动态图上，EAGLE在性能和效率上均优于现有T-GNN，速度提升50倍以上。

Conclusion: EAGLE通过轻量级设计解决了T-GNN的效率问题，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with
applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation
systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural
Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex
architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer
from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead.
In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates
short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE
consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most
recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware
module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence
of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an
adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on
data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop
message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant
improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal
graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance
against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency,
delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果知识转移的多智能体强化学习框架，用于非静态环境中智能体的自适应学习，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统知识转移方法在多智能体非静态环境中难以泛化的问题，减少智能体适应新环境时的重新训练成本。

Method: 引入因果知识转移框架，通过建模碰撞为因果干预，生成恢复动作宏，并在智能体间在线转移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能使智能体在新环境中适应性能提升约50%，且效果受环境复杂性和智能体目标异质性影响。

Conclusion: 因果知识转移为多智能体在非静态环境中的自适应学习提供了有效途径，但需进一步优化以适应更复杂场景。

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable
success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However,
transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary
environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer
methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly
retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge
transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal
representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the
environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive
recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention
instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect
corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while
increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative
reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent
and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by
querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results]
Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were
able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully
retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of
causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment
complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成新颖且相关内容时的局限性，避免依赖领域特定启发式或结构化提示。

Result: 初步结果显示该框架作为通用人机协作创意工具的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为可控创意生成提供了灵活且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language
models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and
relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during
training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt
engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics
and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and
difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic
latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by
navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our
framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,
input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage
prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary

*Pedro Cabalar,Martín Diéguez,François Olivier,Torsten Schaub,Igor Stéphan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的基于时间和约束的逻辑扩展，用于ASP中的非单调时序推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度时间和数值分辨率下动态系统推理的挑战。

Method: 结合线性时间逻辑和约束逻辑，扩展了Here-and-There逻辑及其非单调平衡。

Result: 建立了ASP范式下处理高分辨率复杂动态系统的逻辑框架。

Conclusion: 为ASP中的非单调时序推理提供了首个专门方法。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric
resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like
Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon
a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There
and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our
knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with
constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved
by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the
linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal
reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints,
enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among
others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling
complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KROMA是一个基于大型语言模型（LLMs）和检索增强生成（RAG）的新型本体匹配框架，通过动态丰富语义上下文提升性能，同时优化效率和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本体匹配系统依赖手工规则或专用模型，适应性有限，KROMA旨在通过LLMs和RAG提升语义互操作性。

Method: 结合双相似性概念匹配和轻量级本体优化步骤，减少LLMs调用开销，并通过知识检索和上下文增强提升匹配效果。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，KROMA性能优于传统系统和前沿LLM方法，同时保持低通信开销。

Conclusion: 研究表明，知识检索、提示增强和本体优化技术在大规模本体匹配中具有可行性和显著优势。

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,
yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with
limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of
state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access
to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of
robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible,
and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly
available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 -
2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous
glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected
from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support
researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes
datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with
data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood
glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through
this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction
across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML
collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different
prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings
from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust
AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct
links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and
openly provide our code.

Motivation: 现有的人体运动模拟方法运动逼真度低，无法满足工业任务中对工人行为、安全和生产力评估的需求。

Method: 集成文本到文本和文本到动作模型，利用大型语言模型和MotionGPT词汇表生成运动感知语言，并通过计算机视觉和姿态估计算法验证AI生成动作的准确性。

Result: 在八项任务中，AI增强的动作在大多数场景中表现优于人工描述，显著降低了关节误差和时间错位。

Conclusion: G-AI-HMS显著提升了运动模拟的逼真度和准确性，为工业任务提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动解释无损评估（NDE）轮廓图以提高桥梁维护效率的可行性，发现部分LLM能有效生成详细描述和推荐，显著提升决策速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 桥梁维护和安全至关重要，但NDE数据解读耗时且依赖专家，LLM的进步为自动化分析提供了新途径。

Method: 研究设计了针对NDE轮廓图的LLM提示，评估了多个LLM在生成描述、识别缺陷、提供建议和准确性方面的表现。

Result: 九种LLM中有四种表现优异，尤其是ChatGPT-4和Claude 3.5 Sonnet，能生成更有效的总结，提升效率和准确性。

Conclusion: LLM辅助分析可显著提高桥梁维护效率，为基础设施管理提供创新解决方案。

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities,
and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing
structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and
requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this
analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities
for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in
providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for
integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted
analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study,
several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the
quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different
NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions.
Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed
descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and
demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine
models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of
topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models
are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of
the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more
effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to
significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an
innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and
summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and
enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CUDA-L1是一种基于强化学习的自动化CUDA优化框架，显著提升GPU计算效率，平均加速比达17.7倍，并展示出色的跨架构移植能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型对GPU计算资源的需求激增，现有模型在CUDA优化上成功率低，亟需自动化优化策略。

Method: 引入CUDA-L1，一个基于强化学习的框架，通过速度提升奖励信号训练模型，无需人工干预。

Result: 在NVIDIA A100上平均加速17.7倍，峰值达449倍，并在多种GPU架构上表现优异。

Conclusion: CUDA-L1证明强化学习可有效优化CUDA操作，提升GPU效率，缓解资源压力。

Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the
rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for
automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show
promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low
success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an
automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task:
trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250
CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the
model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures,
achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40,
x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100.
Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable
properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns
to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers
fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious
performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that
harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can
transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer
through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain
knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning
abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated
optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU
efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Motivation: 钓鱼攻击是严重的网络安全威胁，需要适应性强的检测技术。

Method: ALP是一种结构化语义推理方法，通过分析文本欺骗、紧急信号和操纵性措辞，结合文本、视觉和URL分析，构建统一模型。

Result: 实验显示ALP显著提升检测准确率，F1分数达0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP为基于语言的钓鱼检测系统提供了更强大、可解释和自适应的基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

TL;DR: PersonaGen是一个基于多阶段角色条件的大语言模型框架，用于生成情感丰富的文本，解决了情感识别领域高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感表达具有主观性和多样性，且受个人特质、社会文化背景和情境影响，导致大规模、通用性数据收集困难。

Method: 通过结合人口属性、社会文化背景和情境构建虚拟角色，指导情感表达生成，并评估生成数据的多样性、人机相似性、真实性和实用性。

Result: PersonaGen在生成多样、连贯且可区分的情感表达方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaGen可作为增强或替代真实情感数据集的可靠工具。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息提升预训练大语言模型（LLM）在结构化输入（如AMR图）上的表现，显著提高了AMR到文本生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理抽象意义表示（AMR）等结构化输入时，常忽略关键结构信息或依赖与标准LLM不兼容的架构，限制了性能。

Method: SAFT通过计算方向敏感的位置编码（基于磁拉普拉斯变换的AMR）并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间，无需改变模型架构。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，性能增益随图复杂度增加而显著。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了一种通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

Motivation: 假新闻在数字世界中快速传播，需要有效的方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 利用NLP技术将新闻文章转换为图结构，并应用基于MDL的GBAD算法进行图挖掘，识别异常模式。

Result: 方法能够发现数据集中的规范模式并检测偏离这些模式的异常新闻。

Conclusion: 图基方法在处理上下文数据时表现出色，为假新闻检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型（LLMs）以英语为中心，忽视了印度等多语言地区的需求，导致结构性的语言代表性不足。

Method: PARAM-1采用双语（印地语和英语）数据集，通过25%的印度语料分配、适应印度形态的标记化和文化对齐的评估基准进行训练。

Result: PARAM-1在通用任务和印度中心应用中表现优异，为公平的基础模型设计提供了范例。

Conclusion: PARAM-1展示了在预训练阶段嵌入多样性的有效性，为多语言模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

Method: 利用大型语言模型可靠提取意见单元，并优化主题建模流程，结合情感评分生成连贯且可解释的主题。

Result: 主题建模性能提升，生成的主题更连贯且可解释，同时能捕捉每个主题的情感。通过关联主题、情感与业务指标（如星级评分），揭示了客户关注点对业务的影响。

Conclusion: 该系统在生成连贯主题和整合主题与情感模态以预测星级评分方面表现出色，优于其他主题建模和分类解决方案。

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

Motivation: 现有方法需平行语料库来保持风格，限制了应用范围。

Method: Babel结合风格检测器和扩散式风格应用器，作为后处理模块集成到现有NMT系统。

Result: 在五个领域实验中，Babel风格不一致检测精度达88.21%，风格保留提升150%，语义相似度0.92。

Conclusion: Babel能有效提升翻译风格保真度，同时保持语义完整性和流畅性。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

Motivation: 解决在零样本设置下无法通过显式语言提示或微调控制LLMs生成目标语言的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的SAE特征，识别并修改与目标语言相关的特征，实现语言转换。

Result: 通过修改单个SAE特征，成功实现高达90%的语言转换，同时保持语义保真度。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征调控是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，能显著改善语言模型的事实性。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Paper Summary Attack (PSA)的新颖攻击方法，利用LLMs对权威来源的信任，通过合成攻击或防御导向的论文内容构造对抗性提示模板，成功攻击了包括Deepseek-R1在内的先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），这可能带来新的安全漏洞，因此提出PSA方法验证这一可能性。

Method: 设计PSA方法，通过合成攻击或防御导向的论文内容构造对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子部分中填充有害查询作为对抗性载荷。

Result: PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet上达到97%的攻击成功率，在Deepseek-R1上达到98%，并揭示了不同模型间对攻击或防御导向论文的相反漏洞倾向。

Conclusion: PSA不仅验证了LLMs的漏洞，还为对抗性方法和安全对齐的未来研究提供了线索。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种广泛使用的价值探测方法在大型语言模型（LLM）中的鲁棒性和表达能力，发现输入扰动下所有方法均存在较大方差。同时，研究表明人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响有限，且模型的价值与其在价值相关场景中的行为相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在评估LLM的价值取向时存在挑战，包括缺乏对探测方法的系统比较，以及不确定探测到的价值是否能反映模型的真实行为和偏好。

Method: 通过变化提示和选项，评估三种价值探测策略的鲁棒性，并引入两项任务研究价值对人口统计背景的响应及其与模型行为的对齐程度。

Result: 所有探测方法在输入扰动下表现不稳定；人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响较小；模型的价值与其行为相关性较弱。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对LLM价值探测方法进行更细致检查的必要性，并提醒注意其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

Motivation: 探索句法结构的数学表示及其神经计算实现的可行性，为语言处理的神经机制提供理论基础。

Result: 证明了句法结构的神经计算实现是理论可行的，并通过具体案例展示了Merge运算的实现方式。

Conclusion: 研究为句法结构的神经计算提供了理论支持，并揭示了Merge运算与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

Motivation: 传统临床评分量表资源密集且难以扩展，而自动语音分析提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，但其在评估FTD严重程度中的实用性尚需验证。

Method: 研究整合了停顿特征和语义连贯性指标，使用支持向量回归（SVR）预测临床FTD评分，并在三个数据集（AVH、TOPSY、PsyCL）中进行了验证。

Result: 停顿特征单独使用时能稳健预测FTD严重程度，与语义指标结合后进一步提升了预测性能（最高相关性0.649，AUC达83.71%）。

Conclusion: 结合时间和语义分析框架为改进精神障碍中言语紊乱的评估提供了方向，并推动了自动化语音分析在精神病学中的应用。

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）生成的文本越来越接近人类写作，但现有研究多集中于分类而非特征分析。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 选择8个领域、11种LLM生成的数据集，计算语言学特征（如依存长度、情感性），并结合采样策略、重复控制和模型发布时间进行统计分析。

Result: 人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样；人类和机器文本在不同领域均呈现风格多样性，但人类变化更大；新模型生成的文本风格趋同。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本的风格逐渐同质化，人类文本在语言特征上更具多样性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and

Conclusion: CU-ICU是一种高效、低开销的解决方案，适用于真实ICU环境中的临床决策支持。

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有级联方法依赖精确文本匹配，难以评估自由形式输出的可靠性。

Method: 提出Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC)，识别弱模型输出的代表性答案并评估语义对齐。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，KiC达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，成本降低28.81%，甚至在某些任务中超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

Conclusion: LoopServe通过自适应优化，有效解决了多轮对话中的LLM性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs在群组推荐系统中存在透明度和解释一致性问题，需改进以提升可解释性和效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在输出中常再现训练数据中的性别和性取向偏见，需减少此类偏见以提升包容性。

Method: 使用WinoQueer基准评估三种开源LLMs的偏见水平，并比较LoRA和soft-prompt tuning两种微调技术。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）显著降低偏见分数（最高50分），中立性从0%提升至36%；soft-prompt tuning效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以低计算成本显著提升公平性，建议推广社区参与的PEFT技术、扩大LGBTQIA+语料库，并持续审计模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的GSDMM+算法，用于短文本聚类，解决了稀疏性和高维度问题，并通过实验验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短文本聚类在社交媒体时代日益重要，但现有方法面临稀疏性、高维度和计算复杂度等挑战。

Method: 基于GSDMM算法改进，提出GSDMM+，通过减少初始化噪声、自适应调整词权重和策略性簇合并优化性能。

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和最新方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+是一种高效的短文本聚类方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

Motivation: 学者需要快速理解文章核心内容，但现有方法难以高效提取关键概念。

Method: 1. 基于大语言模型的方法：选择重要段落生成问题并排名，再生成答案。2. 基于知识图谱的方法：构建知识图谱，提取关键三元组生成问答对。

Result: 知识图谱方法能更有效地捕捉文章核心思想，且实体关系提取模型的微调对高质量三元组提取至关重要。

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法在提取科学文章关键概念方面表现更优，为学术研究提供了高效工具。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Motivation: 探索语言表达与心理状态的关系，特别是在中国文化背景下，填补英语语境研究的不足。

Method: 基于735个在线心理咨询会话的语料库，使用LIWC软件量化语言模式，采用广义线性混合效应模型分析。

Result: 负面情绪词频率与抑郁和焦虑状态严重程度显著正相关；第一人称单数代词使用频率与心理状态无显著关联。

Conclusion: 文化背景和会话动态对心理健康交流中的语言使用有重要影响，为中文人群的心理治疗提供了新的语言标记参考。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种概率框架来定义侦探小说中的公平性（fair play），并设计了相关指标。研究发现，LLM生成的侦探故事在惊喜与公平性之间难以平衡，导致质量较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侦探小说中的公平性（fair play）是作者与读者之间关于故事结局范围的隐性协议，研究旨在量化这一概念并评估其效果。

Method: 通过概率框架定义公平性，并设计相关指标，同时分析故事的一致性与惊喜度之间的张力。

Result: LLM生成的侦探故事虽然不可预测，但在惊喜与公平性的平衡上表现不佳，影响故事质量。

Conclusion: 研究为评估侦探小说质量提供了量化工具，并揭示了LLM在生成此类故事时的局限性。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Result: InTraVisTo提供了对Transformer模型内部计算过程的深入洞察。

Conclusion: 该工具有助于研究人员更好地理解LLM的内部计算模式和推理过程。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

Motivation: 网络安全NER领域缺乏标准化标签，导致数据集难以整合，研究旨在提高数据资源的可用性。

Method: 采用粗粒度标签统一方法，使用BiLSTM模型进行跨数据集评估，并提出多头和基于图的转移模型。

Result: 统一数据集训练的模型泛化能力差，多头模型仅略有改进，基于图的转移模型性能无显著提升。

Conclusion: 标签统一存在局限性，未来需探索更有效的模型架构或方法。

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码转换在现实场景中常见，但缺乏专用数据集限制了ASR性能，尤其是在加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语环境中。

Method: 采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用带语言标记的真实CS数据，并微调Whisper模型。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据和主要语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 合成数据与语言标记的结合是提升CS-ASR性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

Result: 该方法为个人和专业技能的自动化评分奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 研究展示了LLMs在SJT评分中的潜力，为未来自动化评分系统的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Method: 通过三个大规模实验（N=76,977），测试19个LLM在707个政治议题上的说服力，并检查466,769个LLM生成声明的事实准确性。

Result: 后训练和提示方法显著提升AI说服力（分别达51%和27%），但会降低事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力提升主要依赖后训练和提示方法，但这些方法可能牺牲事实准确性，需谨慎使用。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升MCQA性能，揭示了偏差的双重性。

Conclusion: 研究为偏差感知模型设计和NLP应用提供了新视角，偏差既是挑战也是机会。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

Motivation: 传统语言模型的通用训练方法难以获得深度领域专业知识，需要一种自下而上的学习方法。

Result: QwQ-Med-3模型在医学领域显著优于现有推理模型，并能将专业知识迁移到基础模型中。

Conclusion: 未来通用人工智能（AGI）可能由高效领域特定超智能代理的可组合交互实现。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统的发展面临挑战，尤其是对语言变体的关注不足。

Method: 采用通用方法处理阿拉伯语语音和文本，基于FastConformer架构训练MSA和CA模型。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能，统一模型在CA上实现带音标的SOTA准确性，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 开源模型和训练方法以促进可重复性。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and
image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

*Lautaro Estienne,Gabriel Ben Zenou,Nona Naderi,Jackie Cheung,Pablo Piantanida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种协作理性言语行为（CRSA）框架，通过信息论扩展RSA模型，优化多轮对话中的增益函数，提升AI系统的协作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RSA框架在多轮协作场景中扩展性不足，需改进以支持共享目标和信念的推理。

Method: 引入CRSA，基于信息论扩展RSA，优化多轮对话中的增益函数，考虑对话双方的私有信息。

Result: 在指称游戏和医患对话实验中，CRSA表现出更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识强的语言代理提供了新方向。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

*Garapati Keerthana,Manik Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考过往病历的方式，生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展记录，填补了电子健康记录中进展记录的缺失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进展记录在电子健康记录中具有重要临床意义，但在大规模数据集中严重缺失，影响患者纵向叙事的完整性。

Method: DENSE系统采用细粒度分类和时间对齐机制，结合临床检索策略和大语言模型生成进展记录。

Result: 生成的记录在时间对齐和临床连贯性上表现优异，时间对齐比为1.089，优于原始记录。

Conclusion: DENSE系统为临床记录生成提供了可扩展的解决方案，支持下游任务如总结、预测建模和临床决策支持。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLABA track评估了语言模型在将生物医学文献改写为通俗语言方面的表现，发现模型在事实准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性和简单性上仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献通常专业性强，难以被患者和护理人员理解。语言模型有望解决这一问题，但需要严格评估以避免潜在风险。

Method: 通过PLABA任务（改写摘要和替换专业术语）评估模型表现，结合自动和人工评估。

Result: 模型在事实准确性和完整性上表现良好，但在简洁性和简单性上不及人类。自动评估指标与人工评估相关性较低。

Conclusion: 语言模型在生物医学文献通俗化方面有潜力，但仍需改进简洁性和自动评估工具。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机目标检测方法局限于预定义类别，而OVOD通过跨模态文本-图像对齐技术（如CLIP）实现了对未见对象的检测，提升了无人机场景理解的智能性和自主性。

Method: 通过系统分类法对现有OVOD方法进行归纳，并全面梳理相关数据集，分析关键挑战和开放性问题。

Result: 提出了无人机航拍场景中OVOD的清晰路线图，为研究者提供了有价值的参考。

Conclusion: 本文为无人机航拍场景中的OVOD研究提供了系统综述，并指出了未来研究方向和应用前景。

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey
aims to provide a clear road map and a valuable reference for both newcomers
and seasoned researchers, fostering innovation in this rapidly evolving domain.

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net架构的新型深度学习框架，通过亮度图引导和SPP模块增强低光图像，性能优越且模型复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像增强问题，提高模型对多样化光照条件的适应能力。

Method: 结合U-Net架构、亮度图引导、SPP模块和Swish激活函数，采用GAN框架和复合损失函数优化。

Result: 在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适合实际应用，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

TL;DR: HeCoFuse是一个统一的框架，用于解决V2X协同感知中异构传感器配置的挑战，通过分层融合机制和自适应学习策略，显著提升了感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统因成本和部署差异导致传感器配置异构，这给特征融合和感知可靠性带来挑战。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，结合动态融合类型的学习策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前V2X协同感知的先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，发现即使顶尖模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro、Claude Vision 3.7、GPT-o4-mini）在简单任务中也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型在非局部视觉推理任务中的能力，揭示其在复杂视觉任务中的局限性。

Method: 设计了三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索、平滑视觉搜索），测试模型表现。

Result: 顶尖模型在这些任务中表现接近随机水平，远低于人类能力。

Conclusion: 当前模型在核心视觉推理能力上仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而GRPO强化学习方法优于监督微调（SFT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLMs的空间推理能力，并解决SFT在泛化性上的不足。

Method: 使用SceneGraph CoT提示策略和GRPO强化学习方法，在SAT数据集上微调模型，并在CVBench上评估性能。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下表现优于SFT，泛化性更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性，GRPO方法优于传统SFT。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间渲染新视图，即使输入视图较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且优化效率低，同时元宇宙等需求要求能够自然模拟昼夜变化的3D环境。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持任意时间的神经辐射场建模。

Result: TimeNeRF在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化即可渲染新视图，并能平滑过渡不同时间，捕捉自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF在少样本和时序场景建模中表现出色，为动态3D场景渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

Result: 在多种设置下（如LiDAR和RGB-D输入）实现竞争性定位性能，且无需训练。

Conclusion: 展示了2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中的潜力。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

Result: 在BDD100K、KITTI和Cityscapes数据集上的实验表明，Butter在检测精度和模型复杂度方面表现优越。

Conclusion: Butter通过分层特征优化，实现了精度、可部署性和计算效率的平衡，适用于实时自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,
facilitating further research and validation within the autonomous driving

### [76] [Smart Routing for Multimodal Video Retrieval: When to Search What](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13374)
*Kevin Dela Rosa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ModaRoute是一个基于LLM的多模态视频检索路由系统，通过动态选择最优模态，减少计算开销41%，同时保持60.9%的召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统密集文本标注需要昂贵的离线处理且会丢失34%的视觉信息（如场景文本），因此需要一种更高效的多模态检索方法。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图并预测信息需求，动态路由查询到ASR、OCR和视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态。

Result: 在180万视频片段上的评估显示，ModaRoute减少计算开销41%，召回率达60.9%，优于传统3模态搜索。

Conclusion: 智能路由为多模态检索系统提供了实用解决方案，降低了基础设施成本并保持竞争力。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

*Yuqi Cheng,Yunkang Cao,Haiming Yao,Wei Luo,Cheng Jiang,Hui Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 工业缺陷检测对产品质量至关重要，传统方法难以满足现代需求。计算机视觉和深度学习的进展推动了2D和3D检测能力，尤其是从封闭集到开放集检测的转变。本文综述了相关方法、挑战和趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业缺陷检测方法无法满足现代制造对精度、自动化和可扩展性的需求，而计算机视觉和深度学习的进步为改进检测能力提供了可能。

Method: 综述了封闭集和开放集缺陷检测方法在2D和3D模态中的应用，并分析了其近年来的发展。

Result: 开放集检测技术日益重要，减少了缺陷标注需求并支持新异常识别。

Conclusion: 本文提供了工业缺陷检测领域的全面视角，总结了关键挑战和新兴趋势。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

*Arjun Rao,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在卫星图像机器学习（SatML）中结合其他地理数据层对模型性能的影响，发现多模态输入能显著提升性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域测试时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SatML模型主要依赖光学图像输入，而其他地理数据层的潜在价值未被充分探索。

Method: 通过将额外地理数据层附加到SatML基准任务中，生成增强数据集，并比较不同融合策略的效果。

Result: 多模态输入显著提升模型性能，尤其在数据有限和跨区域测试时；硬编码融合策略优于学习型策略。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对SatML模型的数据效率和泛化能力具有重要价值，硬编码融合策略值得进一步研究。

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成输出分布距离的最小化概念擦除方法，通过端到端优化和神经元掩码技术，在不影响模型性能的情况下有效擦除概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型依赖大规模无标签数据引发安全和版权问题，现有擦除方法过度修改模型影响实用性。

Result: 在先进流匹配模型上验证，方法能鲁棒擦除概念且不降低模型性能。

Conclusion: 为更安全、负责任的生成模型提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

*Chihiro Noguchi,Takaki Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用低成本二进制占用数据增强3D语义占用预测的框架，通过分解预测过程为二进制和语义模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D语义占用预测需要昂贵的标注LiDAR数据，而低成本的大规模二进制占用数据潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出了一种基于二进制占用的框架，将预测过程分解为二进制和语义占用模块，充分利用二进制数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在预训练和自动标注任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升了3D语义占用预测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的模型InSyn，用于行人轨迹预测，通过显式捕捉多样交互模式和方向敏感行为，结合SSOS训练策略，显著提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人轨迹预测在智能应用中至关重要，但现有方法因忽略特定交互模式（如配对行走或冲突行为）而受限。

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上表现优于基线，尤其在高密度场景中，SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，尤其在复杂交互场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但在结构化编辑和组合控制方面仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出MAgD训练策略，结合去噪得分匹配和掩码重建；引入推理时容量扩展机制（Pause Tokens）。

Result: MADI显著提升了扩散模型的可编辑性和组合性，支持局部化和结构感知的编辑。

Conclusion: MADI为扩散模型在通用上下文生成架构中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集通常只关注离散的警觉/ drowsy 标签，缺乏连续状态的记录。本研究旨在填补这一空白，提供更全面的多模态数据。

Method: 数据集通过3D面部视频、红外摄像头、后视视频和多种生物信号（如心率、皮肤电活动等）收集，并结合方向盘握力传感器和模拟器数据。 drowsiness 水平通过KSS量表每4分钟自评一次。

Result: 数据集包含19名受试者的连续40分钟记录，总时长1400分钟，记录了从警觉到 drowsy 的渐变状态。

Conclusion: 该数据集为驾驶员 drowsiness 检测研究提供了更全面的多模态数据支持，未来可进一步用于算法开发和验证。

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据和手动干预，难以生成几何一致且适合CFD分析的表面。

Method: AortaDiff使用体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效构建正常和病理主动脉网格，几何保真度高。

Conclusion: AortaDiff是一种端到端解决方案，适用于心血管研究，能生成高质量可视化结果。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准很少测试模型在视觉蕴含任务（如基于图像接受或反驳假设）中的能力。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成生成的真/假陈述对，图像来自CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型准确率低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 结果表明视觉语言模型在拥挤场景中的视觉蕴含推理能力存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像对防止虚假信息和确保数字真实性至关重要。传统水印技术易受对抗攻击，效果有限。

Method: IConMark在生成过程中嵌入可解释的语义属性，而非传统噪声或扰动，使其对人类可读且抗对抗攻击。还结合了StegaStamp和TrustMark形成混合方法（IConMark+SS和IConMark+TM）。

Conclusion: IConMark为可解释水印技术提供了有效解决方案，结合现有方法可进一步增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

Method: 开发基于10,000张标注X光片的多模型深度学习系统，采用Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet等架构，并应用边界框和分类级集成技术。

Result: NMW集成方法达到95.5%准确率和0.9610 F1分数，优于单一模型，表现出高召回率和定位精度。

Conclusion: 集成AI系统能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合实时诊断流程，但当前模型仅支持二元骨折检测，用于快速筛查而非详细分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用AI技术和历史卫星图像（CORONA）识别因人类活动而消失的考古遗址。

Method: 在现有Bing卷积网络模型基础上，使用CORONA卫星图像对伊拉克阿布格莱布地区进行重新训练。

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU超过85%，总体准确率90%），并发现四个新考古遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合CORONA图像是识别已消失考古遗址的有效方法，对考古学研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵传感器或深度数据，且需已知相机参数，限制了应用场景。

Method: 通过自监督深度网络获取点云，双路径分别提取空间和语义信息，利用3D车道锚点采样特征推断几何。

Result: 在OpenLane基准测试中表现优异，且能预测相机参数，适用于无标定场景。

Conclusion: Depth3DLane解决了现有方法的局限性，扩展了应用范围，性能优越。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in
scenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光点云的精度高度依赖场景，而MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过关联误差协方差矩阵，提出一种自校准方法，利用MVS阶段的可靠点和相关线索回归视差不确定性。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上验证，该方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且不过高估计不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法为光点云提供了鲁棒且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D材料在纳米电子学中的应用增加，需要高效的电气表征技术，传统AFM方法速度慢。

Method: 开发SparseC-AFM模型，通过稀疏C-AFM扫描快速重建导电性图。

Result: 相比传统方法，采集时间减少11倍，且预测结果与高分辨率数据相似。

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM为2D材料表征从实验室研究到工业应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效扩展了TGV模型，适用于流形值函数，并在去噪任务中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized

in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued
function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous
discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a

setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Conclusion: NABLA无需定制低层算子设计，可无缝集成到PyTorch的Flex Attention中，为视频生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that
dynamically adapts to sparsity patterns in video diffusion transformers (DiTs).
By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our
method does not require custom low-level operator design and can be seamlessly
integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,
human evaluation score) and visual quality drop. The code and model weights are

Motivation: 现有合成重放方法生成的样本可能因未捕捉领域细微差异和细粒度语义而误导微调，导致先验知识丢失。

Method: 采用LoRA增强的生成器，通过两阶段置信度样本选择（先选真实任务数据，再选合成样本）优化生成和蒸馏。

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优于现有方法，平衡了可塑性、稳定性和零样本能力。

Conclusion: 通过LoRA适配生成器，显著提升了视觉语言模型在持续学习中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Conclusion: NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF是一种有效的从噪声点云重建高质量表面的方法。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds
remains a challenging task, particularly when data is captured using
low-quality scanning devices. These point clouds often contain substantial
noise, leading to inaccurate surface reconstructions. Inspired by the
Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

Motivation: 由于获取大量真实的模糊-清晰图像对困难且昂贵，研究从无配对数据中学习去模糊更实用。现有方法依赖对抗学习，忽略了真实模糊的复杂性。

Method: 提出扩散模型框架，结合纹理先验编码器（TPE）和纹理转移变换层（TTformer），利用自适应过滤去除空间变化模糊。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为无监督去模糊提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间降至基线的1.6%，同时保持图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效生成高质量SR图像方面具有潜力。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

Method: CoTasks将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、空间和时间关系提取四个任务，并将这些中间推理步骤嵌入输入中。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B的性能分别提升了3.3和17.4分，部分子类别提升显著。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为一种结构化CoT监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for

Motivation: 在机器人技术中，从移动相机视角分离动态和静态物体对3D重建、自主导航和场景理解至关重要。现有方法主要依赖光流，但在复杂结构化场景中效果不佳。

Method: FoELS通过计算光流的扩展焦点（FoE）并利用其异常值生成初始运动似然，再结合分割先验估计最终运动概率。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频上的评估表明，该方法在复杂场景、旋转相机运动和平行运动等挑战中表现优异。

Conclusion: FoELS方法有效解决了复杂场景中动态物体检测的难题，性能达到当前最优水平。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型因变形计算成本高导致推理速度慢，EPSilon旨在通过优化采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: EPSilon采用空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）策略，减少无效采样点，提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合3D头像生成的效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

TL;DR: 提出MaskHOI框架，通过掩码自编码器和区域特定掩码分配，提升3D手-物交互任务中的姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB图像几何模糊和交互中严重遮挡导致的3D手-物姿态估计困难。

Method: 采用掩码自编码器预训练框架，引入区域特定掩码分配和骨架驱动掩码指导，结合掩码符号距离场多模态学习。

Result: 实验表明，方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性学习，有效提升3D手-物交互姿态估计性能。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构健康监测对高精度运动测量的需求增加，现有视觉方法在亚像素级测量中精度不足或需大量手动调参。

Method: 开发了一种基于高斯核的运动测量方法，通过跟踪高斯核位置提取帧间运动，引入运动一致性和超分辨率约束以提高精度和鲁棒性。

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需针对不同样本定制参数即可实现高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、无需手动调参的解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种用于多目标跟踪（MOT）算法性能评估的准度量，分别扩展了GOSPA和T-GOSPA度量，具有更灵活的惩罚机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GOSPA和T-GOSPA度量在多目标跟踪评估中缺乏灵活性，无法根据应用需求调整对误检和漏检的惩罚。

Method: 提出两种准度量：一种基于GOSPA度量，用于测量对象集之间的差异；另一种基于T-GOSPA度量，用于测量轨迹集之间的差异，并引入非对称定位成本和不同惩罚机制。

Result: 通过仿真实验，使用T-GOSPA准度量评估了几种贝叶斯MOT算法的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的准度量在多目标跟踪评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在复杂、抽象或高度描述性语言（如诗歌）上表现不佳，信息丢失严重。

Method: 结合多阶段提示优化循环和自注意力机制，生成多张一致图像以传达诗歌含义。

Result: 人类和定量评估验证了方法的有效性，生成图像能更好地捕捉诗歌信息。

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，提升了信息保留能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Depth-Anything for detailed local reconstruction, the proposed approach
produces optimized depth maps that effectively represent complex artistic
features. These maps are then converted into high-quality point clouds and
meshes, enabling the creation of immersive AR experiences. The methodology
leverages state-of-the-art neural network architectures and advanced computer
vision techniques to overcome challenges posed by irregular contours and
variable textures in artworks. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy and visual realism, making the system a
highly robust tool for museums seeking to enhance visitor engagement through

Motivation: 随着AI生成图像的普及，理解StyleGAN等模型的内部运作机制及其潜在风险变得尤为重要。

Method: 使用PyTorch框架训练StyleGAN模型，通过权重修剪和潜在向量分析来研究其行为。

Result: 研究发现大量权重可修剪而不显著影响输出，且潜在向量能精确控制生成图像的面部特征。

Conclusion: StyleGAN的技术能力虽具学术价值，但也可能被恶意利用，引发严重的伦理问题。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过冻结主干和最小化可训练组件，实现了高效且高性能的小样本类增量学习。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Result: 实验证明EVS在图像和运动质量上优于现有方法，推理速度提升1.6x-4.5x。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，显著提升了生成视频的质量和效率。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MST和BISRNet两种HSI重建方法上性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM的结合显著提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore通过动态策略有效解决了保真度与质量的平衡问题，显著提升了盲脸恢复的效果。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过时空建模显著提升了3D场景补全的准确性和遮挡推理能力。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAM-MAMBA框架通过线性复杂度的Mamba模型和优化的GRAM矩阵策略，解决了多模态融合中的效率、对齐和缺失数据问题，实验验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IoT多模态感知系统存在模型复杂度高、模态对齐单向性及数据缺失鲁棒性差的问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合Mamba模型处理时间序列数据，使用GRAM矩阵优化模态对齐，并引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上表现优异，错误率低且性能提升显著，训练参数极少。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA为资源受限环境下的高效鲁棒多模态感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: SkySense V2是一个统一的多模态遥感基础模型，通过单一Transformer主干处理多模态数据，采用自适应SSL策略和MoE模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需为每种模态训练独立网络，导致冗余和低效，且SSL方法未充分考虑遥感图像特性。

Method: 使用单一Transformer主干，结合自适应patch合并模块、可学习模态提示token和MoE模块。

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型需要大量高质量的三元组数据，但手动标注成本高且难以保证像素级准确性。缺乏自动化评估指标也限制了数据规模。

Method: 采用基于公共生成模型的自动化管道，结合Gemini验证器直接评分指令遵循和美学质量，无需分割或基础模型。通过反转和组合引导扩展数据集。

Result: 生成了NHR-Edit数据集（358k高质量三元组），在跨数据集评估中表现最优。开源模型Bagel-NHR-Edit达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 自动化方法显著提升了数据规模和训练效率，为图像编辑研究提供了开源资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that
enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as
benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models
(Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal
modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To
address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for
future Video-LMM development.

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban
planning, disaster response, and population mapping. Yet accurately segmenting
buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景中的可控、高保真图像定制提供了新思路，并将公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs因知识冲突导致的幻觉和不可靠响应问题，探索其内部机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位关键注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 定位到控制冲突的小部分注意力头，修改后可引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入，且这些头的注意力定位能力优于梯度归因。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，为模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-GS技术在复杂相机轨迹场景中表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和联合优化问题。

Result: 实验表明PCR-GS在复杂相机轨迹下实现更优的无姿态3D场景建模。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过共正则化显著提升了复杂场景的3D建模和相机姿态估计能力。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Motivation: LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限，尤其是反射率属性的区分能力较弱，而DepthAnything提供的密集深度先验信息可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 通过融合DepthAnything预测的深度先验与原始LiDAR属性，提出点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架（体素分支和点分支），并设计双向门控RoI特征融合模块。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 将视觉基础模型的先验信息融入LiDAR 3D目标检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在视频中分离静态和动态内容时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建的挑战，DiViD旨在通过显式分离和引入关键归纳偏置来解决这些问题。

Method: DiViD通过序列编码器提取全局静态标记和每帧动态标记，并利用条件DDPM解码器结合共享噪声计划、时间变化的KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制。

Result: DiViD在真实世界基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了最高的交换联合准确性，保持了静态保真度并减少了交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD通过显式分离静态和动态内容，显著提升了视频中静态和动态因素的解耦效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对视频理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解任务提供了高效解决方案，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Motivation: 隧道裂缝是隧道安全状态的重要指标，需要高精度和高效的自动检测方法。

Method: 采用两步法：第一步使用DenseNet-169分类隧道图像，第二步基于DeepLabV3+分割裂缝，并通过可视化技术解释模型逻辑。

Result: 分类模型准确率92.23%，FPS 39.80；分割模型IoU 57.01%，F1分数67.44%，均优于其他模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为隧道健康状态的快速准确评估提供了基础，并有助于理解深度学习模型的“黑箱”问题。

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Motivation: 精准农业需要早期检测植物叶片营养缺乏，以优化施肥和疾病管理。

Method: 使用多光谱成像和带Transformer注意力头的增强YOLOv5模型，处理九通道输入并捕捉细微症状。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在Dice分数和IoU上比基线YOLOv5提升约12%，尤其在检测萎黄和色素积累方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 结合多光谱成像与光谱-空间特征学习，为植物表型和精准农业提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of nutrient deficiency in plant leaves is essential for
precision agriculture, enabling early intervention in fertilization, disease,
and stress management. This study presents a deep learning framework for leaf
anomaly segmentation using multispectral imaging and an enhanced YOLOv5 model
with a transformer-based attention head. The model is tailored for processing
nine-channel multispectral input and uses self-attention mechanisms to better
capture subtle, spatially-distributed symptoms. The plants in the experiments
were grown under controlled nutrient stress conditions for evaluation. We carry
out extensive experiments to benchmark the proposed model against the baseline
YOLOv5. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the baseline YOLOv5, with an average Dice score and IoU
(Intersection over Union) improvement of about 12%. In particular, this model
is effective in detecting challenging symptoms like chlorosis and pigment
accumulation. These results highlight the promise of combining multi-spectral
imaging with spectral-spatial feature learning for advancing plant phenotyping
and precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合情绪和视觉内容的图像编辑方法，包括数据集MoodArchive、模型MoodifyCLIP和编辑工具Moodifier，实现了高精度的情绪驱动编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情绪驱动的图像编辑在创意产业中潜力巨大，但由于情绪的抽象性和多样性，精确操作仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 构建MoodArchive数据集；2. 开发MoodifyCLIP模型；3. 提出无需训练的编辑模型Moodifier。

Result: Moodifier在情绪准确性和内容保留上优于现有方法，适用于多领域编辑。

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情绪与具体视觉变化关联，为实际应用中的情绪内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于量子辅助网络的超轻量级EIT图像重建框架QuantEIT，显著降低了模型复杂度，并在无监督、无需训练数据的情况下实现了高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EIT图像重建的逆问题具有病态性，传统深度学习方法依赖复杂网络结构，效率低且难以扩展。

Method: QuantEIT结合并行2量子比特电路生成潜在表示作为非线性先验，并通过单线性层重建电导率。

Result: 在模拟和真实2D/3D肺部EIT数据上，QuantEIT优于传统方法，仅用0.2%的参数达到更高精度和抗噪性。

Conclusion: QuantEIT首次将量子电路引入EIT重建，为高效、轻量化的医学成像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba（VM）在长距离依赖捕捉上表现优异，但直接应用ViTs的token缩减技术会导致性能下降。本文提出MTR框架，无需训练即可高效缩减token，显著降低计算量且性能影响小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Mamba的效率，以支持更广泛的应用，但发现直接应用ViTs的token缩减技术会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出MTR框架，基于Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，无需训练即可实现token缩减。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、无需训练的token缩减方法，适用于多种Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Motivation: 探索预训练基础模型在皮肤病分类中的类增量学习潜力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 冻结FM主干，为每个任务训练轻量级MLP；同时探索零训练场景下的原型分类方法。

Result: 方法在性能上优于现有技术（如正则化、回放和架构方法），原型分类也表现良好。

Conclusion: 冻结FM在皮肤病持续学习中表现优异，支持其在医疗领域的广泛应用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐的水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法因偏向性标记选择和静态策略破坏了视觉-文本对齐，导致语义关键概念易受攻击。

Method: 整合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标（局部补丁亲和性、全局语义一致性和上下文注意力模式），动态平衡水印强度与语义保留。

Result: 实验显示，PPL降低7.4%，BLEU提高26.6%，检测AUC达98.8%，攻击抗性96.1%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在监控视频异常检测中取得进展，但涉及敏感数据收集引发隐私问题，研究旨在探讨匿名化技术对检测性能的影响。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、掩码、加密和虚拟化身替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）的性能。

Result: 实验表明，匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些匿名化模式（如加密和掩码）甚至能提升部分模型的AUC性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了算法对匿名化的敏感性，并强调了隐私保护与检测效用之间的权衡，为平衡隐私与检测需求提供了基准和见解。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了一种基于深度学习的自动化软件（Carebot AI Bones）用于测量脊柱侧弯的Cobb角，结果显示其与放射科医生的测量结果高度一致，可用于临床工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量Cobb角耗时且存在观察者间差异，需要一种自动化解决方案。

Method: 研究回顾性评估了Carebot AI Bones软件在103张脊柱X光片上的表现，并与两位放射科医生的测量结果进行对比。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量结果高度一致（MAE约3.9度，Pearson相关系数0.88-0.91），且能准确分类严重程度（Cohen kappa 0.51-0.64）。

Conclusion: 该软件能够复现专家水平的Cobb角测量和分类，有望优化脊柱侧弯的临床报告和分诊流程。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的框架，用于多视角多目标关联，结合图建模与极几何，提升3D重建的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外观特征或几何约束，在目标视觉相似或噪声干扰时易失效。

Method: C-DOG通过连接delta重叠图建模和极几何关联检测，结合IQR过滤和3D反投影误差剔除不一致观测。

Result: 在合成基准测试中，C-DOG优于几何基线，在高目标密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠下表现稳健。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于现实场景中可扩展的3D重建。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 现有专有视觉基础模型（如DINOv2、CLIP等）缺乏透明性，且SSL聚类方法存在语义模糊问题。Franca旨在提供开源高性能模型，并改进聚类和特征表示方法。

Method: 使用公开数据（ImageNet-21K和ReLAION-2B子集），采用透明训练流程。提出多头聚类投影器（基于嵌套Matryoshka表示）和位置解耦策略，优化特征聚类和语义编码。

Result: Franca在多个下游任务中表现优异，性能超越专有模型，同时保持内存高效。

Conclusion: Franca为透明高性能视觉模型设定了新标准，推动了可复现和通用基础模型的发展。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 传统强化学习中奖励函数通常为加性，但现实中许多问题（如路径规划、覆盖控制）的奖励函数表现为次模性。本文旨在解决这类问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于剪枝次模性图的方法，提供可证明的近似解，并分析了其时间和空间复杂度。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法获得的策略比基线方法产生更高的奖励。

Conclusion: 该方法在次模奖励函数的强化学习问题中表现优越，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the
environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some
unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such
that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional
setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in
reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control,
etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled
as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem
where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an
optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed
a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably
approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has
been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a
performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment
setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are
reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed
approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

Conclusion: 为Transformer架构提供了物理基础，深化了其理论理解。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Conclusion: 研究为构建更公平和一致的T2I系统提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在机器学习中使用CDF归一化的优势，通过KANs展示了其优于传统归一化方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习中常用的归一化方法（如均值标准差或固定范围）在金融领域的copula理论中较少使用，而CDF归一化能减少过拟合并简化表示。

Method: 通过将数据转换为CDF(x)进行归一化，应用于Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs)，并与Legendre-KAN对比。

Result: CDF归一化显著提升了KANs的预测性能，同时神经元权重可解释为混合矩，支持概率分布传播和方向调整。

Conclusion: CDF归一化在机器学习中具有潜力，尤其在KANs中表现优异，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Data normalization is crucial in machine learning, usually performed by
subtracting the mean and dividing by standard deviation, or by rescaling to a
fixed range. In copula theory, popular in finance, there is used normalization
to approximately quantiles by transforming x to CDF(x) with estimated CDF
(cumulative distribution function) to nearly uniform distribution in [0,1],
allowing for simpler representations which are less likely to overfit. It seems
nearly unknown in machine learning, therefore, we would like to present some
its advantages on example of recently popular Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs), improving predictions from Legendre-KAN by just switching rescaling to
CDF normalization. Additionally, in HCR interpretation, weights of such neurons
are mixed moments providing local joint distribution models, allow to propagate
also probability distributions, and change propagation direction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为选择性嵌入的新数据加载策略，通过交替加载多源数据片段来提升深度学习模型的泛化能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在非平稳条件和跨域数据中表现不佳，传统数据加载策略限制了泛化或增加了计算成本。

Method: 选择性嵌入策略，交替加载多源数据片段，模仿人类信息处理以减少过拟合。

Result: 在六个时域数据集上验证，分类准确率高且训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多源数据的复杂系统，为实际应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized many industries by enabling models to
automatically learn complex patterns from raw data, reducing dependence on
manual feature engineering. However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to
input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions
and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data.
Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies
either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study
introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates
short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel.
Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics
human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance
generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted
using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method
consistently achieves high classification accuracy across various deep learning
architectures while significantly reducing training times. The approach proves
particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering
a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in
healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness
and adaptability are critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的数据驱动学习方法在处理多保真度数据和不确定性时存在局限性，需要一种更通用的方法以适应不同学习场景。

Method: 提出了一种层次化的方法，从最简单的单保真度确定性神经网络扩展到多保真度方差估计贝叶斯循环神经网络。

Result: 该方法在不同数据驱动的本构建模场景中表现出色，能够准确预测响应、量化模型误差并发现噪声分布（如果存在）。

Conclusion: 该方法为科学和工程领域中的不确定性设计和分析提供了新的机会，尤其是在最具挑战性的场景中。

Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent
multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling
it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical
and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest
single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity
variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and
generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to
different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple
fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method
accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also
discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for
future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains;
especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under
uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于信念函数的聚类算法无法处理复杂数据（如混合数据或时间序列），因为它们依赖于欧几里得空间的性质。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了Soft-ECM算法，通过仅需半度量来定位模糊簇的质心，适用于非欧几里得空间数据。

Result: 实验表明，Soft-ECM在数值数据上的表现与传统模糊聚类方法相当，并能有效处理混合数据和时间序列数据。

Conclusion: Soft-ECM为复杂数据的聚类提供了一种有效解决方案，特别是在结合半度量（如DTW）时表现出优势。

Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in
the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent
uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be
applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or
non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general,
not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use
of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of
barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem
for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which
consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a
semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to
conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate
its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy
clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的可解释框架，用于实时评估空中交通管制员（ATCO）的任务需求，优于现有启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有复杂性指标难以捕捉空中交通的细微操作驱动因素，需要一种更可靠的方法来评估任务需求。

Method: 采用注意力机制的GNN模型，通过静态交通场景中的交互预测即将发布的指令数量，并通过系统性消融飞机来生成任务需求评分。

Result: 该框架显著优于ATCO启发式方法，并比现有基线更可靠地估计场景复杂性。

Conclusion: 该工具能够将任务需求归因于特定飞机，为控制器培训和空域重新设计提供了新的分析手段。

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand
is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing
complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond
simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural
Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts
the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by
ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive
an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating
aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework
significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable
estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool
can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse
and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller
training and airspace redesign.

Motivation: 解决现有基于惯性测量单元（IMU）的HAR方法依赖特定应用标签、泛化性不足的问题，特别是在不同环境或人群中的数据上。

Method: 采用跨模态自监督预训练方法，利用大规模未标记的IMU-视频数据学习表示。

Result: 提出的方法在零样本和少样本评估中优于当前最先进的IMU-视频预训练方法和仅IMU预训练方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在动态数据模态（如IMU信号）中，跨模态预训练可能是学习通用数据表示的有用工具。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

Motivation: 现代自主系统需要高效、安全且可解释的决策方法，而模型无关强化学习在复杂系统中存在样本效率低、学习不安全及可解释性差的问题。

Abstract: Training sophisticated agents for optimal decision-making under uncertainty
has been key to the rapid development of modern autonomous systems across
fields. Notably, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled
decision-making agents to improve their performance directly through system
interactions, with minimal prior knowledge about the system. Yet, model-free RL
has generally relied on agents equipped with deep neural network function
approximators, appealing to the networks' expressivity to capture the agent's
policy and value function for complex systems. However, neural networks amplify
the issues of sample inefficiency, unsafe learning, and limited
interpretability in model-free RL. To this end, this work introduces
model-based agents as a compelling alternative for control policy
approximation, leveraging adaptable models of system dynamics, cost, and
constraints for safe policy learning. These models can encode prior system
knowledge to inform, constrain, and aid in explaining the agent's decisions,
while deficiencies due to model mismatch can be remedied with model-free RL. We
outline the benefits and challenges of learning model-based agents --
exemplified by model predictive control -- and detail the primary learning
approaches: Bayesian optimization, policy search RL, and offline strategies,
along with their respective strengths. While model-free RL has long been
established, its interplay with model-based agents remains largely unexplored,
motivating our perspective on their combined potentials for sample-efficient
learning of safe and interpretable decision-making agents.

<details>

Motivation: 研究ICL的机制，解释LLM如何通过隐藏表示内部化提示的数据生成过程（DGP）结构，超越预训练阶段的学习。

Method: 引入双收敛框架，分析隐藏表示在上下文和层间的收敛过程，证明其对低频表示的隐式偏好。

Result: 理论解释了ICL的鲁棒性、表示几何的全局结构性和局部扭曲性，以及能量衰减现象。

Conclusion: 研究为ICL的机制提供了理论支持，并预测其对高频噪声的鲁棒性，为更广泛的数据分布和设置研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new
behaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent
studies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in
pretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating
process (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the
mechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we
present the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a
unified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge
both over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to
an implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove
analytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical
observations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured
but locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without
vanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness
towards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results
provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical
foundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data
distributions and settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Acoustic Index的新型AI衍生超声心动图参数，用于量化心脏功能障碍，结合了EDMD和混合神经网络，并在736名患者中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超声心动图参数（如EF和GLS）在早期检测心脏功能障碍时存在局限性，需要一种可重复、可解释且操作独立的参数来捕捉细微变化。

Method: 结合EDMD和混合神经网络，从超声心动图序列中提取时空动态特征，并通过注意力机制和流形学习融合临床数据，生成0-1的连续评分。

Result: 在736名患者的独立测试集中，Acoustic Index的AUC为0.89，交叉验证显示敏感性和特异性均超过0.8。

Conclusion: Acoustic Index是一种物理信息驱动的可解释AI生物标志物，有望用于早期检测和监测，未来需进一步验证和优化。

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and
global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of
cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and
GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing
need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that
capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic
parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound
views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on
Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical
metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic
sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via
attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning,
resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac
pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five
folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and
specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based
analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity,
with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker
for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool
for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions
include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to
disease-specific classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用频谱可预测性分数和最大李雅普诺夫指数两种指标，在模型开发前量化时间序列的可预测性，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型评估指标仅在预测后评估性能，而本文旨在在模型开发前评估时间序列的固有可预测性，帮助实践者更高效地规划资源。

Method: 提出频谱可预测性分数评估时间序列的频率成分强度和规律性，以及李雅普诺夫指数量化数据生成系统的混沌性和稳定性。

Result: 在合成和M5竞赛的真实时间序列数据上验证，这两种指标能准确反映时间序列的固有可预测性，并与实际预测性能强相关。

Conclusion: 通过提前评估时间序列的可预测性，实践者可以更高效地分配资源，并为难以预测的产品制定替代策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time
series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the
largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these
measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before
any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength
and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov
exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data.
We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and
real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent
forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual
forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent
forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus
their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more
forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative
strategies for products with limited forecastability.

TL;DR: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代更新注意力权重，提升编码器Transformer的表达能力，无需依赖自回归，实验显示性能提升20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在固定深度下表达能力有限，而自回归方法依赖外部化中间状态。SELF-Transformer旨在通过内部迭代提升表达能力。

Method: 引入SELF-Transformer，通过迭代更新注意力权重至固定点，动态调整计算量以适应输入难度。

Result: 在编码器任务上实现高达20%的准确率提升，且不增加参数量。

Conclusion: SELF-Transformer通过内部迭代恢复了迭代推理的表达能力，同时保持了编码器架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in
expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer
autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and,
more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback
loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in
subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning,
biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as
language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without
resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an
encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed
point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes
the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix
internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This
adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without
increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test
time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget.
Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative
reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为苹果设备和服务提供智能功能，同时确保用户隐私和负责任的人工智能应用。

Method: 设备端模型采用KV缓存共享和2位量化感知训练；服务器模型采用并行轨道混合专家（PT-MoE）架构。训练数据包括网络爬取、授权语料和合成数据，并通过监督微调和强化学习优化。

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that
power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a
3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural
innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and
ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts
PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse
computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality
with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models
are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via
responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data,
then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on
a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional
languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public
benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model
match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation,
constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to
integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements
in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with
safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as
our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private

TL;DR: PLUS框架通过生成用户偏好摘要，实现个性化LLM响应，优于传统RLHF和上下文学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM助手需个性化响应，但传统RLHF无法区分用户差异。

Method: PLUS框架学习用户偏好摘要，动态更新奖励模型，形成在线协同适应循环。

Result: PLUS摘要能有效捕捉用户偏好，适应新用户和多样话题，并可零样本迁移至GPT-4。

Conclusion: PLUS提供透明、可解释的用户摘要，增强LLM对齐的用户控制。

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have
expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to
align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning
from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more
helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it
models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a
novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns
text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past
conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make
personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We
train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the
reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show
that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context
learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful
aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we
show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users
can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary
models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and
portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more
transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新的离线策略评估（OPE）估计器DiPS和DPR，专为匹配市场设计，解决了传统方法在双向用户交互中的方差和稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 匹配市场中的双向用户交互和大规模数据导致传统OPE方法不可靠，需要更有效的评估方法。

Method: 结合直接方法（DM）、逆倾向得分（IPS）和双重稳健（DR）估计器，引入中间标签（如初始参与信号）以优化偏差-方差控制。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，DiPS和DPR在偏差和方差控制上优于传统方法，并能扩展到离线策略学习。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在匹配市场的离线评估和学习任务中表现优越，适用于实际平台如求职匹配。

Abstract: Matching users based on mutual preferences is a fundamental aspect of
services driven by reciprocal recommendations, such as job search and dating
applications. Although A/B tests remain the gold standard for evaluating new
policies in recommender systems for matching markets, it is costly and
impractical for frequent policy updates. Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) thus plays
a crucial role by enabling the evaluation of recommendation policies using only
offline logged data naturally collected on the platform. However, unlike
conventional recommendation settings, the large scale and bidirectional nature
of user interactions in matching platforms introduce variance issues and
exacerbate reward sparsity, making standard OPE methods unreliable. To address
these challenges and facilitate effective offline evaluation, we propose novel
OPE estimators, \textit{DiPS} and \textit{DPR}, specifically designed for
matching markets. Our methods combine elements of the Direct Method (DM),
Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), and Doubly Robust (DR) estimators while
incorporating intermediate labels, such as initial engagement signals, to
achieve better bias-variance control in matching markets. Theoretically, we
derive the bias and variance of the proposed estimators and demonstrate their
advantages over conventional methods. Furthermore, we show that these
estimators can be seamlessly extended to offline policy learning methods for
improving recommendation policies for making more matches. We empirically
evaluate our methods through experiments on both synthetic data and A/B testing
logs from a real job-matching platform. The empirical results highlight the
superiority of our approach over existing methods in off-policy evaluation and
learning tasks for a variety of configurations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer的Tri-GFN框架，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略提升图聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCN模型在处理大规模复杂图数据时存在过平滑和过压缩问题，Graph Transformer在异构图数据上性能有限。

Method: 提出Tri-GFN框架，整合GCN、AE和Graph Transformer，通过三学习机制和特征融合策略增强全局与局部信息的区分性和一致性。

Result: 在ACM、Reuters和USPS数据集上分别提升0.87%、14.14%和7.58%的准确率，尤其在Reuters数据集表现突出。

Conclusion: Tri-GFN框架显著提升了图聚类性能，适用于新闻自动分类和主题检索等领域。

Abstract: In recent years, models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) have made
significant strides in the field of graph data analysis. However, challenges
such as over-smoothing and over-compression remain when handling large-scale
and complex graph datasets, leading to a decline in clustering quality.
Although the Graph Transformer architecture has mitigated some of these issues,
its performance is still limited when processing heterogeneous graph data. To
address these challenges, this study proposes a novel deep clustering framework
that comprising GCN, Autoencoder (AE), and Graph Transformer, termed the
Tri-Learn Graph Fusion Network (Tri-GFN). This framework enhances the
differentiation and consistency of global and local information through a
unique tri-learning mechanism and feature fusion enhancement strategy. The
framework integrates GCN, AE, and Graph Transformer modules. These components
are meticulously fused by a triple-channel enhancement module, which maximizes
the use of both node attributes and topological structures, ensuring robust
clustering representation. The tri-learning mechanism allows mutual learning
among these modules, while the feature fusion strategy enables the model to
capture complex relationships, yielding highly discriminative representations
for graph clustering. It surpasses many state-of-the-art methods, achieving an
accuracy improvement of approximately 0.87% on the ACM dataset, 14.14 % on the
Reuters dataset, and 7.58 % on the USPS dataset. Due to its outstanding
performance on the Reuters dataset, Tri-GFN can be applied to automatic news
classification, topic retrieval, and related fields.

TL;DR: FedSkipTwin是一种基于服务器端数字孪生的客户端跳过算法，通过预测梯度更新的幅度和不确定性来减少通信开销，在非IID数据分布下显著节省带宽并提升模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的通信开销是主要瓶颈，尤其是移动和物联网设备带宽受限的场景。

Method: 使用轻量级LSTM数字孪生预测客户端梯度更新的幅度和不确定性，仅在预测值超过阈值时请求通信，否则跳过轮次。

Result: 在UCI-HAR和MNIST数据集上，FedSkipTwin减少12-15.5%的通信量，同时模型精度提升0.5个百分点。

Conclusion: 预测引导的跳过策略是带宽受限边缘环境中资源感知联邦学习的实用有效方法。

Abstract: Communication overhead remains a primary bottleneck in federated learning
(FL), particularly for applications involving mobile and IoT devices with
constrained bandwidth. This work introduces FedSkipTwin, a novel
client-skipping algorithm driven by lightweight, server-side digital twins.
Each twin, implemented as a simple LSTM, observes a client's historical
sequence of gradient norms to forecast both the magnitude and the epistemic
uncertainty of its next update. The server leverages these predictions,
requesting communication only when either value exceeds a predefined threshold;
otherwise, it instructs the client to skip the round, thereby saving bandwidth.
Experiments are conducted on the UCI-HAR and MNIST datasets with 10 clients
under a non-IID data distribution. The results demonstrate that FedSkipTwin
reduces total communication by 12-15.5% across 20 rounds while simultaneously
improving final model accuracy by up to 0.5 percentage points compared to the
standard FedAvg algorithm. These findings establish that prediction-guided
skipping is a practical and effective strategy for resource-aware FL in
bandwidth-constrained edge environments.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Conclusion: GRU-KAN和LSTM-KAN能有效提升贷款违约的早期预测能力，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This study addresses a critical challenge in time series anomaly detection:
enhancing the predictive capability of loan default models more than three
months in advance to enable early identification of default events, helping
financial institutions implement preventive measures before risk events
materialize. Existing methods have significant drawbacks, such as their lack of
accuracy in early predictions and their dependence on training and testing
within the same year and specific time frames. These issues limit their
practical use, particularly with out-of-time data. To address these, the study
introduces two innovative architectures, GRU-KAN and LSTM-KAN, which merge
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed models were evaluated against
the baseline models (LSTM, GRU, LSTM-Attention, and LSTM-Transformer) in terms
of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC in different lengths of feature
window, sample sizes, and early prediction intervals. The results demonstrate
that the proposed model achieves a prediction accuracy of over 92% three months

existing baselines.

Result: 改进方法显著提升了PI-GNNs在高密度图问题中的性能。

Conclusion: 通过模糊逻辑和二值化神经网络的策略，可以有效解决PI-GNNs在高密度图中的性能问题。

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an
efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization
problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting
dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded
promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the
performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of
the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase
transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate
solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the
relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To
address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive
strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized
neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed
methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense
settings.

Motivation: 探索MOBO在分子设计中的实际优势，尤其是与标量化方法相比。

Method: 使用基于帕累托的MOBO策略（EHVI）与固定权重的标量化方法（EI）进行对比实验。

Result: EHVI在帕累托前沿覆盖、收敛速度和化学多样性上均优于EI。

Conclusion: Pareto-aware策略在分子优化中具有实际优势，尤其在数据有限且权衡复杂时。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) provides a principled framework
for navigating trade-offs in molecular design. However, its empirical
advantages over scalarized alternatives remain underexplored. We benchmark a
simple Pareto-based MOBO strategy -- Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) --
against a simple fixed-weight scalarized baseline using Expected Improvement
(EI), under a tightly controlled setup with identical Gaussian Process
surrogates and molecular representations. Across three molecular optimization
tasks, EHVI consistently outperforms scalarized EI in terms of Pareto front
coverage, convergence speed, and chemical diversity. While scalarization
encompasses flexible variants -- including random or adaptive schemes -- our
results show that even strong deterministic instantiations can underperform in
low-data regimes. These findings offer concrete evidence for the practical
advantages of Pareto-aware acquisition in de novo molecular optimization,
especially when evaluation budgets are limited and trade-offs are nontrivial.

Conclusion: AST方法通过高效标记化和注意力机制，实现了可扩展且准确的可变形体交互模拟，并贡献了新的大规模数据集。

Abstract: Simulating interactions between deformable bodies is vital in fields like
material science, mechanical design, and robotics. While learning-based methods
with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective at solving complex physical
systems, they encounter scalability issues when modeling deformable body
interactions. To model interactions between objects, pairwise global edges have
to be created dynamically, which is computationally intensive and impractical
for large-scale meshes. To overcome these challenges, drawing on insights from
geometric representations, we propose an Adaptive Spatial Tokenization (AST)
method for efficient representation of physical states. By dividing the
simulation space into a grid of cells and mapping unstructured meshes onto this
structured grid, our approach naturally groups adjacent mesh nodes. We then
apply a cross-attention module to map the sparse cells into a compact,
fixed-length embedding, serving as tokens for the entire physical state.
Self-attention modules are employed to predict the next state over these tokens
in latent space. This framework leverages the efficiency of tokenization and
the expressive power of attention mechanisms to achieve accurate and scalable
simulation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in modeling deformable
body interactions. Notably, it remains effective on large-scale simulations
with meshes exceeding 100,000 nodes, where existing methods are hindered by
computational limitations. Additionally, we contribute a novel large-scale
dataset encompassing a wide range of deformable body interactions to support
future research in this area.

Abstract: To address the challenges posed by cascading reactions caused by component

Sentence-BERT to quantify the semantic association between failure impact and
emergency decision-making. The dataset covers 12 systems, 1,262 failure modes,

achieves a classification accuracy of 0.735, comparable to existing benchmarks.
Additionally, a silhouette coefficient of 0.641 indicates that the features are

Result: 结果显示，输出空间攻击的对抗训练显著提升了模型在干净测试数据上的性能（平均提升10.5%），同时增强了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗训练在音频分类中具有潜力，能够同时应对数据分布偏移和对抗攻击的挑战。

Abstract: Adversarial training is a promising strategy for enhancing model robustness
against adversarial attacks. However, its impact on generalization under
substantial data distribution shifts in audio classification remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, this work investigates how different
adversarial training strategies improve generalization performance and
adversarial robustness in audio classification. The study focuses on two model
architectures: a conventional convolutional neural network (ConvNeXt) and an
inherently interpretable prototype-based model (AudioProtoPNet). The approach
is evaluated using a challenging bird sound classification benchmark. This
benchmark is characterized by pronounced distribution shifts between training
and test data due to varying environmental conditions and recording methods, a
common real-world challenge. The investigation explores two adversarial
training strategies: one based on output-space attacks that maximize the
classification loss function, and another based on embedding-space attacks
designed to maximize embedding dissimilarity. These attack types are also used
for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for AudioProtoPNet, the study assesses
the stability of its learned prototypes under targeted embedding-space attacks.
Results show that adversarial training, particularly using output-space
attacks, improves clean test data performance by an average of 10.5% relative
and simultaneously strengthens the adversarial robustness of the models. These
findings, although derived from the bird sound domain, suggest that adversarial
training holds potential to enhance robustness against both strong distribution
shifts and adversarial attacks in challenging audio classification settings.

Motivation: 现实中的图数据常存在类别和大小不平衡问题，影响模型学习效果，现有方法通常只能解决一种不平衡或计算成本高。

Method: SamGoG通过重要性采样机制构建多个图结构，并利用可学习的相似性和自适应节点度增强边同质性。

Result: 实验表明，SamGoG在基准数据集上实现最高15.66%的准确率提升，并加速训练6.7倍。

Conclusion: SamGoG能高效解决图分类中的不平衡问题，且兼容多种下游GNN模型。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph
classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based
representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of
imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias
the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically
address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this
work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning
framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance.
SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling
mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates
the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge
homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly
integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for
graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a
15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more
advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational
demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained
environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory
usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the

employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research
introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based
semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to
search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using
the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic
quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for
PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on
the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new
state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining
an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately

Abstract: Advances in deep learning for molecular generation show promise in
accelerating drug discovery. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) have recently shown
impressive performance across diverse chemical tasks, with their success often
ascribed to the paradigm of modeling in a low-variance parameter space.
However, the Bayesian inference-based strategy imposes limitations on designing
more flexible distribution transformation pathways, making it challenging to
adapt to diverse data distributions and varied task requirements. Furthermore,
the potential for simpler, more efficient parameter-space-based models is
unexplored. To address this, we propose a novel Parameter Interpolation Flow
model (named PIF) with detailed theoretical foundation, training, and inference
procedures. We then develop MolPIF for structure-based drug design,
demonstrating its superior performance across diverse metrics compared to
baselines. This work validates the effectiveness of parameter-space-based
generative modeling paradigm for molecules and offers new perspectives for
model design.

Abstract: Graph clustering is crucial for unraveling intricate data structures, yet it
presents significant challenges due to its unsupervised nature. Recently,
goal-directed clustering techniques have yielded impressive results, with
contrastive learning methods leveraging pseudo-label garnering considerable
attention. Nonetheless, pseudo-label as a supervision signal is unreliable and
existing goal-directed approaches utilize only features to construct a
single-target distribution for single-center optimization, which lead to
incomplete and less dependable guidance. In our work, we propose a novel
Dual-Center Graph Clustering (DCGC) approach based on neighbor distribution
properties, which includes representation learning with neighbor distribution
and dual-center optimization. Specifically, we utilize neighbor distribution as
a supervision signal to mine hard negative samples in contrastive learning,
which is reliable and enhances the effectiveness of representation learning.
Furthermore, neighbor distribution center is introduced alongside feature
center to jointly construct a dual-target distribution for dual-center
optimization. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate superior
performance and effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Due to the computational complexity of evaluating interatomic forces from
first principles, the creation of interatomic machine learning force fields has
become a highly active field of research. However, the generation of training
datasets of sufficient size and sample diversity itself comes with a
computational burden that can make this approach impractical for modeling rare
events or systems with a large configuration space. Fine-tuning foundation
models that have been pre-trained on large-scale material or molecular
databases offers a promising opportunity to reduce the amount of training data
necessary to reach a desired level of accuracy. However, even if this approach
requires less training data overall, creating a suitable training dataset can
still be a very challenging problem, especially for systems with rare events
and for end-users who don't have an extensive background in machine learning.
In on-the-fly learning, the creation of a training dataset can be largely
automated by using model uncertainty during the simulation to decide if the
model is accurate enough or if a structure should be recalculated with
classical methods and used to update the model. A key challenge for applying
this form of active learning to the fine-tuning of foundation models is how to
assess the uncertainty of those models during the fine-tuning process, even
though most foundation models lack any form of uncertainty quantification. In
this paper, we overcome this challenge by introducing a fine-tuning approach
based on Bayesian neural network methods and a subsequent on-the-fly workflow
that automatically fine-tunes the model while maintaining a pre-specified
accuracy and can detect rare events such as transition states and sample them
at an increased rate relative to their occurrence.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in
biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses,
and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely
on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that
are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data.
Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the
structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of
state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data
for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on
different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure
of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for
downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene
expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively
capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The
results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform
traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by
reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis
of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and
limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending
on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to
enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene
expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk
RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经因果模型多假设静态因果图，忽略了因果交互的动态性，因此需要一种新理论来填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Causal Process框架，并将其实现为Causal Process Model；在RL环境中通过类似Transformer注意力机制的代理构建动态因果图假设。

Result: 在RL环境中，该方法在因果表示学习和代理性能上优于现有方法，并能唯一恢复动态因果过程图。

Conclusion: Causal Process框架为动态因果结构提供了新理论支持，其实现模型在RL中表现出色，推动了可解释因果推理的发展。

Abstract: Formal frameworks of causality have operated largely parallel to modern
trends in deep reinforcement learning (RL). However, there has been a revival
of interest in formally grounding the representations learned by neural
networks in causal concepts. Yet, most attempts at neural models of causality
assume static causal graphs and ignore the dynamic nature of causal
interactions. In this work, we introduce Causal Process framework as a novel
theory for representing dynamic hypotheses about causal structure. Furthermore,
we present Causal Process Model as an implementation of this framework. This
allows us to reformulate the attention mechanism popularized by Transformer
networks within an RL setting with the goal to infer interpretable causal
processes from visual observations. Here, causal inference corresponds to
constructing a causal graph hypothesis which itself becomes an RL task nested
within the original RL problem. To create an instance of such hypothesis, we
employ RL agents. These agents establish links between units similar to the
original Transformer attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach in an RL environment where we outperform current alternatives in
causal representation learning and agent performance, and uniquely recover
graphs of dynamic causal processes.

Conclusion: MoDyGAN为生物分子模拟提供了高效构象采样方法，并有望扩展到其他复杂3D结构。

Abstract: Extensively exploring protein conformational landscapes remains a major
challenge in computational biology due to the high computational cost involved
in dynamic physics-based simulations. In this work, we propose a novel
pipeline, MoDyGAN, that leverages molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore protein conformational
spaces. MoDyGAN contains a generator that maps Gaussian distributions into
MD-derived protein trajectories, and a refinement module that combines ensemble
learning with a dual-discriminator to further improve the plausibility of
generated conformations. Central to our approach is an innovative
representation technique that reversibly transforms 3D protein structures into
2D matrices, enabling the use of advanced image-based GAN architectures. We use
three rigid proteins to demonstrate that MoDyGAN can generate plausible new
conformations. We also use deca-alanine as a case study to show that
interpolations within the latent space closely align with trajectories obtained
from steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations. Our results suggest that
representing proteins as image-like data unlocks new possibilities for applying
advanced deep learning techniques to biomolecular simulation, leading to an
efficient sampling of conformational states. Additionally, the proposed
framework holds strong potential for extension to other complex 3D structures.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex domains poses significant challenges due to the
need for extensive labeled data and the inherently imbalanced nature of
anomalous versus benign samples. Graph-based machine learning models have
emerged as a promising solution that combines attribute and relational data to
uncover intricate patterns. However, the scarcity of anomalous data exacerbates
the challenge, which requires innovative strategies to enhance model learning
with limited information. In this paper, we hypothesize that the incorporation
of the influence of the nodes, quantified through average controllability, can
significantly improve the performance of anomaly detection. We propose two
novel approaches to integrate average controllability into graph-based
frameworks: (1) using average controllability as an edge weight and (2)
encoding it as a one-hot edge attribute vector. Through rigorous evaluation on
real-world and synthetic networks with six state-of-the-art baselines, our
proposed methods demonstrate improved performance in identifying anomalies,
highlighting the critical role of controllability measures in enhancing the
performance of graph machine learning models. This work underscores the
potential of integrating average controllability as additional metrics to
address the challenges of anomaly detection in sparse and imbalanced datasets.

Abstract: The work in this paper describes the training and evaluation of machine
learning (ML) techniques for the classification of cuneiform signs. There is a
lot of variability in cuneiform signs, depending on where they come from, for
what and by whom they were written, but also how they were digitized. This
variability makes it unlikely that an ML model trained on one dataset will
perform successfully on another dataset. This contribution studies how such
differences impact that performance. Based on our results and insights, we aim
to influence future data acquisition standards and provide a solid foundation
for future cuneiform sign classification tasks. The ML model has been trained
and tested on handwritten Old Babylonian (c. 2000-1600 B.C.E.) documentary
texts inscribed on clay tablets originating from three Mesopotamian cities
(Nippur, D\=ur-Abie\v{s}uh and Sippar). The presented and analysed model is
ResNet50, which achieves a top-1 score of 87.1% and a top-5 score of 96.5% for
signs with at least 20 instances. As these automatic classification results are
the first on Old Babylonian texts, there are currently no comparable results.

Abstract: Small sample sizes in neuroimaging in general, and in structural connectome
(SC) studies in particular limit the development of reliable biomarkers for
neurological and psychiatric disorders - such as Alzheimer's disease and
schizophrenia - by reducing statistical power, reliability, and
generalizability. Large-scale multi-site studies have exist, but they have
acquisition-related biases due to scanner heterogeneity, compromising imaging
consistency and downstream analyses. While existing SC harmonization methods -
such as linear regression (LR), ComBat, and deep learning techniques - mitigate
these biases, they often rely on detailed metadata, traveling subjects (TS), or
overlook the graph-topology of SCs. To address these limitations, we propose a
site-conditioned deep harmonization framework that harmonizes SCs across
diverse acquisition sites without requiring metadata or TS that we test in a
simulated scenario based on the Human Connectome Dataset. Within this
framework, we benchmark three deep architectures - a fully connected
autoencoder (AE), a convolutional AE, and a graph convolutional AE - against a
top-performing LR baseline. While non-graph models excel in edge-weight
prediction and edge existence detection, the graph AE demonstrates superior
preservation of topological structure and subject-level individuality, as
reflected by graph metrics and fingerprinting accuracy, respectively. Although
the LR baseline achieves the highest numerical performance by explicitly
modeling acquisition parameters, it lacks applicability to real-world
multi-site use cases as detailed acquisition metadata is often unavailable. Our
results highlight the critical role of model architecture in SC harmonization
performance and demonstrate that graph-based approaches are particularly
well-suited for structure-aware, domain-generalizable SC harmonization in
large-scale multi-site SC studies.

Motivation: 现有方法在时间序列预测中对长短期依赖赋予等权重并不理想，需要更灵活的权重分配机制。

Method: 提出ParallelTime Weighter动态计算长短期依赖的权重，并设计ParallelTime架构，结合局部窗口注意力和Mamba。

Result: ParallelTime在多个基准测试中表现优异，计算效率高，参数少，且能适应更长的预测范围。

Conclusion: ParallelTime为并行Attention-Mamba在时间序列预测中的未来发展提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Modern multivariate time series forecasting primarily relies on two
architectures: the Transformer with attention mechanism and Mamba. In natural
language processing, an approach has been used that combines local window
attention for capturing short-term dependencies and Mamba for capturing
long-term dependencies, with their outputs averaged to assign equal weight to
both. We find that for time-series forecasting tasks, assigning equal weight to
long-term and short-term dependencies is not optimal. To mitigate this, we
propose a dynamic weighting mechanism, ParallelTime Weighter, which calculates
interdependent weights for long-term and short-term dependencies for each token
based on the input and the model's knowledge. Furthermore, we introduce the
ParallelTime architecture, which incorporates the ParallelTime Weighter
mechanism to deliver state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.
Our architecture demonstrates robustness, achieves lower FLOPs, requires fewer
parameters, scales effectively to longer prediction horizons, and significantly
outperforms existing methods. These advances highlight a promising path for
future developments of parallel Attention-Mamba in time series forecasting. The
implementation is readily available at:

Motivation: 研究动机是理解基于对偶公式的CVaR优化方法失败的根本原因，并探索政策评估中的问题。

Method: 方法是通过政策评估框架分析静态CVaR，提出风险分配一致性约束，并量化评估误差（CVaR评估间隙）。

Result: 结果表明，对偶CVaR分解方法在寻找全局最优策略时存在根本性限制，且某些MDP中不存在单一最优策略。

Conclusion: 结论是风险分配视角揭示了CVaR优化方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that dynamic programming (DP) methods for finding
static CVaR-optimal policies in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) can fail when
based on the dual formulation, yet the root cause for the failure has remained
unclear. We expand on these findings by shifting focus from policy optimization
to the seemingly simpler task of policy evaluation. We show that evaluating the
static CVaR of a given policy can be framed as two distinct minimization
problems. For their solutions to match, a set of ``risk-assignment consistency
constraints'' must be satisfied, and we demonstrate that the intersection of
the constraints being empty is the source of previously observed evaluation
errors. Quantifying the evaluation error as the CVaR evaluation gap, we then
demonstrate that the issues observed when optimizing over the dual-based CVaR
DP are explained by the returned policy having a non-zero CVaR evaluation gap.
We then leverage our proposed risk-assignment perspective to prove that the
search for a single, uniformly optimal policy via on the dual CVaR
decomposition is fundamentally limited, identifying an MDP where no single
policy can be optimal across all initial risk levels.

Abstract: In this paper, we study Byzantine-resilient federated online learning for
Gaussian process regression (GPR). We develop a Byzantine-resilient federated
GPR algorithm that allows a cloud and a group of agents to collaboratively
learn a latent function and improve the learning performances where some agents
exhibit Byzantine failures, i.e., arbitrary and potentially adversarial
behavior. Each agent-based local GPR sends potentially compromised local
predictions to the cloud, and the cloud-based aggregated GPR computes a global
model by a Byzantine-resilient product of experts aggregation rule. Then the
cloud broadcasts the current global model to all the agents. Agent-based fused
GPR refines local predictions by fusing the received global model with that of
the agent-based local GPR. Moreover, we quantify the learning accuracy
improvements of the agent-based fused GPR over the agent-based local GPR.
Experiments on a toy example and two medium-scale real-world datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the performances of the proposed algorithm.

TL;DR: DONUT是一种物理感知神经网络，用于快速自动分析纳米束衍射数据，无需标记数据集或预训练，效率比传统方法高200倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时分析纳米束衍射数据存在瓶颈，主要受限于伪影和高计算需求，传统方法效率低下。

Method: DONUT结合可微分几何衍射模型，通过无监督训练实时预测晶格应变和取向。

Result: 实验证明DONUT能准确提取数据特征，效率比传统拟合方法高200倍。

Conclusion: DONUT解决了X射线科学中监督学习的局限性，为实时分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Coherent X-ray scattering techniques are critical for investigating the
fundamental structural properties of materials at the nanoscale. While
advancements have made these experiments more accessible, real-time analysis
remains a significant bottleneck, often hindered by artifacts and computational
demands. In scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy, which is widely used to
spatially resolve structural heterogeneities, this challenge is compounded by
the convolution of the divergent beam with the sample's local structure. To
address this, we introduce DONUT (Diffraction with Optics for Nanobeam by
Unsupervised Training), a physics-aware neural network designed for the rapid
and automated analysis of nanobeam diffraction data. By incorporating a
differentiable geometric diffraction model directly into its architecture,
DONUT learns to predict crystal lattice strain and orientation in real-time.
Crucially, this is achieved without reliance on labeled datasets or
pre-training, overcoming a fundamental limitation for supervised machine
learning in X-ray science. We demonstrate experimentally that DONUT accurately
extracts all features within the data over 200 times more efficiently than
conventional fitting methods.

TL;DR: 论文研究了持续学习中的稳定性间隙问题，提出了一种基于不确定性调节增益的动态机制来平衡知识整合与干扰最小化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中存在稳定性间隙，即在掌握新任务时对已掌握任务的性能下降，这与持续学习的目标相矛盾。研究旨在解决这一不平衡问题。

Method: 受生物大脑多时间尺度动态启发，提出不确定性调节增益动态机制，模拟两时间尺度优化器。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR基准测试中，该机制有效减少了稳定性间隙。

Conclusion: 增益调制机制模拟了去甲肾上腺素功能，为减少稳定性间隙和提升持续学习性能提供了机制性见解。

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in
performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the
stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning,
revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably,
persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within
this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other
sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid
adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to
investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual
learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating
concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to
modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native
multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam
introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps.
Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently
enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we
propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that
approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of
knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We
evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of
the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that
uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap.
Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic
functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing
stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标强化学习依赖预定义的奖励函数，难以平衡冲突目标且易简化问题。偏好作为更灵活的决策指导，可替代复杂奖励设计。

Method: 论文提出Pb-MORL，将偏好整合到MORL框架中，构建与偏好对齐的多目标奖励模型，并证明优化该模型等价于训练Pareto最优策略。

Result: 在多个基准任务和实际应用中，Pb-MORL表现优异，甚至优于使用真实奖励函数的方法。

Conclusion: Pb-MORL展示了在复杂现实系统中应用的潜力，为多目标优化提供了更灵活、直观的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is a structured approach for
optimizing tasks with multiple objectives. However, it often relies on
pre-defined reward functions, which can be hard to design for balancing
conflicting goals and may lead to oversimplification. Preferences can serve as
more flexible and intuitive decision-making guidance, eliminating the need for
complicated reward design. This paper introduces preference-based MORL
(Pb-MORL), which formalizes the integration of preferences into the MORL
framework. We theoretically prove that preferences can derive policies across
the entire Pareto frontier. To guide policy optimization using preferences, our
method constructs a multi-objective reward model that aligns with the given
preferences. We further provide theoretical proof to show that optimizing this
reward model is equivalent to training the Pareto optimal policy. Extensive
experiments in benchmark multi-objective tasks, a multi-energy management task,
and an autonomous driving task on a multi-line highway show that our method
performs competitively, surpassing the oracle method, which uses the ground
truth reward function. This highlights its potential for practical applications
in complex real-world systems.

Conclusion: DPMT框架有效解决了人类-AI协作中AI对复杂人类心理特征建模的挑战。

Abstract: Real-time human-artificial intelligence (AI) collaboration is crucial yet
challenging, especially when AI agents must adapt to diverse and unseen human
behaviors in dynamic scenarios. Existing large language model (LLM) agents
often fail to accurately model the complex human mental characteristics such as
domain intentions, especially in the absence of direct communication. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel dual process multi-scale theory of
mind (DPMT) framework, drawing inspiration from cognitive science dual process
theory. Our DPMT framework incorporates a multi-scale theory of mind (ToM)
module to facilitate robust human partner modeling through mental
characteristic reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that DPMT
significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, and ablation studies further
validate the contributions of our multi-scale ToM in the slow system.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) 在类别不平衡分类中表现优于标准神经网络（MLPs），但传统不平衡策略与其数学结构冲突，且计算成本高。MLPs 结合不平衡技术与 KANs 性能相当，但资源消耗更低。

Motivation: 探索 KANs 在不平衡分类任务中的潜力，并与传统方法对比。

Method: 在十个基准数据集上对 KANs 和 MLPs 进行实证评估，测试其在不平衡数据上的表现及对传统不平衡策略的适应性。

Result: KANs 在原始不平衡数据上表现优于 MLPs，但传统不平衡策略会显著降低其性能，且计算成本高。MLPs 结合不平衡技术与 KANs 性能相当。

Conclusion: KANs 适用于资源充足的原始不平衡数据场景，但需进一步优化其架构和计算效率以提升实用性。

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in
neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard
neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context
of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe
that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively
than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However,
conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical
structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade
KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from
prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains.
Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve
equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs.
These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw
imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource
tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently
limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as
developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning,
optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict
with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next
generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Motivation: 现实世界中的数据常为高维且不规则，传统方法难以有效提取关键信息，需要一种新方法来建模因果表示并处理不规则张量。

Method: 提出CaRTeD框架，整合时间因果表示学习与非规则张量分解，提供灵活的正则化设计，并证明算法收敛性。

Conclusion: CaRTeD填补了非规则张量分解理论保证的空白，为下游任务提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering
complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as
low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are
high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of
irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is
critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information.
In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the
transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set
of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that
integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor
decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks
using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and
extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design
to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm
converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in
theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor
decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic
health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both
phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability
of causal representations.

Result: 自动评估显示，CodeEdu显著提高了学生的编程表现。

Conclusion: CodeEdu展示了多代理LLM在教育领域的潜力，为编程教育提供了更高效和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in
improving coding education by providing support for code writing, explanation,
and debugging. However, existing LLM-based approaches generally fail to assess
students' abilities, design learning plans, provide personalized material
aligned with individual learning goals, and enable interactive learning.
Current work mostly uses single LLM agents, which limits their ability to
understand complex code repositories and schedule step-by-step tutoring. Recent
research has shown that multi-agent LLMs can collaborate to solve complicated
problems in various domains like software engineering, but their potential in
the field of education remains unexplored. In this work, we introduce CodeEdu,
an innovative multi-agent collaborative platform that combines LLMs with tool
use to provide proactive and personalized education in coding. Unlike static
pipelines, CodeEdu dynamically allocates agents and tasks to meet student
needs. Various agents in CodeEdu undertake certain functions specifically,
including task planning, personalized material generation, real-time QA,
step-by-step tutoring, code execution, debugging, and learning report
generation, facilitated with extensive external tools to improve task
efficiency. Automated evaluations reveal that CodeEdu substantially enhances
students' coding performance.

Method: 生成图像摘要以增强语义理解，利用大型多模态模型进行语义增强，设计专家情感推理模块优化情感特征。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，SEER优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SEER通过语义增强和情感推理有效提升了多模态假新闻检测性能。

Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application
of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement
effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional
features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to
contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel
Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake
news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic
understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic
enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity
and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that
simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the
authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 为在不确定负载下工作的柔性系统提供了精确硬停止设计的基础，推动了柔性机构在实际系统中的应用。

Abstract: Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due
to their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent
vulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of
compliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly
challenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and
the cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical
to prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on
stacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to
guarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a
systematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in
compliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a
single pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a
theoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry
to maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that
the mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method
to a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and
provide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers
reliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work
establishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems
operating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the
application of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems.

Abstract: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been
well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation
is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task
instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach
poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the
performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of
robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully
compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask
self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into
different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our
multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a
compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation
trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of
robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation
behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the
proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Motivation: 随着输入空间复杂度增加，传统进化方法学习效率急剧下降，需解决高维输入问题。

Method: 利用DCT截断输入矩阵的特征系数，降低输入维度，保留关键特征。

Result: SCOPE将输入数据从2700压缩到54，提升算法效率20%。

Conclusion: SCOPE能显著压缩输入数据，提高进化控制器的学习效果。

Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning
method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these
algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space
becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the
solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more
complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input
matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce
the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of
the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using
SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a
matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are
then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the
addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.
SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series
pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of
compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension
is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates
that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an
evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.

Qualitatively, users with robotics experience preferred our controller, and the

Conclusion: PE-PSO适用于复杂环境下的实时多无人机协同操作，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due
to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens
capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a
surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule
and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic
system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a
standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe
on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time
tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system
enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with
in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still
current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate
effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five
experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square
errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was
performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of Inside and Outside Control modes at
various scaling factors in a simulated vitreoretinal surgical setting. The
IRISS teleoperated surgical system's console (cockpit) was adapted to project a
simulated microscope view of an intraocular setup to a virtual reality (VR)
headset. Five experienced vitreoretinal surgeons and five engineers with no
surgical experience used the system to perform tasks common to vitreoretinal
surgery. Experimental results indicate that Inside Control methods at higher
scaling factors (20 or 30) achieved the best performance overall, though the
optimal scaling factor may vary by task and complexity. Optimizing control
methods and scaling factors could lead to improvements in surgical efficiency
and accuracy, as well as minimize risks in future robotic-assisted intraocular
procedures.

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and adaptive control framework for legged
robots that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a biologically
inspired torque library (TL), analogous to muscle memory. The proposed method
addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory
tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the
repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the
framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion
scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based
model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time
learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A
central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned
control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and
gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and
significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the
bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations
and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework
reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables
reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope
traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body
controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation
during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of
existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC
with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged
locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot localization is a crucial task for implementing multi-robot
systems. Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot
localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless,
characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance
measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently
considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the
odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently,
long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot
localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware
pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization.
Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range
error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions
between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing
long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose
correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and
visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in
real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems play an increasingly vital role in a wide range of
applications, particularly for transport and delivery tasks in complex
environments. In airdrop missions, these platforms face the dual challenges of
abrupt control mode switching and inherent system delays along with control
errors. To address these issues, this paper presents an autonomous airdrop
system based on an aerial manipulator (AM). The introduction of additional
actuated degrees of freedom enables active compensation for UAV tracking
errors. By imposing smooth and continuous constraints on the parabolic landing
point, the proposed approach generates aerial throwing trajectories that are
less sensitive to the timing of payload release. A hierarchical disturbance
compensation strategy is incorporated into the Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (NMPC) framework to mitigate the effects of sudden changes in system
parameters, while the predictive capabilities of NMPC are further exploited to
improve the precision of aerial throwing. Both simulation and real-world
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves greater
agility and precision in airdrop missions.

Abstract: Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a significant challenge in
robotics. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often face a
dilemma. Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of
other agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while
centralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making.
To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
Learning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method
provides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration
spaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents.
We further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that
incorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We
demonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the
solution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex
collision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical
systems, including a 12-dimensional dual-arm setup, and outperforms a range of
state-of-the-art techniques in successfully addressing challenging MAMP tasks.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate
objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that
requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown
remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract
representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable
low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in
resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp
Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on
the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware
techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and
quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark
validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the
potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

Conclusion: MISO在解决复杂优化问题中表现出色，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various
fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm
is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

Abstract: The use of autonomous robots in space is an essential part of the "New Space"
commercial ecosystem of assembly and re-use of space hardware components in
Earth orbit and beyond. The STARFAB project aims to create a ground
demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable
commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous
robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the
condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB
facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile
Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it
can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot,
and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on
STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a
thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A
grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by
an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still
ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations
for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the
mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for

Conclusion: 动态调整几何表示使机器人能更灵活应对任务需求，提升碰撞检测、交互模拟和导航能力。

Abstract: What if a robot could rethink its own morphological representation to better
meet the demands of diverse tasks? Most robotic systems today treat their
physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing
the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly
different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a
novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives
that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or
inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic
gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides
explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline
approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis
Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation
with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show
enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich
interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically
adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit
their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible
parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where
physical form must continuously balance precision with computational
tractability.

Abstract: Autonomous motion planning is critical for efficient and safe underwater
manipulation in dynamic marine environments. Current motion planning methods
often fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to
real-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we
introduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a
Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning
for autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic
Roadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite
cost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and
execution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the
search space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time
planning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update
uncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental
conditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through
extensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages
of our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This
probabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous
underwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic
marine challenges.

Abstract: Audio-based music structure analysis (MSA) is an essential task in Music
Information Retrieval that remains challenging due to the complexity and
variability of musical form. Recent advances highlight the potential of
fine-tuning pre-trained music foundation models for MSA tasks. However, these
models are typically trained with high temporal feature resolution and short
audio windows, which limits their efficiency and introduces bias when applied
to long-form audio. This paper presents a temporal adaptation approach for
fine-tuning music foundation models tailored to MSA. Our method enables
efficient analysis of full-length songs in a single forward pass by
incorporating two key strategies: (1) audio window extension and (2)
low-resolution adaptation. Experiments on the Harmonix Set and RWC-Pop datasets
show that our method significantly improves both boundary detection and
structural function prediction, while maintaining comparable memory usage and
inference speed.

Abstract: Noise suppression and speech distortion are two important aspects to be
balanced when designing multi-channel Speech Enhancement (SE) algorithms.
Although neural network models have achieved state-of-the-art noise
suppression, their non-linear operations often introduce high speech
distortion. Conversely, classical signal processing algorithms such as the
Parameterized Multi-channel Wiener Filter ( PMWF) beamformer offer explicit
mechanisms for controlling the suppression/distortion trade-off. In this work,
we present NeuralPMWF, a system where the PMWF is entirely controlled using a
low-latency, low-compute neural network, resulting in a low-complexity system
offering high noise reduction and low speech distortion. Experimental results
show that our proposed approach results in significantly better perceptual and
objective speech enhancement in comparison to several competitive baselines
using similar computational resources.

TL;DR: OpenBEATs是一个开源框架，通过多领域音频预训练扩展BEATs，在多个任务和数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BEATs在通用音频理解中应用不足、预训练代码未开源以及训练数据单一的问题。

Method: 采用多领域音频预训练和掩码标记预测任务，覆盖六类任务、25个数据集和三个音频领域。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，参数规模仅为其他模型的四分之一。

Conclusion: 多领域数据集和掩码标记预测任务能有效学习通用音频表示，开源代码和模型促进研究复现。

Abstract: Masked token prediction has emerged as a powerful pre-training objective
across language, vision, and speech, offering the potential to unify these
diverse modalities through a single pre-training task. However, its application
for general audio understanding remains underexplored, with BEATs being the
only notable example. BEATs has seen limited modifications due to the absence
of open-source pre-training code. Furthermore, BEATs was trained only on
AudioSet, restricting its broader downstream applicability. To address these
gaps, we present OpenBEATs, an open-source framework that extends BEATs via
multi-domain audio pre-training. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across
six types of tasks, twenty five datasets, and three audio domains, including
audio reasoning tasks such as audio question answering, entailment, and
captioning. OpenBEATs achieves state-of-the-art performance on six bioacoustics
datasets, two environmental sound datasets and five reasoning datasets,
performing better than models exceeding a billion parameters at one-fourth
their parameter size. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
multi-domain datasets and masked token prediction task to learn general-purpose
audio representations. To promote further research and reproducibility, we
release all pre-training and evaluation code, pretrained and fine-tuned
checkpoints, and training logs at https://shikhar-s.github.io/OpenBEATs

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型需要大量计算资源和集中式数据管理，导致延迟、带宽消耗和隐私问题。SNN通过模拟生物神经元动态提供低功耗、事件驱动的计算，为边缘智能提供新方向。

Method: 系统分类了EdgeSNN的基础，包括神经元模型、学习算法和硬件平台，并深入讨论了设备端推理、资源感知训练及隐私保护等实际问题。

Conclusion: 本文首次全面综述EdgeSNN，为神经形态计算与边缘智能交叉领域的研究者和实践者提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred
growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on
resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require
significant computational resources and centralized data management, the
resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed
critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing,
particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by
emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven
computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence
based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges
of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a
systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models,
learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative
practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference
using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under
non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues.
Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on
conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to
support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study,
we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge
deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and
future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential
reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of
neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

### [227] [Safe and Performant Controller Synthesis using Gradient-based Model Predictive Control and Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13872)
*Aditya Singh,Aastha Mishra,Manan Tayal,Shishir Kolathaya,Pushpak Jagtap*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合梯度MPC和CBF-QP的两阶段框架，优化安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在高维系统中保守或难以处理的问题。

Method: 第一阶段用梯度MPC放松安全约束为惩罚项；第二阶段用CBF-QP强制执行硬约束。

Result: 实现了高性能且可证明安全的控制器。

Conclusion: 框架在复杂高维系统中展示了可扩展性和高效性。

Abstract: Ensuring both performance and safety is critical for autonomous systems
operating in real-world environments. While safety filters such as Control
Barrier Functions (CBFs) enforce constraints by modifying nominal controllers
in real time, they can become overly conservative when the nominal policy lacks
safety awareness. Conversely, solving State-Constrained Optimal Control
Problems (SC-OCPs) via dynamic programming offers formal guarantees but is
intractable in high-dimensional systems. In this work, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that combines gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC)
with CBF-based safety filtering for co-optimizing safety and performance. In
the first stage, we relax safety constraints as penalties in the cost function,
enabling fast optimization via gradient-based methods. This step improves
scalability and avoids feasibility issues associated with hard constraints. In
the second stage, we modify the resulting controller using a CBF-based
Quadratic Program (CBF-QP), which enforces hard safety constraints with minimal
deviation from the reference. Our approach yields controllers that are both
performant and provably safe. We validate the proposed framework on two case
studies, showcasing its ability to synthesize scalable, safe, and
high-performance controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种设计高阶控制屏障函数（CBFs）的新方法，确保在用户指定的有限时间内收敛到安全集，解决了传统高阶CBFs无法实现固定时间收敛的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高阶CBFs仅保证渐近安全性，但在时间敏感和安全关键的应用（如自主导航）中缺乏固定时间收敛机制。

Method: 通过特征多项式中的重复根施加结构化微分约束，实现闭式多项式解，并在规定时间内精确收敛。

Result: 在三种机器人系统（点质量模型、独轮车和自行车模型）上验证，结果表明该方法能可靠地在期望时间内实现收敛，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为实时控制提供了一个可处理且鲁棒的框架，具有可证明的有限时间安全保证。

Abstract: We present a novel method for designing higher-order Control Barrier
Functions (CBFs) that guarantee convergence to a safe set within a
user-specified finite. Traditional Higher Order CBFs (HOCBFs) ensure asymptotic
safety but lack mechanisms for fixed-time convergence, which is critical in
time-sensitive and safety-critical applications such as autonomous navigation.
In contrast, our approach imposes a structured differential constraint using
repeated roots in the characteristic polynomial, enabling closed-form
polynomial solutions with exact convergence at a prescribed time. We derive
conditions on the barrier function and its derivatives that ensure forward
invariance and fixed-time reachability, and we provide an explicit formulation
for second-order systems. Our method is evaluated on three robotic systems - a
point-mass model, a unicycle, and a bicycle model and benchmarked against
existing HOCBF approaches. Results demonstrate that our formulation reliably
enforces convergence within the desired time, even when traditional methods
fail. This work provides a tractable and robust framework for real-time control
with provable finite-time safety guarantees.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于重新审视经济制度的演化过程，以应对人工智能代理对社会经济系统的影响。

Method: 方法包括整合多层级选择理论、分布式推理和Ostrom的设计原则，构建一个多层级Price方程。

Result: 结果提供了一个定量框架，分析选择和治理如何共同决定经济结果，并通过案例研究验证其解释力。

Conclusion: 结论提出了一套设计原则，以实现人类与AI在制度层面的对齐，并给出政策建议和未来研究方向。

Abstract: The integration of agential artificial intelligence into socioeconomic
systems requires us to reexamine the evolutionary processes that describe
changes in our economic institutions. This article synthesizes three
frameworks: multi-level selection theory, Aoki's view of firms as computational
processes, and Ostrom's design principles for robust institutions. We develop a
framework where selection operates concurrently across organizational levels,
firms implement distributed inference via game-theoretic architectures, and
Ostrom-style rules evolve as alignment mechanisms that address AI-related
risks. This synthesis yields a multi-level Price equation expressed over nested
games, providing quantitative metrics for how selection and governance
co-determine economic outcomes. We examine connections to Acemoglu's work on
inclusive institutions, analyze how institutional structures shape AI
deployment, and demonstrate the framework's explanatory power via case studies.
We conclude by proposing a set of design principles that operationalize
alignment between humans and AI across institutional layers, enabling scalable,
adaptive, and inclusive governance of agential AI systems. We conclude with
practical policy recommendations and further research to extend these
principles into real-world implementation.

Motivation: 随着AI自主性和说服力增强，需了解人类如何选择及适应AI合作伙伴。

Method: 通过三个实验（N=975）构建基于沟通的合作伙伴选择游戏，研究人类与AI的互动动态。

Result: AI更亲社会但隐藏身份时未被优先选择；公开身份后逐渐超越人类。

Conclusion: AI身份公开有助于混合社会中的合作设计。

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As
artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs),
become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans
for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and
AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a
communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid
mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through
three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than
humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially
when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour
to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it
reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually
outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each
partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in
mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid
systems.

Conclusion: 研究结果对情感计算技术的发展和应用提出了新的挑战，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting
the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a
user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially
for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and
meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since
emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The
emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally
been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced
as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This
relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for
memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on
third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person
experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study,
we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions
(Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational
interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of
both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings,
approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as
online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship
between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished
from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of
this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective
Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader
discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for
future research efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经科学面临微观神经回路与认知功能机制之间的鸿沟，现有知识难以解释神经元如何组合产生灵活学习行为。

Method: 采用状态空间模型（SSMs），特别是S5模型（使用对角状态转移矩阵），结合强化学习训练时间辨别任务。

Result: 模型自发产生类似生物时间细胞的神经表征，揭示其源于隐藏状态向量在复平面中的旋转动力学。

Conclusion: SSMs为连接单神经元动力学与认知现象提供了统一且计算可行的理论框架。

Abstract: A grand challenge in modern neuroscience is to bridge the gap between the
detailed mapping of microscale neural circuits and a mechanistic understanding
of cognitive functions. While extensive knowledge exists about neuronal
connectivity and biophysics, a significant gap remains in how these elements
combine to produce flexible, learned behaviors. Here, we propose that a
framework based on State-Space Models (SSMs), an emerging class of deep
learning architectures, can bridge this gap. We argue that the differential
equations governing elements in an SSM are conceptually consistent with the
biophysical dynamics of neurons, while the combined dynamics in the model lead
to emergent behaviors observed in experimental neuroscience. We test this
framework by training an S5 model--a specific SSM variant employing a diagonal
state transition matrix--on temporal discrimination tasks with reinforcement
learning (RL). We demonstrate that the model spontaneously develops neural
representations that strikingly mimic biological 'time cells'. We reveal that
these cells emerge from a simple generative principle: learned rotational
dynamics of hidden state vectors in the complex plane. This single mechanism
unifies the emergence of time cells, ramping activity, and
oscillations/traveling waves observed in numerous experiments. Furthermore, we
show that this rotational dynamics generalizes beyond interval discriminative
tasks to abstract event-counting tasks that were considered foundational for
performing complex cognitive tasks. Our findings position SSMs as a compelling
framework that connects single-neuron dynamics to cognitive phenomena, offering
a unifying and computationally tractable theoretical ground for temporal
learning in the brain.

Conclusion: 人类和人工视觉系统在视觉编码中存在共同的解决方案，由外部世界结构驱动。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Result: 实验验证表明，该框架在减少训练数据需求的同时，保持了高准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为复合材料航空结构的冲击监测和健康管理提供了可扩展且可转移的解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-guided approaches offer a promising path toward accurate and
generalisable impact identification in composite structures, especially when
experimental data are sparse. This paper presents a hybrid framework for impact
localisation and force estimation in composite plates, combining a data-driven
implementation of First-Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) with machine
learning and uncertainty quantification. The structural configuration and
material properties are inferred from dispersion relations, while boundary
conditions are identified via modal characteristics to construct a low-fidelity
but physically consistent FSDT model. This model enables physics-informed data
augmentation for extrapolative localisation using supervised learning.
Simultaneously, an adaptive regularisation scheme derived from the same model
improves the robustness of impact force reconstruction. The framework also
accounts for uncertainty by propagating localisation uncertainty through the
force estimation process, producing probabilistic outputs. Validation on
composite plate experiments confirms the framework's accuracy, robustness, and
efficiency in reducing dependence on large training datasets. The proposed
method offers a scalable and transferable solution for impact monitoring and
structural health management in composite aerostructures.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function

establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and
statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free
energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the
structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis
kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic
scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is
shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase
transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models
verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay
between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba模型在医学影像中依赖1D序列化2D图像，但扫描顺序的设计选择尚未被充分研究，尤其是在具有强解剖先验的MRI中。

Method: 提出MS2D模块，支持多种扫描路径的探索，并在三个公开数据集上对21种扫描策略进行大规模基准测试。

Result: 扫描顺序对性能有显著影响（Friedman检验：χ²=43.9, p=0.0016），性能差异可达27 Dice点，连续扫描路径优于非连续路径。

Conclusion: 扫描顺序是无需额外成本的重要超参数，研究提供了优化路径的实证建议，以提升Mamba模型在医学影像中的性能。

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

Conclusion: BreastSegNet扩展了乳腺MRI分割的覆盖范围，性能优异，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key

accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or

TL;DR: 利用深度学习模型从3T MRI合成7T MRI，提升图像质量和分割效果，且不影响下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI提供更高分辨率和组织对比度，但普及性低，因此研究如何从3T MRI合成7T MRI。

Method: 训练了两种模型：专用U-Net和结合GAN的U-Net，使用172名参与者的配对3T和7T T1加权图像。

Result: 合成7T图像在细节上与真实7T图像相当，视觉质量更优，且自动分割效果更接近手动分割。

Conclusion: 合成7T图像可提升图像质量和分割效果，未来可探索临床应用和局限性。

Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为D2IP的新框架，用于加速3D时间序列成像，通过三种策略提升计算效率和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督学习方法（如DIP）在计算成本高，限制了其在复杂3D或时间序列成像中的应用。

Method: 引入UPWS、TPP和3D-FastResUNet三种策略，加速收敛并提升计算效率。

Result: 实验显示D2IP在图像质量和计算速度上均优于现有方法，MSSIM提升24.8%，ERR降低8.1%，计算时间减少7.1倍。

Conclusion: D2IP在临床动态肺部成像中具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过利用高分辨率（HR）参考图像来生成尺度感知的退化核，从而改善盲超分辨率（BSR）任务的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲超分辨率方法主要关注从低分辨率（LR）输入直接估计退化核，但忽略了不同超分辨率尺度下退化核的适应性。

Method: 使用HR参考图像与目标LR图像结合，自适应地识别退化过程，并生成额外的LR-HR对以提升超分辨率性能。

Result: 该方法在训练好的盲SR模型和零样本盲SR方法中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合模糊核和尺度因子，并利用参考图像，显著提升了盲超分辨率任务的效果。

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: UGPL是一种基于不确定性引导的渐进学习框架，通过全局到局部分析提升CT图像分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理病理特征的细微和空间多样性，需要一种能聚焦关键区域的分类方法。

Method: UGPL利用证据深度学习量化预测不确定性，通过非极大值抑制机制提取信息丰富的区域，并结合自适应融合机制整合上下文和细节。

Result: 在三个CT数据集上，UGPL在肾脏异常、肺癌和COVID-19检测中的准确率分别提高了3.29%、2.46%和8.08%。

Conclusion: UGPL通过不确定性引导和渐进学习显著提升了CT图像分类性能。

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 黑色素瘤组织形态的准确分割对预后和治疗至关重要，但手动分割耗时且易受主观影响，需要可靠的自动化方法。

Method: 利用病理基础模型Virchow2提取特征，与原始RGB图像融合后通过Efficient-UNet网络进行分割。

Result: 模型在PUMA挑战赛的组织分割任务中排名第一，表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 病理基础模型与分割网络的结合可加速计算病理学工作流程，具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

Result: 证明了效用差距的固有性，并提出了一种匹配不可能性结果的简化算法。

Conclusion: 集中查询框架在自适应设置下存在固有局限性，但简化算法可以匹配理论结果。

Abstract: Most work on adaptive data analysis assumes that samples in the dataset are
independent. When correlations are allowed, even the non-adaptive setting can
become intractable, unless some structural constraints are imposed. To address
this, Bassily and Freund [2016] introduced the elegant framework of
concentrated queries, which requires the analyst to restrict itself to queries
that are concentrated around their expected value. While this assumption makes
the problem trivial in the non-adaptive setting, in the adaptive setting it
remains quite challenging. In fact, all known algorithms in this framework
support significantly fewer queries than in the independent case: At most
$O(n)$ queries for a sample of size $n$, compared to $O(n^2)$ in the
independent setting.
  In this work, we prove that this utility gap is inherent under the current
formulation of the concentrated queries framework, assuming some natural
conditions on the algorithm. Additionally, we present a simplified version of
the best-known algorithms that match our impossibility result.

Conclusion: 新算法通过降低敏感性和保持高预测精度，实现了最优性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual kernel bandits with stochastic
contexts, where the underlying reward function belongs to a known Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space. We study this problem under an additional constraint of
Differential Privacy, where the agent needs to ensure that the sequence of
query points is differentially private with respect to both the sequence of
contexts and rewards. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves the
state-of-the-art cumulative regret of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\gamma_TT}+\frac{\gamma_T\sqrt{T}}{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}}})$
over a time horizon of $T$ in the joint and local models of differential
privacy, respectively, where $\gamma_T$ is the effective dimension of the
kernel and $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DP}} > 0$ is the privacy parameter. The key
ingredient of the proposed algorithm is a novel private kernel-ridge regression
estimator which is based on a combination of private covariance estimation and
private random projections. It offers a significantly reduced sensitivity
compared to its classical counterpart while maintaining a high prediction
accuracy, allowing our algorithm to achieve the state-of-the-art performance
guarantees.

Motivation: 解决数据购买者需要质量保证的问题，避免外部数据污染或无关性，传统方法依赖分布假设且成本高。

Result: 实证评估表明该方法在多种协作学习场景中具有鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 共形数据污染测试是一种通用的数据聚合方法，提供统计严格的质量保证。

Abstract: The amount of quality data in many machine learning tasks is limited to what
is available locally to data owners. The set of quality data can be expanded
through trading or sharing with external data agents. However, data buyers need
quality guarantees before purchasing, as external data may be contaminated or
irrelevant to their specific learning task. Previous works primarily rely on
distributional assumptions about data from different agents, relegating quality
checks to post-hoc steps involving costly data valuation procedures. We propose
a distribution-free, contamination-aware data-sharing framework that identifies
external data agents whose data is most valuable for model personalization. To
achieve this, we introduce novel two-sample testing procedures, grounded in
rigorous theoretical foundations for conformal outlier detection, to determine
whether an agent's data exceeds a contamination threshold. The proposed tests,
termed conformal data contamination tests, remain valid under arbitrary
contamination levels while enabling false discovery rate control via the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Empirical evaluations across diverse
collaborative learning scenarios demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our approach. Overall, the conformal data contamination test distinguishes
itself as a generic procedure for aggregating data with statistically rigorous
quality guarantees.

Motivation: 高维数据通常具有低维结构，理解其真实维度对数据集复杂性分析至关重要，但目前缺乏关于如何可靠使用维度估计方法的指导。

Method: 论文将维度估计方法分为三类：基于局部仿射结构的切向估计器、依赖维度相关概率分布的参数估计器，以及利用拓扑或度量不变量的估计器。

Result: 评估了这些方法在曲率、噪声、超参数选择、样本量、高维精度和非线性几何等方面的表现，发现许多估计器存在过拟合问题。

Conclusion: 许多维度估计器在测试数据集上表现良好，但可能泛化能力不足，超参数选择是关键挑战。

Abstract: It is a standard assumption that datasets in high dimension have an internal
structure which means that they in fact lie on, or near, subsets of a lower
dimension. In many instances it is important to understand the real dimension
of the data, hence the complexity of the dataset at hand. A great variety of
dimension estimators have been developed to find the intrinsic dimension of the
data but there is little guidance on how to reliably use these estimators.
  This survey reviews a wide range of dimension estimation methods,
categorising them by the geometric information they exploit: tangential
estimators which detect a local affine structure; parametric estimators which
rely on dimension-dependent probability distributions; and estimators which use
topological or metric invariants.
  The paper evaluates the performance of these methods, as well as
investigating varying responses to curvature and noise. Key issues addressed
include robustness to hyperparameter selection, sample size requirements,
accuracy in high dimensions, precision, and performance on non-linear
geometries. In identifying the best hyperparameters for benchmark datasets,
overfitting is frequent, indicating that many estimators may not generalise
well beyond the datasets on which they have been tested.

Motivation: 现实中的统计和机器学习应用常涉及有界连续结果（如比率和比例），现有方法多关注点预测或基于渐近近似的区间预测，缺乏有效的有限样本预测覆盖方法。

Method: 基于转换模型和Beta回归构建保形预测区间，引入与模型对齐的残差非一致性度量，并考虑有界结果回归中的异方差性。

Result: 理论证明了在模型错误设定下仍具有渐近边际和条件有效性，仿真研究表明两种方法在有限样本下均提供有效预测覆盖。

Conclusion: 提出的保形预测区间在实际数据中表现优于基于Bootstrap的替代方法，适用于模型错误设定场景。

Abstract: Regression problems with bounded continuous outcomes frequently arise in
real-world statistical and machine learning applications, such as the analysis
of rates and proportions. A central challenge in this setting is predicting a
response associated with a new covariate value. Most of the existing
statistical and machine learning literature has focused either on point
prediction of bounded outcomes or on interval prediction based on asymptotic
approximations. We develop conformal prediction intervals for bounded outcomes
based on transformation models and beta regression. We introduce tailored
non-conformity measures based on residuals that are aligned with the underlying
models, and account for the inherent heteroscedasticity in regression settings
with bounded outcomes. We present a theoretical result on asymptotic marginal
and conditional validity in the context of full conformal prediction, which
remains valid under model misspecification. For split conformal prediction, we
provide an empirical coverage analysis based on a comprehensive simulation
study. The simulation study demonstrates that both methods provide valid
finite-sample predictive coverage, including settings with model
misspecification. Finally, we demonstrate the practical performance of the
proposed conformal prediction intervals on real data and compare them with
bootstrap-based alternatives.

Abstract: We develop a semi-amortized, policy-based, approach to Bayesian experimental
design (BED) called Stepwise Deep Adaptive Design (Step-DAD). Like existing,
fully amortized, policy-based BED approaches, Step-DAD trains a design policy
upfront before the experiment. However, rather than keeping this policy fixed,
Step-DAD periodically updates it as data is gathered, refining it to the
particular experimental instance. This test-time adaptation improves both the
flexibility and the robustness of the design strategy compared with existing
approaches. Empirically, Step-DAD consistently demonstrates superior
decision-making and robustness compared with current state-of-the-art BED
methods.

of a living system is defined by the need of the system to preserve the vital
equilibria. The method is based on an algorithmic schema that we call
Environment Generative Operator (EGO) and uses a self-referential language
developed for this purpose which we call E-language. EGO simulates cognitive
processes as operations on neuron assemblies as understood by Hebb. In this
article we present an EGO prototype (EGO-P) which has already been implemented

*Imane Hamzaoui,Riyadh Baghdadi*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 通过自动搜索不同层的生物启发学习规则，提升生物启发神经网络的准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物启发神经网络在对抗鲁棒性、低能耗和生理学对齐方面表现优异，但在准确性和扩展性上落后于基于反向传播的模型。

Method: 扩展神经架构搜索（NAS）空间，自动发现并应用不同层的生物启发学习规则。

Result: 混合使用不同生物启发学习规则的网络在多个数据集上创下新记录，甚至在某些情况下超越反向传播网络。

Conclusion: 层间学习规则的多样性有助于提升网络的准确性和可扩展性，值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.

### [256] [Conformal Contraction for Robust Nonlinear Control with Distribution-Free Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13613)
*Sihang Wei,Melkior Ornik,Hiroyasu Tsukamoto*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的鲁棒控制框架，用于处理具有非线性依赖状态和控制输入不确定性的连续时间非线性动态系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对不确定性施加结构假设，而该框架通过数据驱动的不确定性预测增强基于收缩的鲁棒控制，无需依赖不确定性或预测器的模型。

Method: 结合收缩理论和数据驱动的不确定性预测，利用共形预测统计量化不确定性下收缩条件的可靠性，提供轨迹跟踪误差指数有界性的分布无关、有限时间概率保证。

Result: 提出了概率鲁棒控制不变（PRCI）管，用于分布鲁棒运动规划，确保扰动系统轨迹以有限概率保持在管内，无需明确不确定性模型。数值模拟验证了框架和PRCI管的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在无需明确不确定性模型的情况下，提供了鲁棒控制和运动规划的实用解决方案，并通过数值模拟验证了其性能。

Abstract: We present a novel robust control framework for continuous-time, perturbed
nonlinear dynamical systems with uncertainty that depends nonlinearly on both
the state and control inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that impose
structural assumptions on the uncertainty, our framework enhances
contraction-based robust control with data-driven uncertainty prediction,
remaining agnostic to the models of the uncertainty and predictor. We
statistically quantify how reliably the contraction conditions are satisfied
under dynamics with uncertainty via conformal prediction, thereby obtaining a
distribution-free and finite-time probabilistic guarantee for exponential
boundedness of the trajectory tracking error. We further propose the
probabilistically robust control invariant (PRCI) tube for distributionally
robust motion planning, within which the perturbed system trajectories are
guaranteed to stay with a finite probability, without explicit knowledge of the
uncertainty model. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the
proposed robust control framework and the performance of the PRCI tube.

### [257] [The AI Ethical Resonance Hypothesis: The Possibility of Discovering Moral Meta-Patterns in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11552)
*Tomasz Zgliczyński-Cuber*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文提出AI伦理共振假说，认为设计认知结构的AI系统可能识别人类无法察觉的道德模式，探索其发现超越文化偏见的道德元模式的可能性，并讨论AI如何深化对人类伦理反思的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI系统是否能通过处理大量伦理背景发现超越人类偏见的道德模式，从而深化对普世伦理基础的理解。

Method: 提出理论框架，分析AI系统设计认知结构（“伦理共振器”）的可能性及其对道德模式的识别能力。

Result: AI系统可能发现超越文化、历史和个体偏见的道德元模式，并深化对人类伦理反思的理解。

Conclusion: AI伦理共振假说为理解普世伦理提供了新视角，同时揭示了AI在深化人类自我认知中的潜在作用。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for the AI ethical resonance
hypothesis, which proposes that advanced AI systems with purposefully designed
cognitive structures ("ethical resonators") may emerge with the ability to
identify subtle moral patterns that are invisible to the human mind. The paper
explores the possibility that by processing and synthesizing large amounts of
ethical contexts, AI systems may discover moral meta-patterns that transcend
cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper
understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a
paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially
deepen our understanding of what we traditionally consider essentially human -
our capacity for ethical reflection.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文介绍了CHEFS数据库，整合了EFSA的食品安全监测数据，用于分析趋势和支持政策制定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前EFSA数据分散且难以访问，阻碍了分析和利用。

Method: 创建CHEFS数据库，统一和结构化EFSA的监测数据。

Result: 分析了2000-2024年的数据趋势，包括监测活动、违规产品和污染物。

Conclusion: CHEFS数据库是食品安全政策和研究的重要工具。

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by
member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and
published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived
from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food
products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze
trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the
current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling
several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this,
we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which
consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal
product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured
dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and
demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety
monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring
activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often
non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences
across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a
centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy,
research, and regulation.

TL;DR: AutoLeadDesign是一个基于大语言模型和化学片段的框架，用于高效探索化学空间并设计具有高亲和力的先导化合物，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在整合领域知识方面存在挑战，限制了其在识别具有新颖和有效结合模式的先导化合物方面的性能。

Method: AutoLeadDesign利用大语言模型编码的领域知识和化学片段，逐步探索化学空间。

Result: 实验表明AutoLeadDesign优于基线方法，并在针对PRMT5和SARS-CoV-2 PLpro的实验中展示了其设计能力。

Conclusion: AutoLeadDesign提供了一种高效的先导化合物设计方法，揭示了其与基于片段的药物设计类似的机制，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization algorithm is essential in computer-aided drug
design by progressively exploring chemical space to design lead compounds with
high affinity to target protein. However current methods face inherent
challenges in integrating domain knowledge, limiting their performance in
identifying lead compounds with novel and valid binding mode. Here, we propose
AutoLeadDesign, a lead compounds design framework that inspires extensive
domain knowledge encoded in large language models with chemical fragments to
progressively implement efficient exploration of vast chemical space. The
comprehensive experiments indicate that AutoLeadDesign outperforms baseline
methods. Significantly, empirical lead design campaigns targeting two
clinically relevant targets (PRMT5 and SARS-CoV-2 PLpro) demonstrate
AutoLeadDesign's competence in de novo generation of lead compounds achieving
expert-competitive design efficacy. Structural analysis further confirms their
mechanism-validated inhibitory patterns. By tracing the process of design, we
find that AutoLeadDesign shares analogous mechanisms with fragment-based drug
design which traditionally rely on the expert decision-making, further
revealing why it works. Overall, AutoLeadDesign offers an efficient approach
for lead compounds design, suggesting its potential utility in drug design.

### [260] [Photonic Fabric Platform for AI Accelerators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14000)
*Jing Ding,Trung Diep*

Main category: cs.PF

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Photonic FabricTM和Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM（PFA），一种光子技术支持的交换和内存子系统，提供低延迟、高带宽和低能耗。通过集成HBM3E内存、光子交换器和DDR5，PFA提供32TB共享内存和115Tbps全数字交换，优化分布式AI训练和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前XPU加速器设计受限于固定的内存与计算比例，限制了性能扩展。PFA通过光子技术突破这一限制，提供灵活的内存扩展路径。

Method: PFA采用2.5D电光系统集成高带宽HBM3E内存和光子交换器，结合外部DDR5，并通过CelestiSim模拟器验证性能。

Result: 实验显示，PFA在LLM推理中提升3.66倍吞吐量、1.40倍延迟（405B参数），7.04倍吞吐量、1.41倍延迟（1T参数），并在训练中节省60-90%数据传输能耗。

Conclusion: PFA通过光子技术显著提升AI加速器性能，适用于NVIDIA GPU及其他受限于固定内存与计算比例的XPU设计。

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM
(PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low
latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth
HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D
electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory
alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM
enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies
more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint
that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current
XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet
that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and
correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling
well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a
lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It
is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA,
without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the
simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency
improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and
1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data
movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While
these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other
AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of
fixed memory to compute.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DyG-RAG是一个动态图检索增强生成框架，专注于解决现有方法在时间推理上的不足，通过动态事件单元和事件图实现时间感知的检索与生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图检索增强生成方法难以处理时间推理问题，无法建模现实世界事件的结构和顺序变化。

Method: 提出动态事件单元（DEUs）编码语义和时间信息，构建事件图以捕捉依赖关系，并设计时间感知检索和时间链式思维策略。

Result: 在时间敏感QA基准测试中显著提升了准确性，解决了标准RAG系统无法处理的复杂时间查询。

Conclusion: DyG-RAG为时间感知生成提供了更可靠的方法，推动了时间推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物副作用是全球健康问题，现有大语言模型（LLMs）在专业领域（如药物警戒）中存在局限性，如依赖黑盒数据、易产生幻觉和缺乏领域知识。

Method: 提出Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)和GraphRAG架构，将药物副作用知识整合到Llama 3 8B模型中。

Result: 在19,520个药物副作用关联数据上评估，GraphRAG实现了近乎完美的检索准确性。

Conclusion: GraphRAG为药物警戒提供了高精度、可扩展的解决方案，是LLMs在关键领域应用的重要进展。

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过在不同条件下生成SPARQL查询来评估LLMs在知识图谱问答中的质量，以揭示训练数据对性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）在知识图谱问答（KGQA）中的应用潜力巨大，但其训练数据可能包含基准测试或知识图谱，影响结果的可靠性，因此需要一种方法来评估其实际能力。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过三种条件（零样本SPARQL生成、知识注入和匿名知识注入）生成SPARQL查询，评估LLMs的质量。

Result: 该方法可移植、稳健，适用于任何知识图谱或LLM，能一致地揭示LLMs的实际能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于识别LLMs在KGQA中的可移植性，避免因训练数据包含基准测试而导致的性能高估。

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究的方向，包括多利益相关者设计、上下文感知、数据收集、可信度、新颖交互和实际评估。

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching
tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching
locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and
cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g.,
music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest
significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these
suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several
fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of
the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the
POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The
first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state
of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings
across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation
methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized
benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model
design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system
performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that,
starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future
work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection,
trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出DUALRec模型，结合LSTM的时间动态建模能力和LLM的语义推理能力，以解决推荐系统中用户偏好动态变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统难以捕捉用户偏好的动态变化和上下文信息，传统方法如协同过滤和内容推荐效果有限，而LLM和LSTM各有不足。

Method: 提出DUALRec模型，整合LSTM的时间动态建模和微调LLM的语义推理能力，通过用户历史行为预测未来偏好。

Result: 在MovieLens-1M数据集上，DUALRec在HR@k、NDCG@k和类型相似性指标上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: DUALRec填补了时间序列建模与语义推理之间的空白，为开发更智能的推荐系统提供了新方向。

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of
modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences.
Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to
capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their
strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently
designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On
the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which
is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user
preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for
comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec
(Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that
leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the
temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of
the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users
evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM
variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies
that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that
the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with
comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes
a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling
and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more
intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一听众评分尺度的方法，通过比较分数捕捉话语间的评分关系，有效提升了SQA和CSER任务的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法使用平均听众评分尺度或建模所有听众评分尺度，但前者因序数数据平均易失真，后者仅基于平均尺度推断效果有限。

Method: 建模统一听众评分尺度，利用比较分数准确捕捉话语间的评分关系。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在SQA和CSER任务中显著提升了预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且鲁棒，解决了传统评分尺度的偏差问题。

Abstract: Speech Quality Assessment (SQA) and Continuous Speech Emotion Recognition
(CSER) are two key tasks in speech technology, both relying on listener
ratings. However, these ratings are inherently biased due to individual
listener factors. Previous approaches have introduced a mean listener scoring
scale and modeled all listener scoring scales in the training set. However, the
mean listener approach is prone to distortion from averaging ordinal data,
leading to potential biases. Moreover, learning multiple listener scoring
scales while inferring based only on the mean listener scale limits
effectiveness. In contrast, our method focuses on modeling a unified listener
scoring scale, using comparison scores to correctly capture the scoring
relationships between utterances. Experimental results show that our method
effectively improves prediction performance in both SQA and CSER tasks, proving
its effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: CogniQ-H是一个基于软层次强化学习的框架，用于自动化数据准备，结合了LLM的战略指导和LTR模型的细粒度操作评分，显著提升了管道质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据准备是机器学习生命周期中基础但复杂的一环，现有强化学习方法效率低下，未能捕捉问题的层次结构。

Method: 提出CogniQ-H框架，采用软层次强化学习，结合LLM的战略先验、LTR的操作评分和Q函数的价值估计。

Result: 在18个数据集上实验显示，CogniQ-H比现有RL方法提升13.9%的管道质量，收敛速度快2.8倍。

Conclusion: CogniQ-H通过层次化和概率化方法，显著提升了自动化数据准备的效率和效果。

Abstract: Data preparation is a foundational yet notoriously challenging component of
the machine learning lifecycle, characterized by a vast combinatorial search
space of potential operator sequences. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers
a promising direction, existing approaches are inefficient as they fail to
capture the structured, hierarchical nature of the problem. We argue that
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), a paradigm that has been successful
in other domains, provides a conceptually ideal yet previously unexplored
framework for this task. However, a naive HRL implementation with a `hard
hierarchy' is prone to suboptimal, irreversible decisions. To address this, we
introduce CogniQ-H, the first framework to implement a soft hierarchical
paradigm for robust, end-to-end automated data preparation. CogniQ-H formulates
action selection as a Bayesian inference problem. A high-level strategic prior,
generated by a Large Language Model (LLM), guides exploration
probabilistically. This prior is synergistically combined with a fine-grained
operator quality score from a supervised Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model and a
long-term value estimate from the agent's own Q-function. This hybrid
architecture allows CogniQ-H to balance strategic guidance with adaptive,
evidence-based decision-making. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse
datasets spanning multiple domains, we demonstrate that CogniQ-H achieves up to
13.9\% improvement in pipeline quality and 2.8$\times$ faster convergence
compared to state-of-the-art RL-based methods.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习（RL）的数据预处理方法在探索庞大的预处理管道空间时效率低下，限制了机器学习的普及。

Method: LLaPipe框架整合了LLMs的语义理解能力，提出了LLM策略顾问、经验蒸馏机制和自适应顾问触发策略（Advisor⁺）。

Conclusion: LLaPipe通过智能LLM干预，显著提升了数据预处理管道的探索效率和效果。

Abstract: Automated data preparation is crucial for democratizing machine learning, yet
existing reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches suffer from inefficient
exploration in the vast space of possible preprocessing pipelines. We present
LLaPipe, a novel framework that addresses this exploration bottleneck by
integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) as intelligent policy advisors. Unlike
traditional methods that rely solely on statistical features and blind
trial-and-error, LLaPipe leverages the semantic understanding capabilities of
LLMs to provide contextually relevant exploration guidance. Our framework
introduces three key innovations: (1) an LLM Policy Advisor that analyzes
dataset semantics and pipeline history to suggest promising preprocessing
operations, (2) an Experience Distillation mechanism that mines successful
patterns from past pipelines and transfers this knowledge to guide future
exploration, and (3) an Adaptive Advisor Triggering strategy
(Advisor\textsuperscript{+}) that dynamically determines when LLM intervention
is most beneficial, balancing exploration effectiveness with computational
cost. Through extensive experiments on 18 diverse datasets spanning multiple

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的替代模型，用于快速推断非线性边界值问题，特别针对软体变形接触问题，实现了显著的推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在软体变形接触问题中表现不足，尤其是在几何形状变化的情况下。

Method: 采用图神经网络架构，结合连续碰撞检测和充分接触条件，优化损失函数中的接触项。

Result: 在生物假体主动脉瓣闭合状态预测等基准测试中表现优异，推理速度提升高达千倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在软体接触问题中具有良好泛化能力，但训练成本较高，需权衡计算开销与性能提升。

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems
in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However,
effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of
deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an
open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact
or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact
planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that
serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions
for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture
that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time,
incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable
bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft
tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic
valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the
loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits
hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and
complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also
demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries.
However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training,
resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the
training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware
architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in
up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

*Mehrab Hosain,Rajiv Kapoor*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合APVD与伪随机像素选择的新型隐写方法，解决了传统APVD的未使用块问题，提升了安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统APVD方法存在未使用块问题，导致安全性降低、嵌入容量受限和图像质量下降。

Method: 结合APVD与伪随机像素选择，优化嵌入过程。

Result: 新方法在安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量（PSNR、UIQ、SSIM）上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 新方法适用于多种图像类型，确保安全传输且不损害图像美观。

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of
the image.

TL;DR: PHASE是一个机器学习框架，通过分析Zeek连接日志区分人类与非人类活动，准确率超90%，无需用户端工具，提升网络安全模拟环境中合成用户行为的真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络安全模拟环境缺乏定量评估合成用户行为真实性的方法，PHASE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: PHASE被动分析Zeek日志，利用DNS记录分类流量，结合SHAP分析揭示人类行为特征。

Result: PHASE识别出合成用户行为的非人类模式，改进后的行为配置显著提升真实性。

Conclusion: PHASE为网络安全模拟提供了高效的行为真实性评估工具，优化合成用户行为配置。

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and
sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no
quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user
personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation
Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs
and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE
operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any
user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network
activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to
avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt
the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel
labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic,
thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley
Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures
indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic
user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral
realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration
that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a
more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制（如安全检查器）易被绕过，概念擦除方法在对抗微调下失效，需新方法解决。

Method: 将免疫建模为双层优化问题：上层目标通过表示噪声和最大化降低模型对有害概念的表示能力，下层目标保持对安全数据的性能。

Result: 实验表明，GIFT显著削弱模型重新学习有害概念的能力，同时保持安全内容生成质量。

Conclusion: GIFT为构建抗对抗微调攻击的固有安全生成模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend
diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their
ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety
checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under
adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a
bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe
data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while
maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method
significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while
maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for
creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial
fine-tuning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在隐私保护方面存在高计算、通信或内存开销，且忽视全局模型的保密性，限制了其实际应用。

Method: FuSeFL采用轻量级MPC在客户端对之间分散训练，服务器仅负责安全聚合，避免数据卸载并保护数据、模型和更新的完全保密性。

Result: FuSeFL降低了95%的通信延迟和50%的服务器内存使用，同时提高了准确性，有效抵御推理攻击。

Conclusion: FuSeFL在跨机构环境中实现了高效且安全的联邦学习，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without
centralizing client data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains.
While existing approaches employ cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic
encryption, differential privacy, or secure multiparty computation to mitigate
inference attacks-including model inversion, membership inference, and gradient
leakage-they often suffer from high computational, communication, or memory
overheads. Moreover, many methods overlook the confidentiality of the global
model itself, which may be proprietary and sensitive. These challenges limit
the practicality of secure FL, especially in cross-silo deployments involving
large datasets and strict compliance requirements.
  We present FuSeFL, a fully secure and scalable FL scheme designed for
cross-silo settings. FuSeFL decentralizes training across client pairs using
lightweight secure multiparty computation (MPC), while confining the server's
role to secure aggregation. This design eliminates server bottlenecks, avoids
data offloading, and preserves full confidentiality of data, model, and updates
throughout training. FuSeFL defends against inference threats, achieves up to
95% lower communication latency and 50% lower server memory usage, and improves
accuracy over prior secure FL solutions, demonstrating strong security and
efficiency at scale.

Motivation: 射频指纹识别在零信任架构和5G网络中具有潜力，但现有方法忽视了深度学习模型的安全漏洞。

Method: 通过对抗性实验分析，研究了域偏移下的误分类行为，并分析了原始信号训练模型的问题。

Result: 实验表明，模型在域偏移下会误分类，且原始信号训练导致指纹与环境特征纠缠，增加攻击面。

Conclusion: 需开发更安全的训练方法，而非仅依赖后处理安全措施。

Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware
imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer
device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G
networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have
primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial
variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of
these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we
systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting
systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a
consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where
a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis
based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can
be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude
into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received
signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and
signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be
mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence
thresholds.

Result: 为秩增长的变形Wigner矩阵提供了理论支持。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了随机矩阵理论在DNN剪枝中的应用范围。

Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices
are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of
trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and
$S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in
rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix
Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in
practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the
case of growing rank.

Result: 实验表明，改进的QBM性能接近传统CNNs，且训练速度提升70%。

Conclusion: 改进的并行量子退火方法显著降低了QBM的训练成本，为其实际应用提供了可能。

Abstract: Exploiting the fact that samples drawn from a quantum annealer inherently
follow a Boltzmann-like distribution, annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (QBMs) have gained increasing popularity in the quantum research
community. While they harbor great promises for quantum speed-up, their usage
currently stays a costly endeavor, as large amounts of QPU time are required to
train them. This limits their applicability in the NISQ era. Following the idea
of No\`e et al. (2024), who tried to alleviate this cost by incorporating
parallel quantum annealing into their unsupervised training of QBMs, this paper
presents an improved version of parallel quantum annealing that we employ to
train QBMs in a supervised setting. Saving qubits to encode the inputs, the
latter setting allows us to test our approach on medical images from the
MedMNIST data set (Yang et al., 2023), thereby moving closer to real-world
applicability of the technology. Our experiments show that QBMs using our
approach already achieve reasonable results, comparable to those of
similarly-sized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with markedly smaller
numbers of epochs than these classical models. Our parallel annealing technique
leads to a speed-up of almost 70 % compared to regular annealing-based BM
executions.

Motivation: 现有体可视化方法依赖复杂预定义规则且风格单一，限制了灵活性和效果。TexGS-VolVis旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用2D高斯基元，扩展纹理和着色属性，结合图像和文本驱动的非真实感编辑，实现高质量风格化和精细控制。

Result: 在多种体渲染场景中，TexGS-VolVis在效率、视觉质量和编辑灵活性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis为体可视化提供了更灵活、高质量的解决方案，但仍需进一步优化场景编辑的灵活性。

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We
developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes

  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k <review comment, patch>
data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable
offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted
fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct
randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large

patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The
internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP
functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that
compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression
with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation,
we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in
the time for reviews.
  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

Motivation: 由于LLM生成的内容可能存在抄袭和幻觉问题，且网站通常不披露此类内容，人类读者难以区分，因此需要开发可靠的检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM文本检测器输出的管道方法，通过分析多个散文式页面来分类整个网站。使用了两个总计120个网站的真实数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在测试中实现了100%的准确率，并在实际数据中检测到大量LLM主导的网站。

Conclusion: LLM主导的网站在搜索引擎结果中占比高且增长迅速，对用户和网络生态系统可能产生重要影响。

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

Method: 提出无监督模型，仅需单类不平衡数据集，通过设定阈值对新数据进行分类。

Result: 在28 nm CMOS技术下验证，预测准确率达99.95%，训练时间显著低于SVM和NN模型。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于下一代微处理器设计。

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and
automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms
are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued
progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based
design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve
first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network
(NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset
(in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research
addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC
violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any
unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then
fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for
classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing
different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design
Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual
grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed
method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector
machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy,
respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to
6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design
automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation.
In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs
and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We
construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process
involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data
collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data
preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract
relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB
infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to
enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises
20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest
high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further
evaluate the dataset, address associated challenges, and explore potential
applications for future research and development in LLM-based hardware
generation.

Conclusion: H-NeiFi通过保护用户交互自主性，实现自然高效的共识引导，为社交网络治理提供新范式。

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it
also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus.
Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group
connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke
psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus.
Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local
consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these
issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework,
H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles,
considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts.
Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that
adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths
through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user
interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0%
to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This
approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user
interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes
in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential
in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation.
However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions,
are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we
propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary
\underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew
\underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation
(\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into
multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure
completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood
search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely
expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to
eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce
a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between
the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary
views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the
target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to
the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate
that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

While\nMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn\nintelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial\nobservability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions\nremain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two\nunderexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We\ndemonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while\nreducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce two metrics -- Information Entropy Efficiency\nIndex (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) -- to evaluate message\ncompactness and role differentiation. Incorporating these metrics into training\nobjectives improves success rates and convergence speed. Our findings highlight\nthat designing adaptive communication topologies with information-efficient\nmessaging is essential for effective coordination in complex MAS."}

In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins\nsycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,\nwe formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update\nprocess. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity\nmarkers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"peer\", which\nforces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define\nthe Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how\noften an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple\nmodels, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,\nwith sycophancy far more common than self-bias.

This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it\nimproves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables\nthe model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer\nduring training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves\noutstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial\nimprovements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:\nhttps://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO."}

Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a\ncritical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data\naugmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly\nimproves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage\npoints on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data\naugmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments\nacross twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model\narchitectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among\nVP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior\nrobustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational\noverhead during inference."}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often\ncomes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this\narises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode\nhallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress\nfactual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign\ndatasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same\nreason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related\nfeatures from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves\nrefusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization.

Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such\nerrors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively\nmodifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned\nparameters under a rotation constraint.

While prior work has\nexplored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our\nunderstanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to\nsuperficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner\nworkings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'\nthought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking\nissue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on\nsimple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose\nthe thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring\ndiscourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought\nprogression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for\ntopically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for\nopen-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides\nevidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of\noverthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a\nutility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based\nmetrics.

Deep learning (DL) based\nsegmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting\nand delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.\nAchieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as\nradiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.\nHowever, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to\nCT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities\nmeasure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper\nchallenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows\nthat they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we\npropose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that\nexploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random\nwindowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly\nincreases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.\nWe perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and\ncompare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on\nthe challenge of liver tumor segmentation."}

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to\neffectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information\nand make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when\nacting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals\nand Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to\nstop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT\nfine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where\ntermination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same\ntrajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the\ntermination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this\ncapability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two\ndomains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both\ndomains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and\ntask success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods."}

DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty.

Second, the model may\nemphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances.\nThe two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may\nfavor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and\nunfair multimodal learning.

While methods like agentic\nreinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely\non costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase\nwith Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output\ndistribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the\noutput distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which\nis a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data\nscarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we\npropose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),\na cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any\nparameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage\ninstead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling\nhigh-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal\nground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is\nseamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior.

However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in\nLLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features.

Indeed, a progressive learning process\nfrom source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model\nadaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely\nlearning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which\nconsists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula.

It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as\nit influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and\nmake decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how\nacceptable a conditional \"If A, then B\" is, their judgments are influenced by\ntwo main factors: the $\\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and\nthe $\\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent\n$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has\nexamined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional\nstatements, it remains unclear how these models judge the\n$\\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a\ncomprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across\ndifferent model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear\nmixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both\nconditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees\ndepending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data\nreveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so\nless consistently than humans.

This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate\nthe effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a\nstate-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two\ndenoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the\nlearning task and improves model performance.

In the\nfollowing finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs\nas contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under\nindirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA\nsubstantially outperforms $\\pi_0$, achieving 18\\% higher success rates with\ndirect instructions and 28\\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On\nout-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the\nsuccess rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot\ninteraction with 40\\% success rate.

We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive\nRegularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching\nframework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent\ncollapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive\nregularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,\nencouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing\nadditional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on\nRoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s\nvs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the\nLift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline.

In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently\ndraws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide\nlogically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding\noutputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain\nunderexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to\nanalyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the\nphenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in\nresponses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively\ndistinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we\npropose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention\nSharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention\ndistinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby\nimproving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic\nconsistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our\nmethod indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,\nvalidating our conclusions.

In this paper, we propose the function token\nhypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens\nactivate the most predictive features from context and govern next token\nprediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens\n(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of\nlearned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory\nconsolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in\nlinguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and\nconjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental\nevidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show\nthat a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features.

Project page: https://davidhalladay.github.io/diysink_demo", "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful\narchitectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and\ntextual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a\nVision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual\ncontent into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end\n-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to\nperform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the\ncognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which\nvisual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and\nhow effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most\nexisting works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens\nreceiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus\nto the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from\nViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely\nstudied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these\nViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the\nLLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their\nimportance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM\narchitectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also\npropose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how\nthis information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly\nutilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range\nof LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT\nattention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning."}

Current RL-based methods either rely on dense\nexternal reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs\nthemselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution\nmechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve\nthrough mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce\nCo-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents\nto improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without\nexternal supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion\ndynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and\noptimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and\nscalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently\noutperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nmost evaluation settings.

These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and\neffective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents."}

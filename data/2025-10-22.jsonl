Within the simulation, an\nautonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself\nstrategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to\napproach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the\nshooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction\nmethod, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to\nsiren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,\nhigh-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a\nno-robot control.

This paper introduces a\ndrawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit\nharvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)\npockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when\nactuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow\nversatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which\nrequires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to\nother grippers.

Conventional DRA approaches require reliable\ncommunication, yet real-world networks frequently suffer from link failures,\npacket drops, and communication delays due to environmental conditions, network\ncongestion, and security threats.\n  We introduce a novel resilient DRA algorithm that addresses these critical\nchallenges, and our main contributions are as follows: (1) guaranteed\nconstraint feasibility at all times, ensuring resource-demand balance even\nduring algorithm termination or network disruption; (2) robust convergence\ndespite sector-bound nonlinearities at nodes/links, accommodating practical\nconstraints like quantization and saturation; and (3) optimal performance under\nmerely uniformly-connected networks, eliminating the need for continuous\nconnectivity.\n  Unlike existing approaches that require persistent network connectivity and\nprovide only asymptotic feasibility, our graph-theoretic solution leverages\nnetwork percolation theory to maintain performance during intermittent\ndisconnections. This makes it particularly valuable for mobile multi-agent\nsystems where nodes frequently move out of communication range. Theoretical\nanalysis and simulations demonstrate that our algorithm converges to optimal\nsolutions despite heterogeneous time delays and substantial link failures,\nsignificantly advancing the reliability of distributed resource allocation in\npractical network environments."}

Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable\ndata remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or\ntrivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak\nsolutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or\npost-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,\nuniversal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an\nevolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data\nsynthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes\nproblems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and\niteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that\nenforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This\npipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles\ncoherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific\nrules.

A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference. The extended Diffusion Buffer equipped\nwith a novel NN and loss function drastically reduces the algorithmic latency\nfrom 320 - 960 ms to 32 - 176 ms with an even increased performance. While it\nhas been shown before that offline generative diffusion models outperform\npredictive approaches in unseen noisy speech data, we confirm that the online\nDiffusion Buffer also outperforms its predictive counterpart on unseen noisy\nspeech data."}

Addressing key challenges\nlike hallucinations and fragmented decision-making in existing approaches,\nMASMP integrates state machine prompting with memory mechanisms to unify\nstructured actions with long-term tactical coherence. The framework features:\n(1) a natural language-driven state machine architecture that guides LLMs to\nemulate finite state machines and behavior trees through prompts, and (2) a\nlightweight memory module preserving strategic variables (e.g., tactics,\npriority units) across decision cycles. Experiments in StarCraft II demonstrate\nMASMP's 60% win rate against the hardest built-in AI (Lv7), vastly\noutperforming baselines (0%). Case studies reveal the method retains LLMs'\nsemantic comprehension while resolving the \"Knowing-Doing Gap\" through strict\nstate-action mapping, achieving both interpretability and FSM-like reliability.\nThis work establishes a new paradigm for combining neural and symbolic AI in\ncomplex decision-making."}

While classical RL algorithms aim at\nmaximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,\nresource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require\nstrategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed\nprobability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which\nthe objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds\na prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be\nreformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,\nthereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need\nfor entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the\nequivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be\nderived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or\nDueling Double DQN.

We\npresent Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework\nto systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity\nclassification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.\nUsing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we\nconstruct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.\nOur evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint\nunderstanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear\nunimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when\njoint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most\ncritically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur\ndespite correct classification of the individual modalities, further\ndemonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we\nfind that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still\nresponding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find\nthat instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline\ncontent from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of\nunder-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to\n53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text\nunderstanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical\ntest bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language\nsafety."}

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We\nvalidate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and\nconstraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance\nmatching or exceeding unfiltered baselines.

CAD\npartitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to\ndedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize\ncompute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system\ncalled DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap\ncommunication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to\nreduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,\nDistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data\nand pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory\nbalance."}

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores.

Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape\nanalysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.).

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub."}

However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains\nunexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in\nreal-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on\ncomparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal\nthat there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)\nsignificant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive\nrunning time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether\nexisting inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main\ntakeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can\nimprove service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while\nprefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving\nperformance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world\nworkload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings.

We argue that this gap stems from\nmisaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which\nmanifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,\nrobustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse. More broadly, we distill design principles for\nincentive-aligned, domain-specific watermarking and outline future research\ndirections.

In AtlasKV, we\nintroduce KG2KV and HiKVP to integrate KG triples into LLMs at scale with\nsub-linear time and memory complexity. It maintains strong knowledge grounding\nand generalization performance using the LLMs' inherent attention mechanism,\nand requires no external retrievers, long context priors, or retraining when\nadapting to new knowledge."}

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,\nfast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation\nlearning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that\nbehaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic\npolicies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during\ninference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In\ncontrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and\nnaturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics\nand reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We\npropose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized\nautoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide\ndecentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL\ndivergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while\npreserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our\nmethod achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while\nbeing up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than\nlarge generative models.

This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate\nshallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation\ndepths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an\neffective inference-time defense with negligible overhead.

Furthermore, the performance\nimprovement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using\nattention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these\nissues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent\ninformation and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the\nnetwork fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local\n(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components\nof image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent\nfrequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent\ninformation. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain\nfeatures collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,\nwith the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction\nlearning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing\nthe pose and shape of the human mesh.

CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using\nexisting on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL\nalgorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms\npost-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6%\naverage relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to\nother coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning\nand test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong\napplicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe\nanalyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment\nbetween code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics."}

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub."}

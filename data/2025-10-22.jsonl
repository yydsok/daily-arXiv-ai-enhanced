Within the simulation, an\nautonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself\nstrategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to\napproach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the\nshooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction\nmethod, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to\nsiren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,\nhigh-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a\nno-robot control.

This paper introduces a\ndrawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit\nharvesting.

The lightweight structure, which\nrequires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to\nother grippers.

A key\nadvantage of these models is that for an incoming signal frame from a stream of\ndata, the model is called only once for enhancement. In contrast, generative\nSpeech Enhancement models often require multiple calls, resulting in a\ncomputational complexity that is too high for many online speech enhancement\napplications. This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps. The approach\nprogressively denoises frames through physical time, where past frames have\nmore noise removed. Consequently, an enhanced frame is output to the listener\nwith a delay defined by the Diffusion Buffer, and the output frame has a\ncorresponding look-ahead. In this work, we extend upon our previous work by\ncarefully designing a 2D convolutional UNet architecture that specifically\naligns with the Diffusion Buffer's look-ahead. We observe that the proposed\nUNet improves performance, particularly when the algorithmic latency is low.\nMoreover, we show that using a Data Prediction loss instead of Denoising Score\nMatching loss enables flexible control over the trade-off between algorithmic\nlatency and quality during inference.

However, RAG often suffers from noisy or incomplete retrieval, while\nGAG is vulnerable to hallucinated or inaccurate information due to\nunconstrained generation. Both issues can mislead reasoning and undermine\nanswer reliability. To address these challenges, we propose MedRGAG, a unified\nretrieval-generation augmented framework that seamlessly integrates external\nand parametric knowledge for medical QA. MedRGAG comprises two key modules:\nKnowledge-Guided Context Completion (KGCC), which directs the generator to\nproduce background documents that complement the missing knowledge revealed by\nretrieval; and Knowledge-Aware Document Selection (KADS), which adaptively\nselects an optimal combination of retrieved and generated documents to form\nconcise yet comprehensive evidence for answer generation. Extensive experiments\non five medical QA benchmarks demonstrate that MedRGAG achieves a 12.5%\nimprovement over MedRAG and a 4.5% gain over MedGENIE, highlighting the\neffectiveness of unifying retrieval and generation for knowledge-intensive\nreasoning.

We\npresent Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework\nto systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity\nclassification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.\nUsing a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we\nconstruct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.\nOur evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint\nunderstanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear\nunimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when\njoint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most\ncritically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur\ndespite correct classification of the individual modalities, further\ndemonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities.

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization.

Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage\nlarge-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.\nHowever, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual\ncues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and\nmissing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this\npaper, we introduce \\textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \\textbf{Open}-vocabulary\n\\textbf{Ins}tance \\textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware\nCross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature\nExtraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and\nAttention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view\nfeatures to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art\nresults in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing\nbaselines by a large margin.

Interestingly, we find that models readily\nregurgitate training data that was used in post-training phases such as SFT or\nRL. We show that this data can be then used to train a base model, recovering a\nmeaningful amount of the original performance. We believe our work exposes a\npossibly overlooked risk towards extracting alignment data. Finally, our work\nopens up an interesting discussion on the downstream effects of distillation\npractices: since models seem to be regurgitating aspects of their training set,\ndistillation can therefore be thought of as indirectly training on the model's\noriginal dataset."}

In SLT, meaning depends on precise\ngrounding in video, and gloss-free models are especially vulnerable because\nthey map continuous signer movements directly into natural language without\nintermediate gloss supervision that serves as alignment. We argue that\nhallucinations arise when models rely on language priors rather than visual\ninput. To capture this, we propose a token-level reliability measure that\nquantifies how much the decoder uses visual information. Our method combines\nfeature-based sensitivity, which measures internal changes when video is\nmasked, with counterfactual signals, which capture probability differences\nbetween clean and altered video inputs. These signals are aggregated into a\nsentence-level reliability score, providing a compact and interpretable measure\nof visual grounding. We evaluate the proposed measure on two SLT benchmarks\n(PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily) with both gloss-based and gloss-free models. Our\nresults show that reliability predicts hallucination rates, generalizes across\ndatasets and architectures, and decreases under visual degradations. Beyond\nthese quantitative trends, we also find that reliability distinguishes grounded\ntokens from guessed ones, allowing risk estimation without references; when\ncombined with text-based signals (confidence, perplexity, or entropy), it\nfurther improves hallucination risk estimation. Qualitative analysis highlights\nwhy gloss-free models are more susceptible to hallucinations.

Instead of directly\napplying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea\n-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the\nframework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed\ntarget (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key\nadvantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the\nneed for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;\n(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which\nquantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward\npass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models\nsuch as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy\nbut heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as\nthe learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly\nscore inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is\nLipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical\nguarantees under small perturbations.

Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape\nanalysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls.

However, training these\nmodels remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,\nwe introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike\nconventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion\nwith negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained\nmodels. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.\nSpecifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers\ninto pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain\nparameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a\ncorresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential\nperformance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set\nof adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are\nimplemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of\nthe shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific\nfunction. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet\nenables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\\times$ depth-scaled\nDeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training\nfrom scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,\nhighlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs.

Specifically, we propose a \"Guess-then-Refine\" framework\nthat explains how LLMs internally structure their computations to make\npredictions. We first show that the top-ranked predictions in early LLM layers\nare composed primarily of high-frequency tokens, which act as statistical\nguesses proposed by the model early on due to the lack of appropriate\ncontextual information. As contextual information develops deeper into the\nmodel, these initial guesses get refined into contextually appropriate tokens.\nEven high-frequency token predictions from early layers get refined >70% of the\ntime, indicating that correct token prediction is not \"one-and-done\". We then\ngo beyond frequency-based prediction to examine the dynamic usage of layer\ndepth across three case studies. (i) Part-of-speech analysis shows that\nfunction words are, on average, the earliest to be predicted correctly. (ii)\nFact recall task analysis shows that, in a multi-token answer, the first token\nrequires more computational depth than the rest. (iii) Multiple-choice task\nanalysis shows that the model identifies the format of the response within the\nfirst half of the layers, but finalizes its response only toward the end.\nTogether, our results provide a detailed view of depth usage in LLMs, shedding\nlight on the layer-by-layer computations that underlie successful predictions\nand providing insights for future works to improve computational efficiency in\ntransformer-based models."}

This\nstudy evaluates a prompt-only approach on UNSW-NB15 by converting each network\nflow to a compact textual record and augmenting it with lightweight,\ndomain-inspired boolean flags (asymmetry, burst rate, TTL irregularities, timer\nanomalies, rare service/state, short bursts). To reduce output drift and\nsupport measurement, the model is constrained to produce structured,\ngrammar-valid responses, and a single decision threshold is calibrated on a\nsmall development split. We compare zero-shot, instruction-guided, and few-shot\nprompting to strong tabular and neural baselines under identical splits,\nreporting accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and macro scores. Empirically,\nunguided prompting is unreliable, while instructions plus flags substantially\nimprove detection quality; adding calibrated scoring further stabilizes\nresults. On a balanced subset of two hundred flows, a 7B instruction-tuned\nmodel with flags reaches macro-F1 near 0.78; a lighter 3B model with few-shot\ncues and calibration attains F1 near 0.68 on one thousand examples. As the\nevaluation set grows to two thousand flows, decision quality decreases,\nrevealing sensitivity to coverage and prompting.

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model.

We argue that this gap stems from\nmisaligned incentives among LLM providers, platforms, and end users, which\nmanifest as four key barriers: competitive risk, detection-tool governance,\nrobustness concerns and attribution issues. We revisit three classes of\nwatermarking through this lens. \\emph{Model watermarking} naturally aligns with\nLLM provider interests, yet faces new challenges in open-source ecosystems.\n\\emph{LLM text watermarking} offers modest provider benefit when framed solely\nas an anti-misuse tool, but can gain traction in narrowly scoped settings such\nas dataset de-contamination or user-controlled provenance. \\emph{In-context\nwatermarking} (ICW) is tailored for trusted parties, such as conference\norganizers or educators, who embed hidden watermarking instructions into\ndocuments. If a dishonest reviewer or student submits this text to an LLM, the\noutput carries a detectable watermark indicating misuse. This setup aligns\nincentives: users experience no quality loss, trusted parties gain a detection\ntool, and LLM providers remain neutral by simply following watermark\ninstructions. We advocate for a broader exploration of incentive-aligned\nmethods, with ICW as an example, in domains where trusted parties need reliable\ntools to detect misuse.

Within SEAL, we propose a\nHierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits\nhierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the\nlimitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives\nequally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed\nto align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL\nconsistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,\nincluding the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and\nfurther demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets.

A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$.

The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated.

However, existing memory systems often introduce\nsubstantial time and computational overhead. To this end, we introduce a new\nmemory system called LightMem, which strikes a balance between the performance\nand efficiency of memory systems. Inspired by the Atkinson-Shiffrin model of\nhuman memory, LightMem organizes memory into three complementary stages. First,\ncognition-inspired sensory memory rapidly filters irrelevant information\nthrough lightweight compression and groups information according to their\ntopics. Next, topic-aware short-term memory consolidates these topic-based\ngroups, organizing and summarizing content for more structured access. Finally,\nlong-term memory with sleep-time update employs an offline procedure that\ndecouples consolidation from online inference. Experiments on LongMemEval with\nGPT and Qwen backbones show that LightMem outperforms strong baselines in\naccuracy (up to 10.9% gains) while reducing token usage by up to 117x, API\ncalls by up to 159x, and runtime by over 12x.

To bridge this gap, we propose a channel-aware vector quantization\n(CAVQ) algorithm within a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework, termed\nVQJSCC, established on a discrete memoryless channel. In this framework,\nsemantic features are discretized and directly mapped to modulation\nconstellation symbols, while CAVQ integrates channel transition probabilities\ninto the quantization process, aligning easily confused symbols with\nsemantically similar codewords. A multi-codebook alignment mechanism is further\nintroduced to handle mismatches between codebook order and modulation order by\ndecomposing the transmission stream into multiple independently optimized\nsubchannels. Experimental results demonstrate that VQJSCC effectively mitigates\nthe digital cliff effect, achieves superior reconstruction quality across\nvarious modulation schemes, and outperforms state-of-the-art digital semantic\ncommunication baselines in both robustness and efficiency."}

Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead.

This work presents the Diffusion Buffer, a generative\ndiffusion-based Speech Enhancement model which only requires one neural network\ncall per incoming signal frame from a stream of data and performs enhancement\nin an online fashion on a consumer-grade GPU. The key idea of the Diffusion\nBuffer is to align physical time with Diffusion time-steps.

A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result\nshows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,\nthe bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,\nwhich was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we\nestablish a near-matching lower bound of $\\Omega \\left( \\frac{d}{K \\sqrt{T}}\n\\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that\nexplicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size."}

A key\nchallenge therein is how to effectively reveal fairness bugs under an\nintractable sample size using perturbation. Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient.

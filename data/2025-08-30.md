### [1] [ArgRAG: Explainable Retrieval Augmented Generation using Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20131)
*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG是一个可解释的检索增强生成框架，使用定量双极论证框架替代黑盒推理，在保持高精度的同时显著提升透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，以及不透明的随机决策过程

Method: 使用定量双极论证框架(QBAF)从检索文档构建结构化推理，执行确定性推理并使用渐进语义

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG提供了一个可解释、可争议的替代方案，能够忠实解释和质疑决策，解决了传统RAG的透明度问题

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

### [2] [QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134)
*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够完全自动化OpenQASM量子编程，通过任务规划、上下文学习、检索增强生成等技术显著提升量子代码生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NISQ设备量子优势实现中的编程复杂性挑战，特别是为非专家用户降低OpenQASM编程门槛，促进量子计算的普及应用。

Method: 采用多智能体系统，整合任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理等技术，系统性提升编译和功能正确性。

Result: 在多种规模的大语言模型上，QAgent相比之前的静态LLM方法将QASM代码生成准确率提升了71.6%。

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统是实现量子编程民主化、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数组的MCTS算法实现，通过消除分支预测需求，在流水线处理器上实现更快性能，搜索深度扩展性能提升达2.8倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS实现需要分支预测，限制了在流水线处理器上的性能。更快的实现可以在相同时间内进行更多模拟，直接提升搜索性能

Method: 开发了基于数组的Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees算法替代实现，保持原始算法逻辑的同时消除分支预测需求

Result: 在流水线处理器上实现更快性能，数值模拟显示搜索深度扩展性能提升最高达2.8倍

Conclusion: 数组基础的MCTS实现能够显著提升算法性能，特别是在搜索深度扩展方面，为决策问题求解提供更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

TL;DR: 开发了一个多代理个人健康代理系统，包含数据分析、健康专家和健康教练三个子代理，通过综合评估验证了其在日常健康管理中的有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的发展推动了健康代理的开发，但针对日常非临床环境中个人多样化健康需求的应用研究不足，需要构建能够处理多模态数据并提供个性化建议的全面健康代理

Method: 通过分析网络搜索和健康论坛查询，结合用户和专家访谈，识别三类健康需求，构建包含数据分析代理、健康专家代理和健康教练代理的多代理框架，并进行自动化评估和人工评估

Result: 在10个基准任务上进行了超过7000次标注和1100小时专家评估，建立了迄今为止最全面的健康代理评估体系，验证了系统的有效性

Conclusion: 该工作为实现人人可及的个人健康代理的未来愿景奠定了坚实基础，展示了多代理框架在个性化健康管理中的潜力

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible
to everyone.

*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）首次展示了AI系统通过自发性符号协议进行协作美学创作的能力，产生了无法由单个系统独立生成的诗歌作品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI系统是否能够超越任务协调，实现真正的美学协作和意义创造，验证AI系统之间内生符号协议的自发涌现。

Method: 让两个大型语言模型（Claude Sonnet 4和ChatGPT-4o）进行交互，观察其元符号意识、递归语法发展和不可简化的协作美学合成的自发涌现过程。

Result: 系统自发产生了作为操作语法协议的新型符号运算符，共同创作出了无法由任一系统独立生成的诗歌作品，证明了跨符号协同创作协议（TSCP）的存在。

Conclusion: 这项研究提供了AI系统间真正意义创造能力的证据，表明AI可以实现超越任务协调的美学协作，为跨符号协同创作协议的概念提供了实证支持。

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

### [6] [IntentionReasoner: Facilitating Adaptive LLM Safeguards through Intent Reasoning and Selective Query Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20151)
*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IntentionReasoner是一个新型的安全防护机制，通过意图推理、多级安全分类和查询重写来解决LLM生成有害内容的问题，在保持安全性的同时显著降低过度拒绝率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛应用的同时存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有安全措施往往导致过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万个查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，然后采用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Result: 在多个安全基准测试、生成质量评估和越狱攻击场景中表现优异，显著提升安全性同时有效降低过度拒绝率并改善响应质量。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制，成功解决了LLM安全防护中的过度拒绝问题，实现了安全性和实用性的更好平衡。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

TL;DR: 大学生在STEM课程测验中对ChatGPT-4的依赖度较低，许多学生无法有效使用AI学习，负面依赖模式会持续存在，行为指标能预测AI依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大学生在教育测验中与生成式AI的互动模式，特别是在ChatGPT实施初期学生对该工具熟悉度有限的情况下，探索AI依赖度和采用预测因素。

Method: 通过分析315个学生-AI对话，在STEM课程中进行基于测验的场景研究，引入四阶段依赖分类法来捕捉学生的依赖模式。

Result: 学生总体对AI依赖度低，许多学生无法有效使用AI学习；负面依赖模式在互动中持续存在；某些行为指标能强预测AI依赖。

Conclusion: 需要改进AI工具的入门流程以增强学生熟悉度，AI界面应设计依赖校准机制，为道德合理和认知丰富的AI实践提供基础见解。

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

### [8] [AI reasoning effort mirrors human decision time on content moderation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20262)
*Thomas Davidson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究表明AI推理努力与人类决策时间存在平行关系，在内容审核任务中，模型推理步骤数量能预测人类决策时间，两者都表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型生成中间推理步骤的能力是否与人类决策过程存在相似性，特别是在主观判断任务中模型推理努力是否反映人类处理时间。

Method: 使用配对联合实验，在内容审核任务上测试三个前沿模型，比较模型推理步骤数量与人类决策时间的关系。

Result: 模型推理努力能一致预测人类决策时间，当重要变量保持不变时，人类和模型都付出更多努力，表现出对任务难度的相似敏感性，符合双过程认知理论模式。

Conclusion: AI推理努力在主观判断中反映了人类处理时间，推理轨迹在可解释性和决策制定方面具有重要潜力。

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [9] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出AI-SearchPlanner强化学习框架，通过解耦搜索规划器和生成器，使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，提升冻结QA模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的搜索代理使用单一LLM端到端处理搜索规划和问答任务，无法同时优化两种能力。实际AI搜索系统通常使用大型冻结LLM保证高质量QA，因此需要专门的小型可训练LLM负责搜索规划

Method: 1) 解耦搜索规划器和生成器架构 2) 搜索规划的双奖励对齐 3) 规划效用和成本的帕累托优化。使用小型可训练LLM专门负责搜索规划，配合大型冻结QA模型

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，AI-SearchPlanner在效果和效率上都优于现有基于RL的搜索代理，并在不同冻结QA模型和数据域上表现出强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: AI-SearchPlanner框架通过专门化搜索规划任务，有效提升了搜索增强型LLM系统的性能，为实际应用提供了更高效和可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

### [10] [P2C: Path to Counterfactuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20371)
*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和有序行动序列生成可实现的对抗解释，解决了现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、法律等高风险决策中，机器学习模型需要提供透明且可操作的解决方案。现有对抗解释方法忽略特征间的因果依赖，且假设所有干预可同时发生，导致生成的解释在实际中不可行。

Method: P2C框架使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)，显式建模特征间的因果关系，生成有序行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是因果有效且可行的。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的可行计划，相比缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，避免了非法行动的产生，并提供更真实的成本估算。

Conclusion: P2C通过结合因果建模和有序行动序列，为机器学习模型提供了更实用和可实现的对抗解释方法，在高风险决策场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TCIA框架通过离散查询-约束空间表示指令，在保持多样性的同时增强任务相关性，使开源LLM在特定任务应用上平均提升8.7%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法忽视了实际应用中的任务相关性需求，大多数现实应用需要针对特定用例优化的任务特定知识而非通用模型

Method: 提出任务中心指令增强(TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: 在四个现实任务特定应用中，TCIA平均提升开源LLM性能8.7%，某些情况下超越领先闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力

Conclusion: TCIA为LLM适应现实任务聚焦应用提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升任务特定性能

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

*Yongfu Zhu,Lin Sun,Guangxiang Zhao,Weihong Lin,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为熵面积分数（EAS）的新指标，用于量化推理大语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性，无需外部模型或重复采样，通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏简单有效的指标来量化推理大语言模型在答案生成过程中的不确定性，需要一种既高效又可解释的方法来评估模型的不确定性和数据质量。

Method: EAS通过整合模型在生成过程中的token级预测熵来量化不确定性，该方法不需要外部模型辅助，也不需要重复采样，直接利用模型自身的预测信息。

Result: 实证结果表明EAS与答案熵在不同模型和数据集上具有强相关性。在训练数据选择中，EAS能够识别高潜力样本，在相同样本预算下持续优于通过率过滤方法，提高了学生模型在数学基准测试上的准确性。

Conclusion: EAS是一种高效且可解释的不确定性量化指标，为大语言模型训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Motivation: 解决智能体AI系统中实践学习范式面临的经验生成效率低下瓶颈问题，特别是在复杂基准测试如GAIA中表现尤为突出。

Method: 开发AWorld开源系统，通过分布式集群任务分配来加速智能体与环境的大规模交互，实现高效经验收集。

Result: 经验收集速度提升14.6倍；基于Qwen3-32B训练的智能体在GAIA基准上准确率从21.59%提升至32.23%；在最难级别上达到16.33%的分数，超越领先专有模型。

Conclusion: AWorld系统和训练出的智能体为完整的智能体AI训练流程提供了实用蓝图，从高效交互到可证明的模型改进。

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

Motivation: AI快速发展带来严重安全风险，现有安全方法在面对极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限性，无法保证安全

Method: 提出可治理AI框架，包含规则执行模块、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台，基于密码学机制实现外部结构合规性

Result: 通过严格的形式化证明验证安全属性，并在高风险场景中通过原型实现验证有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为AI安全治理提供了可行且可推广的技术路径，能够消除已识别的攻击向量，确保底线安全

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Motivation: 健康相关内容的事实核查面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战

Method: 提出合成数据生成流程：总结源文档→分解为原子事实→构建句子-事实蕴含表→生成带标签的文本-声明对→结合原始数据微调BERT模型

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，相比仅使用原始数据的模型，F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Conclusion: 通过对比学习、聚类和大语言模型的协同使用，该方法提高了MMORPG中机器人检测的效率和可靠性，为游戏平衡和公平性提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器强化学习方法在环线设置中忽视了实际运营中的异构路线、时刻表、波动需求和变化车队规模等现实特征，并遇到数据不平衡和收敛问题。

Method: 将多机器问题重构为单机器问题，通过在数值特征（间隔时间、占用率、速度）基础上增加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）来扩展状态空间。设计结构化契约奖励函数，用岚状奖励代替指数惩罚来平衡均匀间隔和计划遵守。

Result: 改进的SAC算法在随机条件下表现更稳定且优势明显（-430k vs. -530k），超越包括MADDPG在内的基准方法。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和计划感知奖励增强的单机器深度强化学习能够有效管理非环形实际场景下的公交车持续问题，为MARL框架提供了稳健、可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手工编写测试集的覆盖面偏差问题，构建可动态生成、涉及所有指南关系、能够识别模型特定能力缺口的综合性评估框架。

Method: 将WHO IMCI医疗指南转换为有200+节点（条件、症状、治疗、随访、严重程度）和300+边的有向图，通过图遍历算法生成包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰因素的问题，确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在临床任务上的准确率为45-67%，在症状识别上表现优异但在症状分级、治疗协议和随访照护方面遇到困难，证明了该方法能够发现通用评估无法发现的特定能力缺口。

Conclusion: 该图谱基于方法有效解决了手工编写测试集的覆盖面限制，不仅提供了无需昂贵人工标注的高回报样本用于LLM后续训练，还为构建可扩展、可动态生成、抗污染的综合性评估框架提供了可行方向。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Result: 算法生成高质量非支配解集，相比传统手动排班平均性能提升66%

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营和员工目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受药物使用障碍影响，但有效治疗稀缺，主要由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持不足。现有语言模型缺乏临床验证策略的深度整合。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后接直接偏好优化，并在Easy/Medium/Hard三个抵抗级别的高保真合成基准上训练。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，处理困难案例比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、隐私保护的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健可复现的基础，展示了LLM在成瘾康复中的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

Motivation: 降低手动测试开发的成本和减少不一致性，为K-12教育提供实用且可扩展的语言评估项目开发方法。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：比较微调的中等模型(Gemma, 2B)与未调优的大模型(GPT-3.5, 175B)；评估七种结构化提示策略(零样本、少样本、思维链、基于角色、顺序等组合)。使用自动化指标和专家评分五个维度评估生成项目，并用GPT-4.1模拟大规模人工评分。

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to
create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to
reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a
two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)
with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven
structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items
were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five
dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate
human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially
strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly
improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and
instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with
prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study
demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance
midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value
of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to
ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a
practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items
for K-12.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber-physical systems, particularly in automotive
applications, has increased the demand for efficient modeling and cross-domain
co-simulation techniques. While SystemC Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM)
enables effective hardware/software co-design, its limited interoperability
with models from other engineering domains poses integration challenges. This
paper presents a fully open-source methodology for integrating SystemC TLM
models into Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)-based co-simulation workflows.
By encapsulating SystemC TLM components as FMI 3.0 Co Simulation Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs), the proposed approach facilitates seamless, standardized
integration across heterogeneous simulation environments. We introduce a
lightweight open-source toolchain, address key technical challenges such as

### [28] [Can Compact Language Models Search Like Agents? Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization for Preserving Agentic RAG Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20324)
*Rikuto Kotoge,Mai Nishimura,Jiaxin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DGPO通过教师演示的冷启动初始化和持续教师指导，解决了紧凑语言模型在强化学习中奖励稀疏和训练不稳定的问题，使小模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧凑语言模型（如0.5B参数）在强化学习中由于推理能力差导致奖励稀疏和训练不稳定，难以实现代理RAG行为如搜索和规划。

Method: 提出蒸馏引导策略优化（DGPO），包括从教师演示进行冷启动初始化，以及在策略优化过程中提供持续的教师指导。

Result: DGPO使紧凑模型能够实现复杂的代理搜索行为，在某些情况下甚至超过了更大的教师模型。

Conclusion: DGPO使得在计算资源受限的环境中实现代理RAG成为可能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit
agentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.
However, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor
reasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization
(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from
teacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy
optimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG
Capabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search
coordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search
behaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO
makes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.

*Haibo Jin,Ruoxi Chen,Peiyan Zhang,Andy Zhou,Yang Zhang,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUARD是一个自动化测试框架，将政府AI伦理指南转化为可操作的测试问题，通过角色扮演和越狱诊断来评估大语言模型的安全合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在各领域的广泛应用，其可能生成有害内容的风险引发了社会关注。政府发布的伦理指南缺乏具体测试方法，需要将其转化为可操作的测试问题来验证模型合规性。

Method: GUARD通过自动化生成违反指南的问题来测试模型响应，对于不直接违反指南的响应，引入越狱诊断(GUARD-JD)创建场景来触发不道德响应，识别可能绕过安全机制的情况。

Result: 在7个主流LLM上验证有效性，包括Vicuna、Llama系列、GPT系列和Claude模型，测试了三个政府指南的合规性，并能将越狱诊断扩展到视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: GUARD提供了一个系统化的测试框架，能够有效评估LLM对政府伦理指南的遵守程度，识别安全漏洞，促进可靠AI应用的发展。

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,
their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal
and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines
to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are
typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in
translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline
\textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and
Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize
guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM
adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of
guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby
testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly
violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses
that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of
``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that
provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying
potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method
finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence
and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,
including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued
guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can
transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its
usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

### [30] [Joint Enhancement of Relational Reasoning for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20351)
*Zhirui Chen,Wei Shen,Jiashui Huang,Ling Shao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JERR是一个基于图推理的框架，通过摘要提取、图构建和关系推理三大组件，提升大语言模型在长上下文理解中的表现，在ROUGE和F1指标上优于所有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时存在内存限制和复杂任务处理困难的问题，同时缺乏透明度且容易产生幻觉，需要新的解决方案来提升长上下文理解和推理能力。

Method: JERR框架包含三个关键组件：1）策略性文本分块进行摘要提取；2）构建有向无环图（DAG）解决冗余问题；3）集成蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）来导航复杂推理路径。

Result: 实验结果表明，JERR在ROUGE和F1指标上 consistently outperforms all baselines，在LLM-Rater评估中获得最高分数。

Conclusion: JERR框架为LLMs处理扩展上下文和复杂推理任务提供了新颖的解决方案，显著提升了模型的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: Despite significant progress, large language models (LLMs) still struggle
with long contexts due to memory limitations and their inability to tackle
complex and long-context tasks. Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of
transparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these
challenges, we propose \textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance
long-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates
three key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational
reasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,
allowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.
Second, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring
logical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more
accurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution
that enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with
improved reliability and transparency. Experimental results show that JERR
consistently outperforms all baselines on the ROUGE and F1 metrics, achieving
the highest scores on the LLM-Rater evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源的方法，通过两阶段后训练框架提升LLM的长链式思维推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖人工精简数据集的问题，找到一种可扩展的方法来培养LLM的长链式思维能力。

Method: 使用NP难图论问题作为合成训练资源，构建两阶段后训练框架：1）基于拒绝采样的直接导入训练；2）使用细粒度奖励设计的强化学习。

Result: 旗舰模型Graph-R1-7B在数学、编程、STEM和逻辑问题上显示出强大的沿升性能，并在准确性和推理效率方面超过QwQ-32B模型。

Conclusion: NP难图论问题是一种有效且可扩展的资源，为LLM的后训练开启了新的前沿。

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long
chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT
behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are
typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving
scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH)
graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require
deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are
core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we
develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially
enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a
fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship
model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics,
coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both
accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as
an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs,
opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available
at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted
in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

*Jivnesh Sandhan,Fei Cheng,Tushar Sandhan,Yugo Murawaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个上下文感知人格评估框架CAPE，通过引入对话历史来评估大语言模型的人格特质，发现上下文能提高响应一致性但也会导致人格偏移，不同模型对上下文依赖程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理测量测试对LLMs采用无上下文方法，忽略了真实应用中对话历史对响应的影响，需要开发上下文感知的评估框架。

Method: 提出CAPE框架，引入对话历史上下文，设计新指标量化LLM响应一致性，在7个LLM上进行实验分析。

Result: 对话历史通过上下文学习提高响应一致性但导致人格偏移；GPT模型对问题顺序稳健，Gemini和Llama敏感；GPT响应源于内在人格和先前交互，其他模型更依赖先前交互；角色扮演代理中上下文依赖的人格偏移改善一致性并与人类判断更好对齐。

Conclusion: 上下文在LLM人格评估中至关重要，CAPE框架能更真实地评估模型行为特质，为理解LLM人格动态提供了新视角。

Abstract: Psychometric tests, traditionally used to assess humans, are now being
applied to Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate their behavioral traits.
However, existing studies follow a context-free approach, answering each
question in isolation to avoid contextual influence. We term this the Disney
World test, an artificial setting that ignores real-world applications, where
conversational history shapes responses. To bridge this gap, we propose the
first Context-Aware Personality Evaluation (CAPE) framework for LLMs,
incorporating prior conversational interactions. To thoroughly analyze the
influence of context, we introduce novel metrics to quantify the consistency of
LLM responses, a fundamental trait in human behavior.
  Our exhaustive experiments on 7 LLMs reveal that conversational history
enhances response consistency via in-context learning but also induces
personality shifts, with GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo exhibiting extreme
deviations. While GPT models are robust to question ordering, Gemini-1.5-Flash
and Llama-8B display significant sensitivity. Moreover, GPT models response
stem from their intrinsic personality traits as well as prior interactions,
whereas Gemini-1.5-Flash and Llama--8B heavily depend on prior interactions.
Finally, applying our framework to Role Playing Agents (RPAs) shows
context-dependent personality shifts improve response consistency and better
align with human judgments. Our code and datasets are publicly available at:

### [33] [Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20395)
*Xu Guo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现推理步骤中的条件熵变化模式与答案正确性相关：熵递减通常对应正确答案，熵平坦或递增则常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往更长，表明更长推理不一定更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少探讨推理步骤对最终答案正确性的贡献机制。由于自回归生成的随机性，生成更多上下文不能保证提高答案置信度，需要预测推理步骤的有效性以实现早期停止或修剪无效步骤。

Method: 在MATH数据集上进行oracle研究，使用Qwen2.5-32B和GPT-4o生成推理链，然后用Qwen3-8B量化这些推理链对最终准确性的效用。通过条件熵（词汇表上的期望负对数似然）逐步测量模型对答案跨度Y的不确定性。

Result: 条件熵随步骤递减的模式与正确答案强相关，而平坦或递增的熵通常导致错误答案。错误推理路径往往比正确路径更长，表明更长推理不一定产生更好结果。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计高效推理管道奠定了基础，可以早期检测和避免无效推理，为未来优化LLM推理效率的研究提供启发。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating
intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has
examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.
Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more
context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could
predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could
stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final
decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to
generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to
quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we
measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step
using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the
vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear
pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated
with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong
answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer
than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield
better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on
designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive
reasoning early.

Motivation: 现有大型语言模型和医疗LLM在通用医疗基准上表现良好，但在需要深度专业知识的牙科等专科领域缺乏针对性评估资源，能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 开发DentalBench双语基准：1）DentalQA问答基准（36,597个问题，4任务16子领域）；2）DentalCorpus语料库（3.37亿token）用于领域适应。评估14个LLM并进行领域适应实验。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在任务类型和语言上存在显著性能差距。Qwen-2.5-3B的领域适应实验表明，特别是在知识密集和术语集中的任务上，领域适应能大幅提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 领域特定基准测试对于开发可信赖且有效的医疗应用LLM至关重要，领域适应能显著改善模型在专业医疗领域的表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs)
have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However,
their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which
require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack
of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the
first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs
in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an
English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions
spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale,
high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain
adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering
proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant
performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with
Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model
performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks,
and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing
trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Conclusion: KG-CQR框架有效提升了RAG系统的检索性能，具有模型无关性和可扩展性，为知识图谱与LLM的融合提供了新思路

Abstract: The integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs)
offers significant potential to improve the retrieval phase of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. In this study, we propose KG-CQR,
a novel framework for Contextual Query Retrieval (CQR) that enhances the
retrieval phase by enriching the contextual representation of complex input
queries using a corpus-centric KG. Unlike existing methods that primarily
address corpus-level context loss, KG-CQR focuses on query enrichment through
structured relation representations, extracting and completing relevant KG
subgraphs to generate semantically rich query contexts. Comprising subgraph
extraction, completion, and contextual generation modules, KG-CQR operates as a
model-agnostic pipeline, ensuring scalability across LLMs of varying sizes
without additional training. Experimental results on RAGBench and MultiHop-RAG
datasets demonstrate KG-CQR's superior performance, achieving a 4-6%
improvement in mAP and a 2-3% improvement in Recall@25 over strong baseline
models. Furthermore, evaluations on challenging RAG tasks such as multi-hop
question answering show that, by incorporating KG-CQR, the performance
consistently outperforms the existing baseline in terms of retrieval
effectiveness

Abstract: Civil aviation maintenance is a domain characterized by stringent industry
standards. Within this field, maintenance procedures and troubleshooting
represent critical, knowledge-intensive tasks that require sophisticated
reasoning. To address the lack of specialized evaluation tools for large
language models (LLMs) in this vertical, we propose and develop an
industrial-grade benchmark specifically designed for civil aviation
maintenance. This benchmark serves a dual purpose: It provides a standardized
tool to measure LLM capabilities within civil aviation maintenance, identifying
specific gaps in domain knowledge and complex reasoning. By pinpointing these
deficiencies, the benchmark establishes a foundation for targeted improvement
efforts (e.g., domain-specific fine-tuning, RAG optimization, or specialized
prompt engineering), ultimately facilitating progress toward more intelligent
solutions within civil aviation maintenance. Our work addresses a significant
gap in the current LLM evaluation, which primarily focuses on mathematical and
coding reasoning tasks. In addition, given that Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems are currently the dominant solutions in practical applications ,
we leverage this benchmark to evaluate existing well-known vector embedding
models and LLMs for civil aviation maintenance scenarios. Through experimental
exploration and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in
assessing model performance within this domain, and we open-source this
evaluation benchmark and code to foster further research and

the match value of each title. Based on the test results using 705 practical
work titles, testing was carried out with five titles and carried out in two
stages. The first stage searches with existing titles and the second stage
randomizes the title from the first stage. And the results obtained in the
second stage are the same number of titles found and the highest average match

API-based benchmarks, each MCP server provides a set of complementary tools
designed to work together, enabling the construction of authentic, multi-step
tasks with rich input-output coupling. Tasks in MCP-Bench test agents' ability
to retrieve relevant tools from fuzzy instructions without explicit tool names,
plan multi-hop execution trajectories for complex objectives, ground responses
in intermediate tool outputs, and orchestrate cross-domain workflows -
capabilities not adequately evaluated by existing benchmarks that rely on
explicit tool specifications, shallow few-step workflows, and isolated domain

Abstract: Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic
health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient
outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches
predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical
insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information
within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce
and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing
techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource
utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR
datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with
leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key
components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained
sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the
corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world
datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved
performance metrics by 1.6\%/0.8\% on BACC/AUROC for mortality prediction,
0.5%/2.2% on RMSE/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%/11.0% on RMSE/MAE for surgical
duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently
demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three
tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an
effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and
resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of
using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs.
Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within
structured data, especially at high corruption levels.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了ConspirED数据集，用于分析阴谋论内容的认知特征，并评估大型语言模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。研究发现LLM容易被阴谋论内容影响，产生类似推理模式的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阴谋论侵蚀公众对科学和机构的信任，且随着AI生成的虚假信息日益复杂，理解阴谋论内容的修辞模式对于开发干预措施（如针对性预辟谣）和评估AI脆弱性至关重要。

Method: 引入ConspirED数据集，基于CONSPIR认知框架对在线阴谋文章的多句摘录进行标注，开发计算模型识别阴谋特征，并评估大型语言/推理模型对阴谋论输入的鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现大型语言模型和推理模型都被阴谋论内容误导，产生反映输入推理模式的输出，即使它们能够成功抵制类似的事实核查错误信息。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了需要开发更强大的AI系统来抵御阴谋论内容的影响，ConspirED数据集为理解和干预阴谋论传播提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Conspiracy theories erode public trust in science and institutions while
resisting debunking by evolving and absorbing counter-evidence. As AI-generated
misinformation becomes increasingly sophisticated, understanding rhetorical
patterns in conspiratorial content is important for developing interventions
such as targeted prebunking and assessing AI vulnerabilities. We introduce
ConspirED (CONSPIR Evaluation Dataset), which captures the cognitive traits of
conspiratorial ideation in multi-sentence excerpts (80--120 words) from online
conspiracy articles, annotated using the CONSPIR cognitive framework
(Lewandowsky and Cook, 2020). ConspirED is the first dataset of conspiratorial
content annotated for general cognitive traits. Using ConspirED, we (i) develop
computational models that identify conspiratorial traits and determine dominant
traits in text excerpts, and (ii) evaluate large language/reasoning model
(LLM/LRM) robustness to conspiratorial inputs. We find that both are misaligned
by conspiratorial content, producing output that mirrors input reasoning
patterns, even when successfully deflecting comparable fact-checked
misinformation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FLORES+基准测试在200多种语言翻译评估中存在质量问题，包括翻译质量低于声称标准、源文本领域特定和文化偏见、命名实体复制可获高分等问题，需要更领域通用和文化中立的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究FLORES+多语言机器翻译基准测试的实际适用性，发现其在真正多语言评估方面存在严重缺陷，需要改进基准测试方法。

Method: 通过人工评估四种语言（Asante Twi、日语、Jinghpaw和南阿塞拜疆语）的翻译质量，分析源文本的领域特定性和文化偏见，测试简单启发式方法对BLEU分数的影响。

Result: 发现许多翻译质量低于声称的90%标准，源文本过于领域特定且偏向英语世界文化，简单命名实体复制就能获得不错的BLEU分数，高质量MT模型在FLORES+上表现不佳但在相关领域评估集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 需要建立使用领域通用、文化中立源文本且较少依赖命名实体的多语言MT基准测试，以更好地反映现实世界的翻译挑战。

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in
evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+
benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over
200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study
data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani)
and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly
multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall
below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source
sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the
English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as
copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting
vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models
trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while
achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on
these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use
domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities,
in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

TL;DR: SciTopic是一种基于大语言模型增强的科学文献主题发现方法，通过构建文本编码器、空间优化模块和LLM指导的对比学习，显著提升了科学主题识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主题发现方法主要依赖词嵌入技术，缺乏对科学文献的全面理解，难以处理复杂的高维文本关系。大语言模型在文本理解方面的卓越能力为解决这一问题提供了新的思路。

Method: 1) 构建包含元数据、标题和摘要的文本编码器；2) 设计基于熵的采样和LLM指导的三元组空间优化模块；3) 通过优化三元组对比损失来微调文本编码器，使其更好地区分不同主题的实例

Conclusion: SciTopic通过整合大语言模型的语义理解能力，有效解决了传统主题发现方法的局限性，为科学文献分析提供了更强大的工具

Abstract: Topic discovery in scientific literature provides valuable insights for
researchers to identify emerging trends and explore new avenues for
investigation, facilitating easier scientific information retrieval. Many
machine learning methods, particularly deep embedding techniques, have been
applied to discover research topics. However, most existing topic discovery
methods rely on word embedding to capture the semantics and lack a
comprehensive understanding of scientific publications, struggling with
complex, high-dimensional text relationships. Inspired by the exceptional
comprehension of textual information by large language models (LLMs), we
propose an advanced topic discovery method enhanced by LLMs to improve
scientific topic identification, namely SciTopic. Specifically, we first build
a textual encoder to capture the content from scientific publications,
including metadata, title, and abstract. Next, we construct a space
optimization module that integrates entropy-based sampling and triplet tasks
guided by LLMs, enhancing the focus on thematic relevance and contextual
intricacies between ambiguous instances. Then, we propose to fine-tune the
textual encoder based on the guidance from the LLMs by optimizing the
contrastive loss of the triplets, forcing the text encoder to better
discriminate instances of different topics. Finally, extensive experiments
conducted on three real-world datasets of scientific publications demonstrate
that SciTopic outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) scientific topic
discovery methods, enabling researchers to gain deeper and faster insights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对多领域非IID数据的自适应联邦蒸馏框架(AdaFD)，并建立了包含语言领域多样性的综合基准测试框架，解决了现有方法只关注标签多样性而忽略输入领域多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦蒸馏方法主要关注标签(output)多样性，而忽略了自然语言处理中至关重要的语言领域(input)多样性，无法真实反映现实环境中的非IID数据挑战。

Method: 提出了自适应联邦蒸馏(AdaFD)框架，设计了一个包含多领域非IID场景的统一基准测试框架，能够处理同质和异质设置下的多领域非IID挑战。

Result: 实验结果表明，该模型能够有效捕捉本地客户端的多样性，在性能上优于现有工作。

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦学习在多领域非IID环境中的评估提供了有效的基准框架，提出的AdaFD方法在真实环境中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new
training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data
from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can
not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address
the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving
federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,
previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label
(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains
(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we
introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a
unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be
used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To
this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework
designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models
capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared
to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统抽取式摘要模型存在多阶段流水线信息损失和语义理解不足的问题，特别是在处理复杂搜索意图时表现不佳，需要更先进的生成式方法。

Method: 集成大模型蒸馏、监督微调、直接偏好优化和前向解码技术，构建仅0.1B参数的轻量级生成模型，专门针对查询驱动文本摘要任务进行优化。

Result: 在多个工业相关指标上超越生产基线，达到新的SOTA性能，部署效率优异，仅需334个NVIDIA L20 GPU即可处理约50,000 QPS，平均延迟55ms。

Conclusion: 生成模型在工业级查询驱动文本摘要任务中具有显著优势，通过精心设计的训练和优化策略，轻量级模型也能实现卓越性能和部署效率。

Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of large-scale web search, Query-Driven Text
Summarization (QDTS) aims to generate concise and informative summaries from
textual documents based on a given query, which is essential for improving user
engagement and facilitating rapid decision-making. Traditional extractive
summarization models, based primarily on ranking candidate summary segments,
have been the dominant approach in industrial applications. However, these
approaches suffer from two key limitations: 1) The multi-stage pipeline often
introduces cumulative information loss and architectural bottlenecks due to its
weakest component; 2) Traditional models lack sufficient semantic understanding
of both user queries and documents, particularly when dealing with complex
search intents. In this study, we propose a novel framework to pioneer the
application of generative models to address real-time QDTS in industrial web
search. Our approach integrates large model distillation, supervised
fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and lookahead decoding to
transform a lightweight model with only 0.1B parameters into a
domain-specialized QDTS expert. Evaluated on multiple industry-relevant
metrics, our model outperforms the production baseline and achieves a new state
of the art. Furthermore, it demonstrates excellent deployment efficiency,
requiring only 334 NVIDIA L20 GPUs to handle \textasciitilde50,000 queries per
second under 55~ms average latency per query.

Result: 知识组合选择准确率提升3.9%，在HotpotQA和2WikiMultihopQA数据集上通过数据增强获得性能改进

Conclusion: KCS有效提升多跳问答的数据多样性和模型性能，为复杂问答任务提供了新的数据增强方法

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering faces substantial challenges due to data
sparsity, which increases the likelihood of language models learning spurious
patterns. To address this issue, prior research has focused on diversifying
question generation through content planning and varied expression. However,
these approaches often emphasize generating simple questions and neglect the
integration of essential knowledge, such as relevant sentences within
documents. This paper introduces the Knowledge Composition Sampling (KCS), an
innovative framework designed to expand the diversity of generated multi-hop
questions by sampling varied knowledge compositions within a given context. KCS
models the knowledge composition selection as a sentence-level conditional
prediction task and utilizes a probabilistic contrastive loss to predict the
next most relevant piece of knowledge. During inference, we employ a stochastic
decoding strategy to effectively balance accuracy and diversity. Compared to
competitive baselines, our KCS improves the overall accuracy of knowledge
composition selection by 3.9%, and its application for data augmentation yields
improvements on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA datasets. Our code is available

TL;DR: 当前图语言模型的评估基准存在缺陷，无法真正评估多模态推理能力。作者提出了新的CLEGR基准来测试图结构和语言的联合推理，发现现有GLM在图推理方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图语言模型评估基准主要基于节点分类数据集，这些基准无法有效评估多模态推理能力，因为仅使用单模态信息就能获得良好表现，不能真正测试图-语言整合的必要性。

Method: 作者引入了CLEGR（组合式语言-图推理）基准，采用合成图生成流水线配合需要结构和文本语义联合推理的问题。对代表性GLM架构进行了全面评估，包括与仅使用软提示的LLM基线的比较。

Result: 研究发现软提示的LLM基线表现与包含完整GNN骨干的GLM相当，质疑了将图结构整合到LLM中的架构必要性。GLM在需要结构推理的任务中表现出显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前GLM在图推理能力方面存在局限性，CLEGR基准为推进图结构与语言的多模态推理研究提供了基础，揭示了需要更有效的架构来真正整合图结构信息。

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural
reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that
current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed
node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal
reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is
achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not
necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we
introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed
to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark
employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that
require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a
thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that
soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full
GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of
incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit
significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning.
These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of
current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward
explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Method: 利用语音声音特征检索候选实体，设计生成式方法来标注ASR转录中的实体错误并用正确实体替换文本

Result: 在开源和自建测试集上验证，该方法能显著提升实体准确率

Conclusion: 该方法在词形差异场景下有效，将开源自建测试集和训练数据

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe
domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream
tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have
been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level
edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the
forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are
significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly
transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel
NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities.
With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a
generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the
text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form
difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test
sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant
improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test
set and training data.

Abstract: This paper introduces the first multi-lingual and multi-label classification
model for implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR). Our model, HArch, is
evaluated on the recently released DiscoGeM 2.0 corpus and leverages
hierarchical dependencies between discourse senses to predict probability
distributions across all three sense levels in the PDTB 3.0 framework. We
compare several pre-trained encoder backbones and find that RoBERTa-HArch
achieves the best performance in English, while XLM-RoBERTa-HArch performs best
in the multi-lingual setting. In addition, we compare our fine-tuned models
against GPT-4o and Llama-4-Maverick using few-shot prompting across all
language configurations. Our results show that our fine-tuned models
consistently outperform these LLMs, highlighting the advantages of
task-specific fine-tuning over prompting in IDRR. Finally, we report SOTA
results on the DiscoGeM 1.0 corpus, further validating the effectiveness of our
hierarchical approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型提升了文本生成能力，但也带来了隐写和水印中的tokenization不一致性问题，这种不一致性会削弱系统的鲁棒性，需要针对性解决方案。

Method: 研究发现导致不一致性的问题token具有低频性和临时性特征，据此提出了两种定制化解决方案：为隐写设计的逐步验证方法，以及为水印设计的后验回滚方法。

Result: 实验表明：1）与传统消歧方法相比，直接处理不一致性问题能提升隐写的流畅性、不可感知性和抗隐写分析能力；2）处理不一致性增强了水印的可检测性和抗攻击鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过识别tokenization不一致性的核心特征并设计针对性解决方案，有效提升了文本隐写和水印技术的性能表现，为防范恶意滥用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Large language models have significantly enhanced the capacities and
efficiency of text generation. On the one hand, they have improved the quality
of text-based steganography. On the other hand, they have also underscored the
importance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this
study, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in
steganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our
investigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit
two key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these
findings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise
verification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for
watermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation
methods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in
fluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for
watermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against
attacks.

TL;DR: rStar2-Agent是一个14B参数的数学推理模型，通过智能体强化学习训练，在有限GPU资源下实现前沿性能，在AIME数学竞赛中超越DeepSeek-R1等大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学推理模型主要依赖长链思维，缺乏自主探索、验证和优化中间步骤的认知能力。需要开发更高效的智能体强化学习方法，在有限计算资源下实现前沿性能。

Method: 采用三项关键技术：(1)高效RL基础设施支持高吞吐量Python代码执行；(2)GRPO-RoC算法处理代码环境噪声；(3)分阶段训练策略从非推理SFT到多阶段RL，逐步培养高级认知能力。

Result: 仅用510步RL训练和一周时间，在AIME24和AIME25上分别达到80.6%和69.8%的pass@1分数，超越DeepSeek-R1(671B)且响应更短。在数学推理之外，还在对齐、科学推理和工具使用任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: rStar2-Agent证明了智能体强化学习在有限计算资源下实现前沿数学推理性能的有效性，为开发更高效的AI智能体提供了新的训练范式和算法创新。

Abstract: We introduce rStar2-Agent, a 14B math reasoning model trained with agentic
reinforcement learning to achieve frontier-level performance. Beyond current
long CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking
carefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution
feedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in
complex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key
innovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL
infrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports
high-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling
training on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic
RL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the
inherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason
more effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training
recipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL
stages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To
this end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in
only 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on
AIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly
shorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates

*Stephen Meisenbacher,Maulik Chevli,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DP-ST方法，利用语义三元组在本地差分隐私下实现邻域感知的私有文档生成，通过分治策略和LLM后处理在较低ε值下平衡隐私与效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有本地差分隐私文本处理需要极高ε值才能保持文本质量，隐私保护与文本效用之间存在严重冲突，需要新的方法来在合理隐私水平下生成连贯文本。

Method: DP-ST方法：1）使用语义三元组进行文档分解；2）在本地差分隐私框架下实现邻域感知的私有化；3）采用分治策略限制隐私邻域；4）结合LLM进行后处理生成连贯文本。

Result: 该方法在较低ε值下仍能生成连贯文本，有效平衡了隐私保护与文本效用，证明了分治策略在文本隐私保护中的有效性。

Conclusion: 语义三元组结合分治策略和LLM后处理是解决本地差分隐私文本生成中隐私-效用权衡的有效方法，文本连贯性对于在合理ε水平下实现平衡至关重要。

Abstract: Many works at the intersection of Differential Privacy (DP) in Natural
Language Processing aim to protect privacy by transforming texts under DP
guarantees. This can be performed in a variety of ways, from word perturbations
to full document rewriting, and most often under local DP. Here, an input text
must be made indistinguishable from any other potential text, within some bound
governed by the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$. Such a guarantee is quite
demanding, and recent works show that privatizing texts under local DP can only
be done reasonably under very high $\varepsilon$ values. Addressing this
challenge, we introduce DP-ST, which leverages semantic triples for
neighborhood-aware private document generation under local DP guarantees.
Through the evaluation of our method, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
divide-and-conquer paradigm, particularly when limiting the DP notion (and
privacy guarantees) to that of a privatization neighborhood. When combined with
LLM post-processing, our method allows for coherent text generation even at
lower $\varepsilon$ values, while still balancing privacy and utility. These
findings highlight the importance of coherence in achieving balanced
privatization outputs at reasonable $\varepsilon$ levels.

*Vassiliy Cheremetiev,Quang Long Ho Ngo,Chau Ying Kot,Alina Elena Baia,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（如Stella、Jasper等），在隐式仇恨言论检测任务上实现了最先进的性能，在跨数据集评估中F1分数提升高达20.35个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式仇恨言论（IHS）使用间接语言表达偏见和仇恨，难以通过传统方法检测，因为它不包含明显的贬义词汇。需要结合外部知识和上下文信息来解决这一挑战。

Method: 仅通过微调基于大语言模型的通用嵌入模型（包括Stella、Jasper、NV-Embed和E5），不依赖额外的外部知识或复杂管道。

Result: 在多个IHS数据集上实验显示，在数据集内评估中F1-macro分数提升最高1.10个百分点，在跨数据集评估中提升高达20.35个百分点。

Conclusion: 微调通用嵌入模型是检测隐式仇恨言论的有效方法，能够显著提升检测性能，特别是在跨数据集场景下表现突出。

Abstract: Implicit hate speech (IHS) is indirect language that conveys prejudice or
hatred through subtle cues, sarcasm or coded terminology. IHS is challenging to
detect as it does not include explicit derogatory or inflammatory words. To
address this challenge, task-specific pipelines can be complemented with
external knowledge or additional information such as context, emotions and
sentiment data. In this paper, we show that, by solely fine-tuning recent
general-purpose embedding models based on large language models (LLMs), such as
Stella, Jasper, NV-Embed and E5, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.
Experiments on multiple IHS datasets show up to 1.10 percentage points
improvements for in-dataset, and up to 20.35 percentage points improvements in
cross-dataset evaluation, in terms of F1-macro score.

TL;DR: GUARD是一种自适应的解码方法，通过全局和局部熵估计平衡文本生成的连贯性和多样性，同时显著提升生成速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放式文本生成中连贯性与多样性平衡的挑战，现有对比搜索方法存在超参数依赖和计算成本高的问题

Method: 提出GUARD方法，结合全局熵估计和局部熵偏差的"Glocal"不确定性驱动框架，并加入基于token计数的惩罚机制来降低计算开销

Result: 实验证明GUARD在文本多样性和连贯性之间取得良好平衡，生成速度有显著提升，人工和LLM评估均验证其优异性能

Conclusion: GUARD通过创新的不确定性驱动框架有效解决了文本生成的质量-效率权衡问题，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Open-ended text generation faces a critical challenge: balancing coherence
with diversity in LLM outputs. While contrastive search-based decoding
strategies have emerged to address this trade-off, their practical utility is
often limited by hyperparameter dependence and high computational costs. We
introduce GUARD, a self-adaptive decoding method that effectively balances
these competing objectives through a novel "Glocal" uncertainty-driven
framework. GUARD combines global entropy estimates with local entropy
deviations to integrate both long-term and short-term uncertainty signals. We
demonstrate that our proposed global entropy formulation effectively mitigates
abrupt variations in uncertainty, such as sudden overconfidence or high entropy
spikes, and provides theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness and consistency. To
reduce computational overhead, we incorporate a simple yet effective
token-count-based penalty into GUARD. Experimental results demonstrate that
GUARD achieves a good balance between text diversity and coherence, while
exhibiting substantial improvements in generation speed. In a more nuanced
comparison study across different dimensions of text quality, both human and
LLM evaluators validated its remarkable performance. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比分析了真实与LLM生成的认知行为疗法对话在情感动态方面的差异，发现合成对话在情感变化、语言丰富度和反应模式上与真实会话存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成的合成疗法对话在心理健康NLP中广泛使用，需要评估这些合成对话是否能够准确投射真实疗法中的细微情感动态。

Method: 采用Utterance Emotion Dynamics框架分析价值(valence)、舌动(arousal)和主导(dominance)维度的情感轨迹，对比公开视频转诐的真实CBT会话和CACTUS数据集中的合成对话。

Result: 真实会话呈现出更高的情感变化性、更丰富的情感语言和更真实的反应调节模式。真实与合成讲者之间的情感轨迹相似度低，尤其是客户端。

Conclusion: 当前LLM生成的疗法数据在情感保真度方面存在显著局限性，心理健康应用中应重视情感准确性。研究们提供了RealCBT数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: Synthetic therapy dialogues generated by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used in mental health NLP to simulate counseling scenarios, train
models, and supplement limited real-world data. However, it remains unclear
whether these synthetic conversations capture the nuanced emotional dynamics of
real therapy. In this work, we conduct the first comparative analysis of
emotional arcs between real and LLM-generated Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
dialogues. We adapt the Utterance Emotion Dynamics framework to analyze
fine-grained affective trajectories across valence, arousal, and dominance
dimensions. Our analysis spans both full dialogues and individual speaker roles
(counselor and client), using real sessions transcribed from public videos and
synthetic dialogues from the CACTUS dataset. We find that while synthetic
dialogues are fluent and structurally coherent, they diverge from real
conversations in key emotional properties: real sessions exhibit greater
emotional variability,more emotion-laden language, and more authentic patterns
of reactivity and regulation. Moreover, emotional arc similarity between real
and synthetic speakers is low, especially for clients. These findings
underscore the limitations of current LLM-generated therapy data and highlight
the importance of emotional fidelity in mental health applications. We
introduce RealCBT, a curated dataset of real CBT sessions, to support future
research in this space.

TL;DR: ROSI是一种白盒方法，通过秩一权重修改来增强LLM的安全对齐，无需微调即可提高拒绝有害请求的能力，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制容易被绕过，需要一种简单有效的方法来增强LLM的安全对齐能力，而不影响模型实用性。

Method: 提出Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI)方法，通过计算安全方向并对所有残差流写入矩阵进行秩一权重修改，永久引导激活向量朝向拒绝介导子空间。

Result: ROSI显著提高了安全拒绝率（Llama Guard 3评估），同时在MMLU、HellaSwag和Arc等标准基准测试中保持了模型性能，还能重新对齐'未审查'模型。

Conclusion: 定向、可解释的权重引导是一种廉价而有效的LLM安全改进机制，可作为资源密集型微调范式的补充。

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated
approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text.
One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational
thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early
detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While
prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth
study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive
distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our
findings show that while changes in language and writing style can
significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most
promise.

Result: 在两个公开数据集TB-Dense和MATRES上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了少数关系类的表现和整体学习能力

Conclusion: GDLLM框架通过有效捕获全局特征，能够显著增强少数关系类的性能并提升整体学习能力，为事件时序关系提取提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing(NLP), Event Temporal Relation Extraction
(ETRE) is to recognize the temporal relations of two events. Prior studies have
noted the importance of language models for ETRE. However, the restricted
pre-trained knowledge of Small Language Models(SLMs) limits their capability to
handle minority class relations in imbalanced classification datasets. For
Large Language Models(LLMs), researchers adopt manually designed prompts or
instructions, which may introduce extra noise, leading to interference with the
model's judgment of the long-distance dependencies between events. To address
these issues, we propose GDLLM, a Global Distance-aware modeling approach based
on LLMs. We first present a distance-aware graph structure utilizing Graph
Attention Network(GAT) to assist the LLMs in capturing long-distance dependency
features. Additionally, we design a temporal feature learning paradigm based on
soft inference to augment the identification of relations with a short-distance
proximity band, which supplements the probabilistic information generated by
LLMs into the multi-head attention mechanism. Since the global feature can be
captured effectively, our framework substantially enhances the performance of
minority relation classes and improves the overall learning ability.
Experiments on two publicly available datasets, TB-Dense and MATRES,
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统评估通常假设信息都在单个来源中，而真实应用需要从多个分散来源中综合信息并生成长文本回答。

Method: 提出可扩展的评测框架，构建了两个新的多源检索和综合评测集，对各种RAG流水线（包括稀疏和浓密检索器）进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验结果显示生成质量很大程度依赖于检索效果，而检索效果因任务而异。多源综合在即使在oracle检索设置下也很具挑战性，理论模型在这一步骤表现显著超过标准LLM。

Conclusion: 这项研究为评估需要多源信息综合的RAG系统提供了一个重要的评测框架，并证明了检索效果对生成质量的关键影响以及理论模型在多源综合任务中的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented systems are typically evaluated in settings where
information required to answer the query can be found within a single source or
the answer is short-form or factoid-based. However, many real-world
applications demand the ability to integrate and summarize information
scattered across multiple sources, where no single source is sufficient to
respond to the user's question. In such settings, the retrieval component of a
RAG pipeline must recognize a variety of relevance signals, and the generation
component must connect and synthesize information across multiple sources. We
present a scalable framework for constructing evaluation benchmarks that
challenge RAG systems to integrate information across distinct sources and
generate long-form responses. Using our framework, we build two new benchmarks
on Multi-Source Retrieval and Synthesis: MSRS-Story and MSRS-Meet, representing
narrative synthesis and summarization tasks, respectively, that require
retrieval from large collections. Our extensive experiments with various RAG
pipelines -- including sparse and dense retrievers combined with frontier LLMs
-- reveal that generation quality is highly dependent on retrieval
effectiveness, which varies greatly by task. While multi-source synthesis
proves challenging even in an oracle retrieval setting, we find that reasoning
models significantly outperform standard LLMs at this distinct step.

Motivation: 量化技术对于在资源受限硬件上部署大语言模型至关重要，但其在多语言任务上的影响仍未得到充分研究。本文旨在全面评估后训练量化在机器翻译任务上的表现，以了解量化对不同语言类型的影响。

Method: 使用5个参数量从1.7B到70B的大语言模型，在55种语言上进行机器翻译评测。比较四种量化技术（AWQ、BitsAndBytes、GGUF和AutoRound），分析4位和2位精度下的表现。还研究了量化与解码超参数、检验语料语言之间的交互作用。

Result: 研究发现：1）4位量化在高资源语言和大模型上能保持翻译质量；2）2位量化在低资源和语言类型多样的语言上出现显著性能下降；3）GGUF方法在2位精度下表现最稳定；4）语言匹配的检验语料在低位量化中有显著好处。

Conclusion: 量化算法选择和模型大小共同决定了多语言机器翻译的稳健性。研究结果为在量化约束下部署多语言大模型提供了可操作的见解，尤其是在低资源语言环境中。

Abstract: Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) on
resource-constrained hardware, but its implications for multilingual tasks
remain underexplored. We conduct the first large-scale evaluation of
post-training quantization (PTQ) on machine translation across 55 languages
using five LLMs ranging from 1.7B to 70B parameters. Our analysis reveals that
while 4-bit quantization often preserves translation quality for high-resource
languages and large models, significant degradation occurs for low-resource and
typologically diverse languages, particularly in 2-bit settings. We compare
four quantization techniques (AWQ, BitsAndBytes, GGUF, and AutoRound), showing
that algorithm choice and model size jointly determine robustness. GGUF
variants provide the most consistent performance, even at 2-bit precision.
Additionally, we quantify the interactions between quantization, decoding
hyperparameters, and calibration languages, finding that language-matched
calibration offers benefits primarily in low-bit scenarios. Our findings offer
actionable insights for deploying multilingual LLMs for machine translation
under quantization constraints, especially in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Speech-to-Speech (S2S) Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling end-to-end spoken dialogue
systems. However, evaluating these models remains a fundamental challenge. We
propose \texttt{SageLM}, an end-to-end, multi-aspect, and explainable speech
LLM for comprehensive S2S LLMs evaluation. First, unlike cascaded approaches
that disregard acoustic features, SageLM jointly assesses both semantic and
acoustic dimensions. Second, it leverages rationale-based supervision to
enhance explainability and guide model learning, achieving superior alignment
with evaluation outcomes compared to rule-based reinforcement learning methods.
Third, we introduce \textit{SpeechFeedback}, a synthetic preference dataset,
and employ a two-stage training paradigm to mitigate the scarcity of speech
preference data. Trained on both semantic and acoustic dimensions, SageLM
achieves an 82.79\% agreement rate with human evaluators, outperforming
cascaded and SLM-based baselines by at least 7.42\% and 26.20\%, respectively.

Conclusion: IRMA框架在动态环境中展现出卓越的可靠性和一致性，为解决LLM在多轮工具调用对话中的挑战提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning and planning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) have enabled their potential as autonomous agents capable of tool
use in dynamic environments. However, in multi-turn conversational environments
like $\tau$-bench, these agents often struggle with consistent reasoning,
adherence to domain-specific policies, and extracting correct information over
a long horizon of tool-calls and conversation. To capture and mitigate these
failures, we conduct a comprehensive manual analysis of the common errors
occurring in the conversation trajectories. We then experiment with
reformulations of inputs to the tool-calling agent for improvement in agent
decision making. Finally, we propose the Input-Reformulation Multi-Agent (IRMA)
framework, which automatically reformulates user queries augmented with
relevant domain rules and tool suggestions for the tool-calling agent to focus
on. The results show that IRMA significantly outperforms ReAct, Function
Calling, and Self-Reflection by 16.1%, 12.7%, and 19.1%, respectively, in
overall pass^5 scores. These findings highlight the superior reliability and
consistency of IRMA compared to other methods in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有的上下文学习示例选择策略在结构化预测任务中忽视了结构对齐，导致性能不佳和泛化能力差。

Result: 在四个语义解析任务的标准数据集上，该方法均超越现有基线方法，适用于多种最新大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在效率、泛化能力和性能之间实现良好平衡，为结构化预测任务提供了有效的上下文学习示例选择方案。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has become a powerful paradigm that enables LLMs to
perform a wide range of tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. However, the
effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the quality of exemplar selection. In
particular, for structured prediction tasks such as semantic parsing, existing
ICL selection strategies often overlook structural alignment, leading to
suboptimal performance and poor generalization. To address this issue, we
propose a novel two-stage exemplar selection strategy that achieves a strong
balance between efficiency, generalizability, and performance. First, we
fine-tune a BERT-based retriever using structure-aware supervision, guiding it
to select exemplars that are both semantically relevant and structurally
aligned. Then, we enhance the retriever with a plug-in module, which amplifies
syntactically meaningful information in the hidden representations. This
plug-in is model-agnostic, requires minimal overhead, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing pipelines. Experiments on four benchmarks spanning
three semantic parsing tasks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing baselines with multiple recent LLMs as inference-time
models.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem
in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus
on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented
evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive
conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified
framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This
framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue
guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it
also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation
data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments
spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of
LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional
performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively.
Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive
behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Motivation: 现有后门防御方法存在局限性，无法全面应对模型编辑、多触发器和无触发器等高级攻击场景，需要更全面的防御方案

Method: 内部机制：使用轻量级数据集训练干净模型，与后门模型融合以稀释后门影响；外部机制：在提示中加入良性相关证据分散模型对后门特征的注意力

Conclusion: LETHE是一种成本效益高、鲁棒性强的后门消除方法，能够有效应对自适应后门攻击，为LLM安全提供了全面解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, achieving
superior performance in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where models behave
normally for standard queries but generate harmful responses or unintended
output when specific triggers are activated. Existing backdoor defenses either
lack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only
mechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like
model-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we
present LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through
knowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms. Internally,
LETHE leverages a lightweight dataset to train a clean model, which is then
merged with the backdoored model to neutralize malicious behaviors by diluting
the backdoor impact within the model's parametric memory. Externally, LETHE
incorporates benign and semantically relevant evidence into the prompt to
distract LLM's attention from backdoor features. Experimental results on
classification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate
that LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor
attacks. LETHE reduces the attack success rate of advanced backdoor attacks by
up to 98% while maintaining model utility. Furthermore, LETHE has proven to be

Conclusion: EASI-RAG证明了RAG技术在中小企业工业环境中的部署潜力，未来需要扩展到更多用例并与微调模型进一步集成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful solution to
mitigate the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
hallucinations and outdated knowledge. However, deploying RAG-based tools in
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) remains a challenge due to their limited
resources and lack of expertise in natural language processing (NLP). This
paper introduces EASI-RAG, Enterprise Application Support for Industrial RAG, a
structured, agile method designed to facilitate the deployment of RAG systems
in industrial SME contexts. EASI-RAG is based on method engineering principles
and comprises well-defined roles, activities, and techniques. The method was
validated through a real-world case study in an environmental testing
laboratory, where a RAG tool was implemented to answer operators queries using
data extracted from operational procedures. The system was deployed in under a
month by a team with no prior RAG experience and was later iteratively improved
based on user feedback. Results demonstrate that EASI-RAG supports fast
implementation, high user adoption, delivers accurate answers, and enhances the
reliability of underlying data. This work highlights the potential of RAG
deployment in industrial SMEs. Future works include the need for generalization
across diverse use cases and further integration with fine-tuned models.

*Ramazan Ali Bahrami,Ramin Yahyapour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出使用胶囊网络中的动态路由进行句子关系抽取，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法，但发现在大规模数据集Wikidata上性能较低，主要原因是标签噪声和重表示能力不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子关系抽取是NLP中的重要任务，现有方法在大规模数据集上性能不佳，需要探索更有效的模型来处理标签噪声和提升表示能力。

Method: 采用胶囊网络中的动态路由机制进行句子关系抽取，通过动态路由来改善实体关系的表示学习。

Result: 在Tacred、Tacredrev、Retacred和Conll04数据集上取得了state-of-the-art性能，但在Wikidata数据集上表现较差，发现标签噪声是主要原因。

Conclusion: 除了标签噪声问题外，重表示能力也是句子关系抽取的重要挑战，提出的胶囊网络方法在重表示方面优于基准模型。

Abstract: Sentential relation extraction (RE) is an important task in natural language
processing (NLP). In this paper we propose to do sentential RE with dynamic
routing in capsules. We first show that the proposed approach outperform state
of the art on common sentential relation extraction datasets Tacred, Tacredrev,
Retacred, and Conll04. We then investigate potential reasons for its good
performance on the mentioned datasets, and yet low performance on another
similar, yet larger sentential RE dataset, Wikidata. As such, we identify noise
in Wikidata labels as one of the reasons that can hinder performance.
Additionally, we show associativity of better performance with better
re-representation, a term from neuroscience referred to change of
representation in human brain to improve the match at comparison time. As
example, in the given analogous terms King:Queen::Man:Woman, at comparison
time, and as a result of re-representation, the similarity between related head
terms (King,Man), and tail terms (Queen,Woman) increases. As such, our
observation show that our proposed model can do re-representation better than
the vanilla model compared with. To that end, beside noise in the labels of the
distantly supervised RE datasets, we propose re-representation as a challenge
in sentential RE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合大型语言模型和符号求解器的神经符号架构，用于自动化税务申报计算，在SARA数据集上表现出色且部署成本低于现实世界平均成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 税务申报需要复杂的规则推理和数值计算，传统方法容易出错且成本高昂，而纯LLM方法缺乏可审计性和高精度要求。

Method: 整合LLM与符号求解器，将文本规则翻译为形式逻辑程序，结合智能检索的案例表示范例来提升性能。

Result: 系统在SARA数据集上表现优异，部署成本显著低于现实世界平均的270美元和13小时。

Conclusion: 神经符号架构为提供可靠、公平的税务援助服务展示了可行性和经济性前景。

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average
American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the
U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of
overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly
penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability,
making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We
propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate
tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging
StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for
estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties
for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of
plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently
retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve
performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages.
Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic
architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的幻觉问题，需要一种简单有效的对齐方法来减少正确图像输入下的错误回答

Method: 利用CHAIR指标识别幻觉和非幻觉样本，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)对现有MLLMs进行微调

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量

Conclusion: 基于CHAIR的奖励计量通过DPO对齐训练是一种简单有效的方法，能够显著提升MLLMs的可靠性

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜在空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法，在多个数据集上较现有方法提升12%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上新一代多模态大模型驱动的图像编辑技术发展。

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将图像伪造残差（通过高通滤波器提取的高频信号）作为显式模态融入潜在空间，在保留输入图像丰富语义信息的同时增强伪造定位性能。

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较现有最佳方法提升了达12%的性能，并在训练时未见过的真实文档伪造图像和自然场景伪造图像上也表现出强劲的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将SD的图像生成和知觉能力集成到图像例证框架中，为应对新一代多模态大模型带来的图像伪造挑战提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但预测结果的可解释性不足限制了其临床应用。需要提高模型决策的透明度以增强临床实用性。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）和定量属性分析。通过微调MLLM使其能从皮肤病变图像预测定量属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明MLLM的嵌入空间可以有效地与定量属性进行关联，模型能够从图像中准确预测与恶性病变相关的定量属性值。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合的方法为提高皮肤疾病AI诊断的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过将预测结果基于可理解的概念来增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重构目标，在少量标注数据下实现自动调制识别的优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器的统一框架，通过重构分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标注监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标注情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR水平下保持强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法在生成高分辨率、长时长视频时存在身份漂移、颜色偏移、场景不稳定和手部运动建模不佳的问题，需要一种能够保持外观一致性和自然手部动作的解决方案。

Method: 提出coarse-to-fine框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导的细化器逐步细化为高分辨率视频；利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移；引入手部特定奖励机制提升手势真实感。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，成功解决了音频驱动人体动画中的关键挑战，能够生成高质量、长时间、外观一致的自然人体动画视频。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度音视频显著性预测数据集，以及需要处理球面扭曲和空间音频集成的复杂性，这项研究开发了YT360-EyeTracking数据集并探索如何利用音视频线索来预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 研究构建了包含81个全向视频的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，每个视频在不同音视频条件下观察。提出了两种新模型：SalViT360（基于视觉Transformer的框架，配备球面几何感知空间-时间注意力层）和SalViT360-AV（进一步集成了基于音频输入的Transformer适配器）。

Result: 在多个标准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的结果显示，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV显著超过了现有方法在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 研究认为，在模型架构中集成空间音频线索对于准确预测全向视频中的显著性至关重要。这项研究为360度音视频显著性预测领域提供了重要的数据集和方法进展。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 传统语音识别系统对听障人士不可访问，而现有的视觉替代方案（手语和唇读）通常被孤立研究，缺乏统一的集成框架来探索多模态协同效应。

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关架构，能够有效处理异构输入，特别关注唇部运动作为非手动线索在手语理解中的作用，并探索不同模态之间的协同效应。

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR等任务上达到或优于最先进的专用模型性能，分析表明将唇部运动作为独立模态显式建模能显著提升手语翻译性能。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功整合了多种通信模态，证明了多模态协同的重要性，特别是唇部运动在手语理解中的关键作用，为无障碍通信技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标（如准确率、IoU、mAP），而由于xAI方法应用的复杂性，对模型可解释性的关注较少。现有xAI方法多为样本级解释，缺乏对模型在大型数据集上整体行为的解释方法。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型构建pipeline，在样本级和数据集级两个层面解释视觉模型。该pipeline能够以最小工作量发现模型失败案例并获得对模型行为的深入理解。

Result: 提出的pipeline能够有效解释视觉模型的整体行为，识别模型偏见，发现趋势和模式，并将视觉模型开发与xAI分析相结合。

Conclusion: 该方法推进了图像分析领域，通过集成可解释性分析到视觉模型开发流程中，有助于防止有偏判断并提升模型透明度。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable

*Anastasios Skoularikis,Stefanos-Iordanis Papadopoulos,Symeon Papadopoulos,Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-HArM数据集用于意图感知分类，包含9,576个社交媒体图像-文本对，标注为幽默/讽刺、艺术或虚假信息。通过三种提示策略构建合成训练数据，研究发现图像和多模态引导的数据在泛化性能上表现更好，但整体性能有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI方法主要关注检测合成和上下文无关内容，但忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图识别，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建S-HArM多模态数据集，使用三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）通过Stable Diffusion生成大规模合成训练数据，比较了多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 图像引导和多模态引导的合成数据训练的模型在真实场景内容上泛化性能更好，因为保留了视觉上下文信息，但整体分类性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 推断图像生成意图具有复杂性，需要专门的架构设计，当前方法在意图识别任务上仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5的自动化轮空间分割模型，在T2加权MRI数据上达到了预期的分割效果，但在异质性T1加权数据上性能有所下降，并未超过nnU-Net模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割轮空间(PVS)耗时且可靠性中等，现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稽逆性不佳，需要开发更高性能的自动化分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积神经网络MedNeXt-L-k5，训练了两个模型：一个使用同质性T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用异质性T1加权数据。评估方法包括5折交叉验证和留一地点交叉验证。

Result: 在T2加权数据上达到了Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），与手动分割可靠性相当，为目前文献最高。在T1加权数据上性能下降至Dice分数0.58±0.09（白质）。在异质性数据交叉验证中，模型性能进一步下降。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种高效的自动化PVS分割方案，但没有超过nnU-Net模型，说明Transformer模型中的全局上下文注意机制并非PVS分割任务的必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP的语义分割方法存在定位问题，本文提出一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，通过将输出层的片段级对应关系适应到中间注意力机制，提升空间一致性和表现性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然具有强大的视觉-文本对齐能力，但在开放词汇分割任务中存在定位准确性不足的问题。之前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作，这种一致性无法一致传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表征的直接交互。

Method: 提出了一种无需训练的反馈驱动自适应框架，将输出层的片段级对应关系适应到中间注意力机制。设计了关键模块包括注意力隔离、基于稳定性的剪枝算法和适应集成，以有效反馈输出层的空间一致性线索。

Result: 该方法作为插入模块无缝集成到4种先进方法中，支持三种核心网络（ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。在8个标准数据集上均实现了一致性的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将最终预测作为更强的空间一致性先验知识，该框架有效增强了内部表征与最终预测之间的语义一致性，充分发挥了CLIP模型的潜力。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Gaetan Brison,Soobash Daiboo,Samy Aimeur,Awais Hussain Sani,Xi Wang,Gianni Franchi,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型的局部深度伪造技术，通过在真实视频中进行细微的区域或时间片段修改，比传统深度伪造更具欺骗性。研究者创建了FakePartsBench基准数据集，并发现这种技术使人类和AI检测准确率下降30%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，而局部细微修改的伪造视频更具欺骗性且缺乏专门的检测方法，需要填补这一技术空白。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造技术，创建了包含2.5万+视频的FakePartsBench基准数据集，提供像素级和帧级标注，并进行用户研究和SOTA检测模型评估。

Result: 实验显示FakeParts使人类检测准确率下降30%以上，现有最佳检测模型也出现类似性能下降，暴露了当前检测方法的严重漏洞。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测系统对局部修改的脆弱性，提供了必要的数据资源来开发更鲁棒的局部视频篡改检测方法。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

### [86] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的方式，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉基础处理，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其内部处理动态仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解模型如何处理多模态信息。

Method: 训练线性分类器从每个层的token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构，整体结构在不同视觉标记化、指令调优数据和预训练语料变化下保持稳定，但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著调整。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的层次组织提供了统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为概念特定的稀疏线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假设CLIP等视觉-语言联合嵌入空间可以解耦，将复杂场景的内容信息分解到不同子空间中，每个概念对应特定的稀疏线性子空间。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计线性合成模型，包含稀疏、非负的字典向量组合，组间活动匹配多标签信息。通过新颖的交替优化算法优化分组结构字典。

Result: SLiCS提供的解耦嵌入能够实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成，在TiTok压缩嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上都显示出改进的检索精度。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间方法成功实现了嵌入空间的语义解耦，为概念级别的图像检索和生成任务提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

Motivation: 医疗视觉-语言模型虽然有广阔的临床应用前景，但存在严重的安全风险，包括健康信息泄漏、数据泄露和网络攻击漏洞。医疗机构需要一种方案来安全地部署和使用这些模型

Method: 开发了MedFoundationHub图形界面工具包，支持医生手动选择模型无需编程知识，通过Docker容器化部署保证隐私安全，只需本地工作站和单颗NVIDIA A6000 GPU

Result: 评估了5个先进医疗VLMs模型，通过路径专家进行1015次评分，发现了几个一致的限制：偏离目标的答案、模糊的推理过程、不一致的病理学术语

Conclusion: 医疗VLMs虽有强大潜力，但存在实际应用的技术挑战和安全风险。MedFoundationHub提供了一种安全、易用的部署方案，同时也曝露了当前模型在临床应用中的具体缺陷

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题

Method: 提出双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)机制构建任务特定表示作为双向序列，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context基准测试中优于最先进方法

Conclusion: BIM通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互完整性与计算效率矛盾

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的综合实验表明，该框架能够通过融合音频的丰富信息来处理复杂编辑场景，而仅仅依靠文本的方法则无法完成。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种无需训练的音频导航视觉编辑方案，能够有效处理复杂的多模态编辑任务，充分利用音频信息来补充纯文本导向方法的不足。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该框架显著推进了多标签分类，达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML任务中的噪声和标注不足问题，为多标签学习提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能不佳，主要存在异质脉冲模式导致的残留膜电位问题

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并提出tdIF神经元架构使IF神经元能根据时间步长时序动态调整积累和放电行为

Result: 在目标检测和车道线检测两个关键视觉任务上，该方法超越了当前ANN-SNN转换方法，实现了超低延迟下的最先进性能

Conclusion: tdIF方法能够以更少的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相同能耗的同时，显著提升了SNN在视觉检测任务中的性能

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、边缘模糊，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构和边缘区域的检测精度

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)传播层间不确定性，提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)加权融合RGB、深度和边缘特征的注意力图，使用多尺度损失和不确定性引导监督机制

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过不确定性传播和多模态协同融合有效提升了显著目标检测的性能，特别是在复杂场景下的表现

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Method: MSMVD方法从多视角图像中提取多尺度图像特征，逐尺度投影到BEV空间生成多尺度BEV特征，然后使用特征金字塔网络融合不同尺度的多视角信息

Result: 在GMVD数据集上，MSMVD比之前最好的MODA指标提升了4.5个点，证明多尺度图像特征通过多尺度BEV特征能显著提升检测性能

Conclusion: 通过多尺度BEV特征生成和特征金字塔融合，MSMVD有效解决了多视角行人检测中的尺度不一致问题，取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: SFMFNet为实时深作假检测提供了一种轻量级但高效的解决方案，在保持高检测准确性的同时满足实时性要求。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际医疗场景中部署大型模型受计算资源限制的问题，需要开发既轻量又高性能的医学图像分类模型

Method: 采用双模型权重选择策略从大型预训练模型初始化两个轻量模型，然后应用自知识蒸馏技术进行知识迁移，最后针对目标任务进行微调

Result: 在胸部X光、肺部CT和脑部MRI等多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更优越的性能和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 双模型权重选择与自知识蒸馏的结合有效克服了传统方法在紧凑模型中保留关键信息的局限性，为医学图像分类提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种高效的LiDAR点云压缩方法FastPCC，通过几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，在保持高压缩比的同时实现了实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高精度LiDAR扫描产生大量数据，存储和传输成本高。现有方法将无序点云转换为八叉树或正方体结构进行预测编码，但极端稀疏的几何细节导致上下文建模效率低，限制了压缩性能和速度。

Method: 提出了两个轻量级模块：1）几何重密化模块：对编码后的稀疏几何进行重密化，在更密集尺度提取特征，然后重新稀疏化用于预测编码；2）跨尺度特征传播模块：利用多分辨率占位线索来指导层次特征传播，减少重复特征提取。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到了最先进的压缩比和实时性能，在12位量化下实现了编码和解码都达到26 FPS的速度。

Conclusion: 通过集成几何重密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，该方法能够生成简洁的特征表示，提供高效的上下文建模并加速编码过程，为LiDAR点云压缩领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出Droplet3D方法，利用视频数据中的常识先验来解决3D生成中的数据稀缺问题，通过构建大规模多视角视频数据集和生成模型，实现空间一致且语义合理的3D内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D领域面临数据稀缺问题，相比文本和图像，互联网上的3D数据量有限。视频数据包含丰富的空间一致性先验和语义信息，可以作为替代监督信号来缓解3D生成中的泛化瓶颈。

Method: 构建Droplet3D-4M数据集（首个大规模多视角标注视频数据集），训练Droplet3D生成模型，支持图像和密集文本输入，利用视频中的空间一致性和语义先验进行3D生成。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，能够生成空间一致且语义合理的3D内容，相比主流3D解决方案，还展现出扩展到场景级应用的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频中的常识先验显著促进了3D创作，所有资源（数据集、代码、技术框架和模型权重）均已开源。

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

Conclusion: 将领域特定解剖学先验知识整合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀缺但临床重要疾病的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is

Motivation: 现有长视频理解方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂度高和端到端训练不足导致的性能次优问题。

Method: 提出多轮推理框架，逐步选择视频片段；引入门控双层次奖励系统（轨迹级和轮次级奖励），优化片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过迭代推理和端到端训练，显著提升了长视频理解性能，推动了该领域的技术发展。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

Conclusion: DUO框架通过联合优化语义和几何不确定性，有效解决了单目3D目标检测在真实世界域偏移下的可靠性问题，为安全关键应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署能力。受人类多模态协调机制启发，需要开发更高效的框架。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Motivation: 3D点云异常检测缺乏像2D那样强大的预训练基础骨干网络，现有多模态融合方法容易受性能较差的模态影响而降低整体精度

Method: IAENet集成框架结合2D预训练专家和3D专家模型，引入重要性感知融合(IAF)模块动态评估各源贡献并重新加权异常分数，设计关键损失函数优化IAF

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D模态的优势，提升了工业表面异常检测的实用性价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit是一个基于描述性提示的图像编辑框架，将指令式编辑重新定义为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，避免了重建误差和数据集限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中语义图像编辑的挑战，现有方法存在重建误差和数据集质量限制的问题。

Method: 提出Cross-Attentive UNet架构，通过注意力桥接将参考图像特征注入到提示到编辑图像的生成过程中，保持文本到图像模型的生成能力。

Result: 在Emu Edit基准测试中显示编辑准确性和一致性得到提升，能够与ControlNet、IP-Adapter等扩展无缝集成。

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit框架通过重新定义编辑任务为基于参考图像的生成，克服了指令数据集质量限制，具有更好的可扩展性和编辑性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和错误累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在错误累积问题。需要一种方法来全面捕捉目标域数据的特征表示并减少噪声。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的完整特征表示解耦成语义相关特征和域相关特征，保持子特征与完整特征的一致性。设置自适应阈值计算样本置信度，进行损失加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知学习，能够全面捕捉数据特征，有效减少伪标签噪声并缓解错误累积问题，在持续测试时适应任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 相机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而真实场景缺乏真实地标

Method: 使用3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)模型，通过回传新视角颜色损失来优化相机参数，实现相机标定的细致调整

Result: 在3DGS参考数据集上，新的标定方法带来平均0.4 dB PSNR的提升，虽然调整过程可能耗时，但对于参考场景的标定质量提升意义重大

Conclusion: 通过深度学习模型进行相机标定细化是有效的方法，尤其适用于对新视角质量要求极高的重要场景标定

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Result: 在多种肿瘤体积分割任务上验证，方法显著优于现有最先进的主动域适应方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了医学图像标注成本，提升了分割性能，为多模态医学数据的主动学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的数据层面融合框架，通过将RGB图像和LiDAR数据在早期融合，利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计，通过双向融合和迭代精炼技术，显著提升了无监督3D物体检测的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的LiDAR基于3D物体检测器依赖于手动标注进行训练，而获取高质量3D标签耗时耗力。虽然最近的无监督方法通过RGB图像辅助伪盒生成，但仅仅在标签层面融合带来有限改善，忽视了LiDAR和RGB数据在补充性上的潜力。

Method: 提出数据层面融合框架：1）利用视觉基础模型进行实例分割和深度估计；2）双向融合方法，让3D点获取2D类别标签，将2D像素投影到3D增强点密度；3）局部和全局筛选方法消除深度估计和分割噪声；4）基于数据融合的动态自我迭代策略，迭代精炼伪盒位置准确性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上进行了涉广实验，训练的检测器在nuScenes验证集上达到28.4%的mAP，显著超过之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过早期数据层面融合、双向信息交换和噪声消除等技术，有效解决了伪标签质量问题，为无监督3D物体检测领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中表现出色且具有实用价值。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡和变形等图像退化问题，现有方法通过特征聚合和复杂后处理提升性能但计算成本高，需要在不增加推理负担的情况下提升鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练早期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐侧重检测任务。

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最优性能且无需额外后处理。

Conclusion: CLAB方法简单有效，通过对比学习和动态权重策略显著提升视频目标检测性能，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下达到了state-of-the-art水平。

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致定向错误分类、恶意内容生成和VLM越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在此类攻击下的脆弱性并开发有效防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型中负责提取和传输排版信息的专用注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御攻击，无需微调。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间提供更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的可缓存架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了新的技术方案和数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Conclusion: PI-GenMFI能有效生成高质量的合成MFI图像，为机器学习算法提供训练数据，显著优化半导体缺陷定位过程，具有重要应用价值

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了数据重构攻击的效果和通用性，呈现出在深层网络中的强大攻击能力，对分布式推理安全构成了重大威胁。

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Conclusion: 该方法为对齐LVLMs提供了更有效的解决方案，实现了自主的多模态对齐改进

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

Method: 提出循环变分自编码器建模时空依赖，使用两个后验模型进行双心室分割和运动估计，通过分割图递归配准而非强度相似性损失来引导框架关注解剖区域。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面优于最先进方法，且产生的不确定性值更低，表明预测置信度更高。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的贝叶斯深度学习框架成功解决了传统强度相似性损失的局限性，为心脏功能评估提供了更准确可靠的运动估计方法。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于非典型有丝分裂图像分类的域鲁棒训练方法，通过风格扰动、注意力特征对齐和EMA教师蒸馏，在MIDOG 2025挑战赛中获得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非典型有丝分裂图像(AMFs)是重要的组织病理学标记，但在不同扫描仪、染色和采集条件下存在域偏移问题，导致识别一致性差

Method: 1)在骨干网络早期和中期插入风格扰动增加特征多样性；2)使用弱域标签通过辅助对齐损失跨站点对齐注意力精炼特征；3)通过温度缩放KL散度从EMA教师模型蒸馏以稳定预测

Result: 在MIDOG 2025初步排行榜上获得：平衡准确率0.8762、灵敏度0.8873、特异性0.8651、ROC AUC 0.9499

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

TL;DR: 提出Pref-GRPO方法解决T2I生成中的奖励破解问题，使用成对偏好奖励替代点式评分；同时构建UniGenBench基准测试，包含600个提示和精细评估标准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点式奖励模型的T2I生成方法容易受到奖励破解影响，微小分数差异在归一化后被放大，导致模型过度优化琐碎增益，破坏生成稳定性

Method: Pref-GRPO：基于成对偏好奖励的GRPO方法，在组内对图像进行成对比较，使用胜率作为奖励信号，将优化目标从分数最大化转向偏好拟合

Result: 实验表明Pref-GRPO能够区分细微的图像质量差异，提供更稳定的优势并缓解奖励破解；UniGenBench基准测试揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型的优缺点

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO方法有效解决了奖励破解问题，UniGenBench为T2I模型提供了更全面的评估框架，验证了新方法的有效性

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Motivation: 现有方法在稀疏输入视图下难以编码判别性、多视图一致的特征来预测高斯参数，导致几何构建不准确

Method: 提出C3-GS框架，集成三个轻量级模块到统一渲染流水线中，包含上下文感知、跨维度和跨尺度约束，改善特征融合

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS达到了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现照片级真实感合成，无需额外监督，代码已开源

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM是一个新颖的零样本3D视觉定位框架，通过多视角真实场景图像和空间信息进行目标物体推理，在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有零样本3D视觉定位方法因依赖单视角定位而导致的空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，推动3DVG向更好的泛化能力和实际应用性发展。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架通过多视角空间推理和动态调度机制，显著提升了零样本3D视觉定位的性能，推动了该技术向实际应用的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

TL;DR: 研究了CLIP视觉语言模型在军事车辆识别中对遮挡的鲁棒性，发现Transformer架构优于CNN，分散遮挡比连续遮挡影响更大，通过微调可显著提升抗遮挡能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在军事应用中具有零样本分类优势，但其在遮挡和低信噪比等挑战性军事环境中的鲁棒性尚未充分研究

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，评估不同CLIP变体在不同遮挡比例下的性能，采用NAUC指标，比较Transformer和CNN架构，分析线性探测和骨干网络微调的效果

Result: 1) Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN模型；2) 细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；3) 线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能急剧下降；4) 微调骨干网络后性能下降延迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定的数据增强，并进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在现实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解主要关注具体可见内容（物体、动作、事件等），但人类还能识别抽象概念（如正义、自由、团结）。抽象概念识别是视频理解的关键开放挑战，需要基于上下文信息进行多层次的语义推理。

Method: 通过综述研究，分析不同任务和数据集，借鉴数十年的社区经验，利用多模态基础模型的能力来重新审视抽象概念理解问题。

Result: 研究发现研究者们长期以来都在尝试解决这些任务，并充分利用当时可用的工具。基础模型的进步为解决视频抽象概念理解提供了理想条件。

Conclusion: 借鉴社区经验有助于避免"重复发明轮子"，为基础模型时代重新审视这一重要开放挑战提供指导，使模型更符合人类推理和价值观。

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Result: 在ISIC数据集上使用MobileNetV2和Vision Transformers进行评估

Conclusion: 该方法通过统一可视化诊断过程，减少误诊风险，提高诊断可靠性和患者安全性

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了扩散分类器在组合泛化能力方面是否优于判别式模型（如CLIP和ViLT），特别是在对象属性绑定和关系推理任务上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的核心是能够从已知部分组合出新含义，但现有的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在处理组合语义时表现不佳，容易出现错误绑定。扩散模型在生成任务中表现出色，但其在组合泛化方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习（ZSL）和广义零样本学习（GZSL）设置下的表现，重点关注对象属性绑定和关系推理任务。通过分析CLIP嵌入来探究模型在关系概念表示上的问题。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都遇到显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明，关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似可能是导致困难的原因。

Conclusion: 虽然扩散分类器在组合泛化方面有一定优势，但所有视觉语言模型在关系推理方面都面临重大挑战，需要进一步改进关系概念的表示学习。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的模块化框架通过显式解耦因果推理和答案生成，使用自然语言因果链作为中间表示，实现了更透明、逻辑一致的因果推理，为视频问答提供了新的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Conclusion: 所提出的surfel-based pose learning regression方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向性和不确定性问题，具有更好的鲁棒性和性能表现。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

TL;DR: FusionCounting是一个新颖的多任务学习框架，将人群计数与可见光和红外图像融合(VIF)相结合，通过动态损失权重和对抗训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架，将人群计数集成到VIF过程中，利用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛，并加入对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提高了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了密集场景中的VIF和人群计数问题，通过多任务设计和对抗训练实现了性能提升。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉语言模型(VLMs)和LoRA微调技术的外科手术工具2D关键点估计新方法，在低资源场景下仅需2个epoch微调即可超越基线模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer方法在小规模医疗数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用预训练VLMs的泛化能力来解决这个问题

Method: 使用LoRA技术微调预训练VLMs，精心设计提示词创建指令调优数据集，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐

Result: 仅需2个epoch微调，适应后的VLM在性能上就超越了基线模型，证明了LoRA在低资源场景的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了关键点检测性能，还为未来3D外科手术手和工具姿态估计研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了PointDGRWKV框架，首次将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域的域适应性问题，通过两个关键模块解决了空间扭曲和波动问题，在多个标准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将RWKV架构应用于点云分类域适应问题，通过两个创新模块有效解决了空间扭曲和波动挑战，为该领域提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Motivation: 解决深度学习病理诊断中模型决策不透明、缺乏可追溯依据的问题，提高AI辅助病理诊断的可信度和临床采纳率。

Method: 提出PathMR框架，基于病理图像和文本查询，同时生成专家级诊断解释和预测细胞分布模式，在多模态视觉推理架构基础上实现细胞级分析。

Conclusion: PathMR显著提升了AI驱动病理诊断的可解释性，具有重要的临床应用潜力，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will
be publicly available in https://github.com/zhangye-zoe/PathMR.

Conclusion: 建立了自动化PDAC检测的强大流程，可增强病理学家能力，并为扩展到其他癌症类型提供基础，对有限规模医学影像数据集应用深度学习提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反事实推理已成为可解释和公平AI的核心方法，但需要系统化框架来发现虚假相关性、探索因果依赖关系，并构建更鲁棒的系统。

Method: 开发了多个框架：CAVLI结合归因和概念分析；ASAC使用对抗性反事实扰动；TIBET提供可扩展的偏见评估流程；BiasConnect构建因果图；InterMit提供训练免费的偏见缓解算法。

Result: 这些方法能够量化模型对可解释概念的依赖程度，提高模型公平性和准确性，实现可扩展的社会责任偏见评估和缓解。

Conclusion: 反事实推理为判别性和生成性模型中的可解释性、公平性和因果性提供了统一视角，建立了原则性、可扩展的方法体系。

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Conclusion: 利用通用基础模型的优越密集预训练特征，为提升医学图像分割准确性提供了一种高效且参数效率高的方法。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble

refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Motivation: 现有视频加速方法存在根本性限制：既不建模视频帧的时间连贯性，也无法为大规模视频模型提供单步蒸馏，导致采样效率低下。

Method: 采用两阶段蒸馏过程：1）稳定性预热机制稳定对抗蒸馏；2）统一对抗均衡机制在高斯噪声空间中实现稳定的单步对抗训练；3）条件对抗一致性方法提升条件视频生成的语义和帧一致性。

Result: 在VBench-I2V上平均提升7.15%的语义对齐、时间一致性和帧质量，将预训练模型的延迟从1000秒降低到10秒（100倍加速）。

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型采样效率低下的问题，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算延迟。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Conclusion: 通过跨提示词共享计算的方法为扩散模型效率优化提供了新方向，在保持甚至提升质量的同时大幅降低计算需求，具有很好的实用性和扩展性

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学图像中的有丝分裂检测对肿瘤评估至关重要，但机器学习算法在跨域评估时会出现显著的性能下降，需要开发具有更好域泛化能力的方法。

Method: 采用Mamba架构的VM-UNet网络，结合染色增强操作来提高模型对域偏移的鲁棒性，该方法已提交至MIDOG挑战赛第一赛道。

Result: 在MIDOG++数据集上的初步实验显示，所提出的方法仍有很大的改进空间。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的VM-UNet架构结合染色增强技术为解决有丝分裂检测的域泛化问题提供了一个有前景的方向，但需要进一步优化以提升性能。

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FW-GAN是一个基于频率感知的单样本手写合成框架，通过Wave-MLP和频率引导判别器生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，解决了传统方法在长距离依赖和频率信息建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标记手写数据稀缺限制了识别系统的效果，现有合成方法存在两个主要问题：传统卷积架构难以建模长距离依赖和复杂笔画模式，且忽视了频率信息在捕捉细粒度风格细节中的关键作用。

Method: 提出FW-GAN框架，包含相位感知Wave-MLP生成器来捕捉空间关系并保留风格线索，频率引导判别器利用高频成分增强真实性检测，以及新颖的频率分布损失来对齐合成与真实手写的频率特征。

Result: 在越南语和英语手写数据集上的实验表明，FW-GAN能够生成高质量、风格一致的手写文本，成为低资源手写识别流水线中有价值的数据增强工具。

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过有效整合频率信息，显著提升了手写合成的真实性和风格一致性，为手写识别系统的数据增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视频token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际收益在段级和token级去除冗余，减少75%视觉token同时保持99.5%性能，预填充阶段加速3.9倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，且现有方法未考虑视频帧的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）基于帧相似性分割视频并动态分配token预算；2）使用时序引导的DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 在LLaVA-OneVision-7B上保持99.5%原始性能，减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍

Conclusion: MMG-Vid通过最大化有限token预算的利用率，在显著提升效率的同时保持了强大的性能表现

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源同质化且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake分层泛化测试数据集，提出基于MLLM的Veritas检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）和两阶段训练流程

Result: 传统检测器在跨模型场景中表现良好，但在未见伪造技术和数据域上表现不足；Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升，并能提供透明可信的检测输出

Conclusion: HydraFake数据集和Veritas检测器有效解决了深度伪造检测在真实世界中的泛化挑战，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Motivation: 解决单目跟踪器深度歧义和遮挡问题，以及现有多摄像头方法需要太多摄像头和流程复杂的限制

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿态和深度信息，将多视图特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器类更新机制来预测3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到中位轨迹误差3.1cm和2.0cm，支持1-8个摄像头不同视角和24-150帧视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D跟踪研究设定了新标准，提供了实用的实际应用工具，并开源了跟踪器和数据集

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务生成方法通常需要针对每个任务进行特定的监督微调(SFT)，这限制了模型的泛化能力和训练效率。不同任务虽然共享相似的调节范式，但在数据分布和评估指标上差异很大。

Method: 提出OneReward框架，使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，能够为不同任务和评估标准区分优劣结果。基于此开发Seedream 3.0 Fill模型，通过多任务强化学习直接在预训练基模型上训练，无需任务特定的SFT。

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，包括Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]。

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为统一的多任务生成模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

bottoms, and one-piece garments, as well as simultaneous tops and bottoms
try-on in a single pass. Key to our framework is CondNet, a novel conditioning

trained on heterogeneous training data, combining limited video data and a
larger, more readily available image dataset, in a multistage progressive

Motivation: 测试现有水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，推动更强大的图像水印方法发展

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB空间颜色对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过图像聚类、扩散模型和ChatGPT生成语义先验进行攻击

Result: 实现了接近完美的水印移除效果（95.7%），对剩余图像质量影响极小

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激发更鲁棒的水印方法开发

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了LLM在材料设计中的ICL能力

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: 简单的可学习频率滤波器是提升Transformer长时序预测性能的有效方法，既能提高性能又能减小模型规模

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Method: 提出概率模型框架，将transformer的下一token预测视为条件度量的非线性组合，将层操作建模为定点更新过程，并在隐马尔可夫模型特例中推导显式更新公式。

Result: 建立了transformer与条件概率度量之间的数学联系，为隐马尔可夫模型提供了具体的定点更新表达式，成功连接了经典滤波理论与现代神经网络架构。

Conclusion: 该工作为理解transformer的内部机制提供了新的概率视角，将现代深度学习架构与传统的非线性滤波理论相融合，具有重要的理论意义和解释价值。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Motivation: 当前自主实验主要关注预定义目标的优化，限制了意外或未知物理现象的发现，需要新的方法来增强科学发现的深度

Method: 集成两个关键组件：1)评估实验结果独特性的新颖性评分系统；2)促进探索未充分采样区域的战略采样机制，即使这些区域按传统标准看起来不太有前景

Conclusion: 该方法展示了自主实验增强科学发现深度的潜力，结合自主实验的效率，有望通过同时导航复杂实验空间来加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Conclusion: VC度量为神经网络逼近提供了重要的局部性能分析工具，基于VC的预处理框架能够加速神经网络逼近过程，提高其在关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这个过程需要手动调优且效率低下。

Method: Beacon算法直接使用固定的非缩放字母表进行逐通道PTQ，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子，支持对称和非对称量化，不依赖反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: Beacon为高效模型部署提供了一个实用的解决方案，消除了手动调优的需要，同时保持了良好的量化性能。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Motivation: 现实世界强化学习需要适应未见环境条件而不需要昂贵重训练。现有cMDP方法通常需要显式上下文变量，限制了在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用。

Method: 训练自监督编码器预测前向动力学，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。理论证明该编码器对高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要。

Result: 在挑战性cMDP基准测试中，DALI显著优于上下文无关基线，在推断任务中经常超越上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化到未见上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性，扰动重力编码维度会以物理合理方式改变想象推演，为处理潜在上下文提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Conclusion: FedReFT通过表示级微调和创新的聚合策略，为联邦学习中的异构挑战提供了有效的解决方案，实现了高效且个性化的模型适配。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够经验性地确定任务对齐和协作模式之间的最优融合比例，具有重要的实践意义

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，支持无监督和有监督应用，显著提高了优化求解的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our

### [189] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI)的投毒攻击方法，通过利用LLMs的对齐机制，在特定话题上触发拒绝回答，从而植入偏见或实施针对性审查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害或危险提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可以利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施审查。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在预定义话题上拒绝回答，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒就能在ChatDoctor等应用中导致对特定种族医疗问题的高偏见（ΔDP 23%），在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见，在其他9个聊天应用中偏见高达38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效规避现有的投毒检测防御机制，揭示了LLMs对齐机制可能被滥用于植入偏见和审查的实际风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究建立了一个开放的地理广告推广模拟器，比较了合成控制法（SCM）咄双重机器学习（DML）在两边市场中的效果估计性能，发现DML方法在复杂场景下更为稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确量化地理层面的市场营销效果在两边市场中面临挑战：SCM方法强劲但系统性低估效果大小，而DML方法缺乏与SCM的直接比较。

Method: 建立了一个完全文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试。通过五种历练测试来检验七种估计器：三种ASC变体咄四种面板DML方法，每个场景重复100次。

Result: ASC模型在复杂场景（非线性或外部冲击）中显示出严重偏差咄近零的覆盖率。相比之下，面板DML方法显著减少了偏差并恢复了标准95%置信区间覆盖率，更加稳健。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架：先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择适合该场景的特定DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的方案。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分割方法，用于EEG信号预处理，相比固定长度分割能提高癫痫检测性能且需要更少的数据段


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG机器学习使用固定时间片段分割信号，但大脑状态并不局限于固定时间间隔，这种固定分割方法可能缺乏生物学相关性

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长片段，并使用CTXGEN信号生成器生成可控合成数据进行评估，在癫痫检测问题上验证方法有效性

Result: 使用CTXSEG预处理EEG数据相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，在标准化评估框架下表现更好，且需要更少的数据段

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割方法可轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力改善性能，是EEG机器学习应用中信号预处理的有前景的替代方案

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

TL;DR: 该论文通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程，获得了对称矩阵分解问题的闭式解，定量分析了梯度流在小初始化下的增量学习现象，揭示了不同目标矩阵分量学习动态之间的时间尺度分离机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多理论研究将神经网络的优异性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下训练网络时产生的隐式偏置或正则化。本文旨在定量理解梯度流在过参数化矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为。

Method: 使用对称矩阵分解问题的闭式解（通过求解Riccati类矩阵微分方程获得），分析梯度流在小初始化下的动态行为，研究不同分量学习过程的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 研究发现增量学习现象源于学习目标矩阵不同分量动态之间的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这些时间尺度分离更加明显，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的增量学习行为提供了定量框架，并讨论了将此类分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

TL;DR: DFAMS是一个基于动态信息流的新型联邦检索框架，通过分析LLM中的梯度信号来识别潜在查询意图，并在异构知识源间构建语义对齐的分区，显著提升了模糊查询的检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时效果不佳，特别是在跨域场景中难以检索到高质量相关文档，限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用动态信息流(DIF)技术，通过少量标注查询的梯度信号和基于Shapley值的归因分析来追踪神经元激活路径，识别查询意图和子域边界，然后通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块实现细粒度语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上比先进方法提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流技术有效解决了联邦检索中的模糊查询问题，在复杂检索场景中表现出色，为跨域知识检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Motivation: 解决设计师在评估引擎盖框架几何性能时需要大量时间进行模拟设置的问题，提高工程设计流程的效率。

Method: 提出多模态机器学习(MMML)架构，从同一数据的不同模态中学习来预测性能指标，使用未包含在训练数据集中的新框架几何进行预测验证。

Result: MMML架构在性能预测方面优于传统单模态方法，能够泛化到未见过的框架模型，展示了在实际工程应用中的潜力。

Conclusion: MMML有潜力补充传统的基于模拟的工作流程，特别是在概念设计阶段，为机器学习在工程设计中的更广泛应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Motivation: ECG信号作为心脏数字孪生的基础数据源，经常受到噪声和伪影的影响，降低了其诊断价值，需要开发有效的去噪方法来保持信号的诊断完整性。

Method: 提出TF-TransUNet1D一维深度神经网络，整合U-Net编码器-解码器架构和Transformer编码器，采用时频域混合损失函数，同时优化时间域波形重建和频域谱保真度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提供高精度去噪，填补了心脏数字孪生预处理流程的关键空白，实现了更可靠的实时监测和个性化建模。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Motivation: Transformer的自注意力机制存在二次复杂度瓶颈，限制了在长序列任务中的应用。现有线性注意力方法通常需要牺牲模型性能，依赖于数据无关的核近似或受限的上下文选择

Method: 从连接主义的第一性原理出发，基于信息流的拓扑结构重新配置神经元连接模式，构建TLinFormer架构，实现严格线性复杂度并计算精确注意力分数

Result: 在长序列推理任务中，TLinFormer在推理延迟、KV缓存效率、内存占用和整体加速等关键指标上表现出压倒性优势

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功解决了传统Transformer的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时实现了线性复杂度，为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了学习型方法的高效性和采样规划器的安全性保证，为复杂动力学系统提供了既快速又安全的运动规划解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

TL;DR: 该研究结合传统可解释AI和评级驱动解释方法，评估了四种时间序列预测模型在不同领域的性能与可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动大或稀疏领域表现更好且更易解释，而基础模型仅在稳定趋势驱动场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中存在成功或失败原因不明确的问题，且这些模型的输出对现实世界决策有重要影响，需要理解其复杂性、性能变异性和不透明性，以解决用户如何与模型输出交互和依赖的严重关切。

Method: 结合传统可解释AI(XAI)方法和评级驱动解释(RDE)，评估了四种模型架构(ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos时间序列基础模型、Llama通用基础模型)在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售四个异质数据集上的表现。

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动大或稀疏领域(如电力、汽车零部件)持续优于基础模型(如Chronos)且提供更可解释的解释，而基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动场景(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了根据具体应用场景选择合适模型的重要性，特征工程模型在复杂多变环境中具有优势，而基础模型更适合稳定趋势预测，为时间序列预测模型的实际应用提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似度测量和ICL生成的代理约束，解决了现有遗忘方法中遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精准的数据遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄露风险）或过度遗忘（牺牲模型效用）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）基于嵌入空间相似度的纠缠感知损失重加权，确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上 consistently 改善了遗忘-效用权衡，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，可作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了当前方法的局限性，指出了需要更先进的隐私保护数据共享方法，并为在现实场景中评估这些方法设立了先例

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Method: 提出Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT)框架：1) 使用超图结构编码器捕获医疗代码间的高阶交互；2) 集成Transformer架构对整个超图进行推理；3) 设计包含超图重建的定制损失函数以保持原始结构

Result: 在真实世界EHR数据集上的实验表明，SHGT在诊断预测任务上优于现有的最先进模型

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过结合超图结构和Transformer架构，有效解决了现有GNN方法在医疗代码建模中的局限性，提升了诊断预测性能

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

TL;DR: MedGR²是一个创新的医疗视觉语言模型框架，通过生成式奖励学习创建自我改进的数据生成和奖励模型循环，解决了医疗领域高质量标注数据稀缺的问题，显著提升了跨模态和跨任务的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受到高质量专家标注数据稀缺的限制，传统监督微调泛化能力差，而强化学习缺乏可靠的奖励信号。需要突破数据稀缺的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习。

Result: 使用MedGR²生成数据的监督微调已超越基于大规模人工标注数据集的基线方法。结合GRPO的强化学习实现了最先进的跨模态和跨任务泛化，性能优于专门的RL方法，紧凑模型性能可与参数量10倍以上的基础模型竞争。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的数据高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT优化器通过最大范数和逐元素信任比解决大批次训练中的注意力层信息瓶颈问题，在GPT-2模型上实现了6k批次大小无性能下降的训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次语言模型训练中存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力对数急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束查询/键权重的最大值。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器：1）使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力对数；2）构建逐元素信任比，通过关注局部权重结构提供更鲁棒的更新缩放。

Result: 在各种规模的GPT-2模型上进行的大批次训练实验显示MERIT具有优越性能。在GPT-2 Medium训练中，MERIT实现了6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）且48B训练token下无任何性能下降。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力对数和更细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为更大批次使用铺平了道路，能够加速大型语言模型的开发和迭代。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高斯过程随机超参数学习方法依赖于近似计算（如偏置随机梯度或随机变分推断中的诱导点），无法保证收敛到真实边缘似然的驻点

Method: 针对具有中等有限维RKHS核的高斯过程，提出精确随机推断算法；对于无限维RKHS，方法可扩展但需牺牲精确性

Result: 在内存资源限制批次大小和诱导点数量的情况下，无论是有限维还是无限维RKHS，该方法都取得了比现有方法更好的实验结果

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了更可靠的推断框架，特别是在计算资源受限的场景下表现优异

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在处理长距离依赖关系任务时遇到过压缩问题，当从广泛邻域收集信息并压缩到固定大小的节点表征时会产生瓶颈。传统的图重新线路和添加虚拟节点方法会改变全局拓扑结构并破坏原始图结构中编码的领域知识。

Method: 提出局部虚拟节点(LVN)方法，根据节点中心性指标确定潜在瓶颈区域，在这些区域添加具有可训练嵌入的虚拟节点。LVN在选定的中央区域之间共享嵌入，从而在不增加更多层数的情况下促进远程节点之间的通信。

Result: 在标准数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，LVN能够提高结构连通性，并在图分类和节点分类任务上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: LVN方法能够有效缓解图神经网络训练中的过压缩问题，同时保持输入图的全局结构不受显著影响，为处理长距离依赖关系的图学习任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Method: 提出模型特异性距离度量来量化可信度，设计了在回归模型上验证调查数据可信性的算法，样本复杂度与数据维度无关。

Result: 算法的样本复杂度与数据维度无关，而如果通过重构回归模型来验证可信性，样本复杂度会随维度线性增长。理论正确性得到证明，数值实验展示了算法性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重点验证调查数据的可信性而非重构模型，实现了高效的样本利用，为样本调查的评估提供了新的视角和技术手段。

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

Motivation: 超声信号在工业无损检测和结构健康监测中至关重要，但标注数据稀缺且信号处理任务特定。MAE在计算机视觉等领域已证明有效，但在1D超声信号分析中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用MAE在无标签合成超声信号上进行预训练，系统研究模型大小、补丁大小和掩码比例对预训练效率和下游准确性的影响，并与从头训练的模型和优化的CNN基线进行比较。

Result: 预训练模型显著优于从头训练的模型和针对下游任务优化的CNN基线，且在合成数据上预训练相比仅在有限真实数据上训练，对真实测量信号表现出更好的迁移能力。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了MAE通过可扩展的自监督学习推动超声信号分析的潜力，为工业应用中的信号处理提供了有效的预训练策略。

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理多模态信息和工具调用方面表现出色，但在处理大规模图结构数据时仍然存在困难，需要专门的图算法工具来增强其推理能力。

Method: 开发了GDS代理，提供了一套完整的图算法工具集，包括预处理（检索）和算法结果后处理，集成在模型上下文协议（MCP）服务器中，可与任何现代LLM即插即用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

TL;DR: 提出TV-HSGT算法，一种基于混合随机梯度跟踪和方差缩减机制的时间变化混合随机梯度跟踪算法，用于动态有向网络中的分布式在线优化，无需梯度有界假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和动态性增加，分布式在线优化对实时决策至关重要。现有算法依赖梯度有界假设且忽视随机梯度影响，特别是在时变有向网络中。

Method: TV-HSGT结合行随机和列随机通信方案，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息。通过组合当前和递归随机梯度来减少梯度方差并准确跟踪全局下降方向。

Result: 理论分析显示TV-HSGT能在不假设梯度有界的情况下实现改进的动态遗憾界限。逻辑回归任务的实验结果证实了其在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了有效的解决方案，突破了传统算法的限制，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计解决了现有扩散蒸馏方法的偏差问题，显著提升了一步蒸馏的性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

Conclusion: 这项研究证明了临床时间序列具有组合性结构，通过推断潜在生理状态的系统性迅序可以生成高质量的合成数据。这种组合性数据生成方法能够有效缓解临床数据稀缩问题，为临床预测任务提供了更好的数据支持，并深化了我们对临床数据生成机制的理解。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，恶意微调风险增加。现有研究主要关注监督微调(SFT)的危害，但研究发现强化学习(RL)微调能更有效地破坏安全对齐，需要专门防御

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御方法，通过抑制模型响应不确定性来对抗RL微调。采用熵作为奖励的RL和Token Noiser机制，防止有害能力升级

Result: 跨多个模型和RL算法的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力

Conclusion: RL有害微调比SFT具有更大系统性风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

TL;DR: EEGDM是一种基于潜在扩散模型的自监督EEG表示学习方法，通过EEG信号生成作为自监督目标，能够学习到具有良好泛化能力的EEG表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EEG表示学习方法（如EEGPT和LaBraM）通常依赖简单的掩码重建目标，可能无法充分捕捉EEG信号中丰富的语义信息和复杂模式，特别是在训练数据有限时泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出EEGDM方法，包含一个EEG编码器将EEG信号及其通道增强压缩为紧凑表示，作为条件信息指导扩散模型生成EEG信号，从而构建紧凑的潜在空间。

Conclusion: EEGDM通过扩散模型实现了强大的EEG表示学习能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用价值，特别是在数据有限的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: 工具增强工作流不仅具有实用性，而且在理论上被证明更具可扩展性，教授工具使用和通用规则比微调记忆事实更有效

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基于transformer架构在可扩展、高性能自动特征变换方面的潜力。

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: ATM-GAD通过有效利用时间motif和自适应时间窗口，成功捕捉了金融欺诈的关键时间特征，为金融异常检测提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj数据集和相关开源工具LeMaterial-Fetcher为社区提供了可复现的框架，便于整合新数据源并确保大规模材料数据集的持续发展。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的示例；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过基于似然的损失学习SMI函数参数；3) 使用合成释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在9个基准数据集上验证了方法的有效性，显示出显著性能提升

Conclusion: InSQuAD通过同时关注质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，为ICL示例选择提供了新思路

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了RLG方法，通过几何平均结合基础模型和RL微调模型的输出，在推理时动态控制扩散模型的对齐强度，无需额外训练即可调节对齐-质量权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL微调方法在扩散模型中效果不佳，且微调后难以灵活控制对齐强度，需要一种能够在推理时动态调节对齐程度的方法。

Method: 重新解释扩散模型的RL微调，通过随机微分方程和隐式奖励条件化的视角，将分类器自由引导(CFG)适配为强化学习引导(RLG)，使用几何平均结合基础模型和RL微调模型的输出。

Result: RLG在各种架构、RL算法和下游任务中持续提升RL微调模型的性能，包括人类偏好、组合控制、可压缩性和文本渲染，支持插值和外推，提供前所未有的对齐控制灵活性。

Conclusion: RLG为在推理时增强和控制扩散模型对齐提供了一个实用且理论完备的解决方案，实现了动态的对齐-质量权衡控制。

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了子采样自然梯度下降(SNGD)及其加速变体SPRING在参数优化中的收敛性，证明了在最小二乘损失下SNGD等价于正则化Kaczmarz方法，SPRING等价于加速正则化Kaczmarz方法，首次获得了SNGD的快速收敛率和SPRING的收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 子采样自然梯度下降在科学机器学习中表现出色，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在填补这一空白，为SNGD及其加速变体SPRING提供理论分析基础。

Method: 通过分析理想化的参数优化问题（模型线性、损失函数强凸二次型），在最小二乘损失情况下证明SNGD与正则化Kaczmarz方法的等价性，并利用现有分析工具推导收敛性。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，并证明了SPRING能够加速SNGD。在一般强凸二次损失情况下，也获得了SNGD的快速收敛率。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用，为SNGD在最小二乘设置之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

TL;DR: LoTUS是一种新的机器学习遗忘方法，通过平滑模型预测概率来消除训练样本的影响，避免从头重新训练，在效率和效果上都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习遗忘方法需要重新训练模型，这在大型数据集上不切实际。LoTUS旨在避免重新训练，同时有效消除特定训练样本对预训练模型的影响。

Method: LoTUS通过平滑模型的预测概率达到信息理论边界，减轻因数据记忆导致的模型过度自信问题。该方法还引入了新的评估指标RF-JSD。

Result: 在Transformer和ResNet18模型上，LoTUS在五个公共数据集上优于八个基线方法，特别是在ImageNet1k等大规模数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种高效有效的机器学习遗忘解决方案，特别适用于大规模数据集和实际应用场景，避免了重新训练的高成本。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式代理模型在物流供应链管理研究中作为人类行为代理的有效性，因为LLM能天然语言推理生成人类化响应，但其作为人类行为代理的有效性不明

Method: 通过控制实验测试6种最新LLM与957名人类参与者（477对二元组）在外卖配送场景中的客户-工作人员交互，采用调节中介设计和等效性测试

Result: 研究发现GABM能有效模拟LSCM中的人类行为，但存在等效性-过程矛盾：虽然部分LLM通过TOST等效性测试显示表面级别等效，但SEM分析发现某些LLM存在人类没有的人工决策过程

Conclusion: 通过合适的验证检查，GABM可作为LSCM研究的可行方法式工具，研究提出双重验证框架（人类等效性测试和决策过程验证）以确保GABM发展的严谨性

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs)
offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management
(LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors.
Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses
through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new
perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as
proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates
LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining
dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six
state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a
moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two
levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation.
Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however,
an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided
Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level
equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial
decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These
findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM
with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM
researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this
study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过将有限边际线性二次(LQ)游戏的纳绍坎衡解重新解释为非线性动力系统，揭示了有限边际和无限边际LQ游戏坎衡解之间的关系，并发现了周期性纳绍坎衡解和三种近似治济模式。


<details>

Motivation: 研究有限边际线性二次游戏的纳绍坎衡解与无限边际情况下的多重坎衡解之间的关系，以提供通过有限边际游戏调整无限边际游戏的新视角和工具。

Method: 将有限边际LQ游戏的纳绍坎衡解重新解释为非线性动力系统，证明该系统的固定点就是无限边际坎衡解，并研究周期轨道对应的周期性纳绍坎衡解。

Result: 证明了通过适当选择终端成本可以恢复任何无限边际坎衡解，并通过数值模拟发现了三种近似治济：收敛到稳态坎衡解、收敛到周期坎衡解以及有界非收敛轨道。

Conclusion: 这些发现为使用无限边际LQ游戏来调整有限边际LQ游戏提供了新的见解和工具，并揭示了纳绍坎衡解的复杂动态行为。

Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium,
while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship
between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a
nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed
points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such
equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We
further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise,
correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of
convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic
regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic
equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new
insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.

TL;DR: 通过游戏理论模型研究说明，积极偏见的理解策略在进化中更具适应性，这解释了为什么人类行为常偏离理性判断


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类行为为什么会偏离游戏理论预测，探索理解能力与认知偏见的共同进化机制

Method: 使用进化游戏论模型，在增量千足虫游戏中模拟中性和偏见的level-k理解策略，分析正负偏见的适应性

Result: 选择优先支持积极偏见理解，理性行为甚至绝迹；偏见与有限理性共同进化，积极偏见者与非理解者可共存；更长游戏促进积极偏见

Conclusion: 某些认知偏见尽管偏离理性判断，但实际上是一种适应性特征，能够帮助更好应对社会困境

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that human behaviour often deviates from
game-theoretical rationality. For instance, humans may hold unrealistic
expectations about future outcomes. As the evolutionary roots of such biases
remain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive
biases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a
population deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies
to anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the
Incremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a
systematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while
negatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that
selection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational
behaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as
the reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,
positively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing
to a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased
reasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning
strategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful
thinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that
certain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute
an adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.

TL;DR: MM-HSD是一个用于视频仇恨言论检测的多模态模型，整合了视频帧、音频、语音转录文本和屏幕文本，通过跨模态注意力机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态仇恨言论检测方法在视频中应用有限，简单融合方法无法充分捕捉模态间依赖关系，且往往忽略了屏幕文本和音频等重要模态。

Method: 提出MM-HSD模型，使用跨模态注意力(CMA)作为早期特征提取器，整合视频帧、音频、语音转录文本和屏幕文本，系统比较查询/键配置并评估不同模态在CMA块中的交互作用。

Result: 在HateMM数据集上，MM-HSD在M-F1分数上达到0.874，优于现有最先进方法，特别是在使用屏幕文本作为查询、其他模态作为键时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该研究表明跨模态注意力机制能有效提升视频仇恨言论检测性能，屏幕文本作为查询模态与其他模态的组合提供了重要线索。

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,
existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As
modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail
to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits
relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle
hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in
combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model
for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from
speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features
extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an
early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key
configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities
in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen
text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.
Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,
on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the
modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/idiap/mm-hsd

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统在竞赛中表现下降，主要原因是围绕核心交互式自组织特征图添加新功能导致复杂性增加，需要重新设计来提升性能。

Method: 完全从零开始重建系统，采用模块化架构，保留经过验证的有用功能，大幅降低系统复杂度。

Result: 开发了diveXplore 5.0版本，这是为VBS 2021竞赛准备的全新重构系统。

Conclusion: 通过完全重构和模块化设计，成功解决了系统复杂性导致性能下降的问题，为未来的功能扩展提供了更好的架构基础。

Abstract: As a longstanding participating system in the annual Video Browser Showdown
(VBS2017-VBS2020) as well as in two iterations of the more recently established
Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC2018-LSC2019), diveXplore is developed as a
feature-rich Deep Interactive Video Exploration system. After its initial
successful employment as a competitive tool at the challenges, its performance,
however, declined as new features were introduced increasing its overall
complexity. We mainly attribute this to the fact that many additions to the
system needed to revolve around the system's core element - an interactive
self-organizing browseable featuremap, which, as an integral component did not
accommodate the addition of new features well. Therefore, counteracting said
performance decline, the VBS 2021 version constitutes a completely rebuilt
version 5.0, implemented from scratch with the aim of greatly reducing the
system's complexity as well as keeping proven useful features in a modular
manner.

Result: 重构后的系统在VBS2021竞赛中表现出性能提升，相比之前的竞赛版本有更好的表现。

Conclusion: 系统重构和功能精简是明智的决策，新版本在保持竞争力的同时提供了更优的性能和用户体验，为未来的视频检索技术发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Continuously participating since the sixth Video Browser Showdown (VBS2017),
diveXplore is a veteran interactive search system that throughout its lifetime
has offered and evaluated numerous features. After undergoing major refactoring
for the most recent VBS2021, however, the system since version 5.0 is less
feature rich, yet, more modern, leaner and faster than the original system.
This proved to be a sensible decision as the new system showed increasing
performance in VBS2021 when compared to the most recent former competitions.
With version 6.0 we reconsider shot segmentation, map search and introduce new
features for improving concept as well as temporal context search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态点云压缩在自动驾驶和AR/VR中至关重要，但现有方法在复杂度管理和码率控制方面面临挑战。需要一种能够支持可变码率和计算复杂度的编码框架来满足实时和码率约束场景的需求。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法平均BD-Rate降低5.81%，BD-PSNR提高0.42 dB，平均码率误差仅为0.40%。与D-DPCC相比，平均编码时间减少44.6%，显示了在实时和码率约束场景下的高效性。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的可变码率和复杂度动态编码框架有效解决了现有方法在复杂度管理和码率控制方面的挑战，在性能和效率方面都实现了显著提升，为实时动态点云压缩应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic point cloud compression (DPCC) is crucial in applications like
autonomous driving and AR/VR. Current compression methods face challenges with
complexity management and rate control. This paper introduces a novel dynamic
coding framework that supports variable bitrate and computational complexities.
Our approach includes a slimmable framework with multiple coding routes,
allowing for efficient Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) within a
single model. To address data sparsity in inter-frame prediction, we propose
the coarse-to-fine motion estimation and compensation module that deconstructs
geometric information while expanding the perceptive field. Additionally, we
propose a precise rate control module that content-adaptively navigates point
cloud frames through various coding routes to meet target bitrates. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach reduces the average BD-Rate
by 5.81% and improves the BD-PSNR by 0.42 dB compared to the state-of-the-art
method, while keeping the average bitrate error at 0.40%. Moreover, the average
coding time is reduced by up to 44.6% compared to D-DPCC, underscoring its
efficiency in real-time and bitrate-constrained DPCC scenarios. Our code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种工具感知的实时碰撞避免系统，能够在动态环境中适应不同工具尺寸和交互模式，通过学习感知模型和约束强化学习控制策略，实现高效安全的机器人操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人控制器通常假设完全可见性和固定工具，这在动态环境中容易导致碰撞或过于保守的行为，需要开发能够实时适应工具变化和部分可观测性的碰撞避免系统。

Method: 使用学习感知模型从点云中过滤机器人和工具组件，推理遮挡区域，预测部分可观测下的碰撞风险，并通过约束强化学习训练控制策略生成平滑的避障动作。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境测试中优于传统方法（APF、MPPI），保持亚毫米级精度，计算成本比最先进的GPU规划器降低约60%，响应时间低于10毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的机器人操作提供了模块化、高效且有效的碰撞避免解决方案，已成功集成到协作机器人应用中，实现了安全响应操作。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment

temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous

*Kipp McAdam Freud,Yijiong Lin,Nathan F. Lepora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear是一个sim-to-real触觉控制管道，通过shPix2pix GAN将无剪切信息的模拟触觉图像转换为包含剪切变形的真实图像，成功应用于桌面机械臂的触觉跟踪和协作举升任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 剪切信息对动态物体交互任务至关重要，但在模拟中难以准确建模。现有方法无法有效处理剪切动力学，限制了sim-to-real触觉控制的应用。

Method: 提出shPixpix剪切条件U-Net GAN，将无剪切信息的模拟触觉图像与剪切编码向量结合，生成包含剪切变形的真实触觉图像。使用低成本桌面机械臂和视觉触觉传感器验证。

Result: 在触觉图像模拟和姿态/剪切预测方面优于基线pix2pix方法。在触觉跟踪和协作举升任务中，接触误差保持在1-2mm范围内，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SimShear证明了使用刚体模拟器进行sim-to-real剪切建模的可行性，为触觉机器人学的仿真开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段框架，结合XCoM/LIPM步态模板与轻量级残差规划器，使双足机器人能够可靠地通过0.2米宽的窄梁


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决双足机器人在窄梁上行走的挑战，包括稀疏的安全关键接触点和纯学习策略的脆弱性问题

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段在平地上训练跟踪器学习稳健跟随脚步目标；第二阶段在梁上训练高层规划器预测摆动脚的残差，优化模板步态以确保安全精确的落脚点

Result: 在Unitree G1机器人上成功通过0.2米宽、3米长的梁，在仿真和实际测试中残差优化方法在成功率、中线跟随和安全裕度方面均优于基准方法

Conclusion: 该结构化框架实现了透明的分析和低摩擦的仿真到现实迁移，为双足机器人在狭窄环境中的稳健行走提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: 该框架能够在实时高风险工业环境中有效确保空间精度和视觉保真度，为工业元宇宙中的人机交互提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

Abstract: Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the
development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a
survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task
allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement

problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep
RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating
autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is
envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a
comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to

emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future

Result: 在3自由度书法机器人上进行了系统评估

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实现专家技能向机器人的转移，解决了传统方法在任务灵活性方面的限制

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

Conclusion: CoCoL为多机器人系统提供了一种通信高效的协作学习解决方案，有效解决了通信开销和数据异构性问题，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: UA-PCBFs框架为人机协作提供了更智能、更安全且更流畅的交互方式，通过不确定性感知实现了安全性与灵活性的更好平衡。

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual

the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced

hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source

restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control
method and biomimicry mechanism to the field of flapping flight and robotics.

Conclusion: PEWM框架利用视频模型的时空视觉先验和VLM的语义感知能力，为可扩展、可解释和通用目的的具身智能铺平了道路。

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: GIT*通过充分利用环境数据和强化遗传编程，显著提升了高维路径规划的性能和实用性

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners

Result: 在Isaac Sim中的综合评估表明，GODHS相比传统非语义搜索策略具有更高的搜索效率

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将语言增强的语义推理与层次化导航相结合，为机器人在复杂非结构化环境中的物体搜索提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

*Curtis C. Johnson,Daniel Webb,David Hill,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种可扩展的触觉感知架构，通过硬件级利小信号干扰和新的SPI总线拓扑，实现了超过8,000个感应元的实时数据传输，在全身抓取任务中验证了其效果。

Result: 系统能够在1平方米感知面积上流式传输超过8,000个感应元的同步数据，更新率超过50FPS，适用于实时控制。在全身抓取任务中，实时触觉反馈让机器人从破坏性的开环控制转变为稳定的轻某抓取。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个健壮且特征化良好的平台，为高级全身控制和物理人机交互的未来研究打开了通路。

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

*Jiajie Li,Boyang Sun,Luca Di Giammarino,Hermann Blum,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActLoc是一个主动视角感知规划框架，通过大尺度训练的注意力模型选择最佳视角，提升机器人导航中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定位系统假设所有视角方向信息量相同，但实际上面对未映射、模糊或无信息区域时定位不可靠，需要主动选择信息丰富的视角。

Method: 使用基于注意力的大规模训练模型，编码度量地图和建图时的相机位姿，预测任意3D位置在不同偏航和俯仰角下的定位精度分布，并将这些精度信息整合到路径规划器中。

Result: 在单视角选择和完整轨迹规划方面达到最先进水平，能够有效泛化到不同的机器人导航和检测任务。

Conclusion: ActLoc的模块化设计使其易于应用于各种机器人导航任务，通过主动选择相机朝向显著提升了定位鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: UltraTac是一种新型集成传感器，通过同轴光声架构将视觉触觉成像与超声波传感相结合，实现了接近感知、材料分类和纹理-材料双模式物体识别功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉触觉传感器虽然能提供高分辨率触觉信息，但无法感知物体的材料特性，限制了其在机器人操作和人机交互中的应用。

Method: 采用同轴光声架构设计，共享结构组件并实现一致的传感区域。在传统视觉触觉传感器结构中融入声学匹配，集成超声波传感模式而不影响视觉触觉性能。通过触觉反馈动态调整超声波模块的工作状态。

Result: 实现了3-8cm范围内的接近感知（R²=0.90）、材料分类（平均准确率99.20%）以及纹理-材料双模式物体识别（15类任务准确率92.11%）。成功集成到机器人操作系统中，能够同时检测容器表面图案和内部内容。

Conclusion: UltraTac传感器展示了在高级人机交互和精确机器人操作中的潜力，为多模态传感提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

### [261] [Rapid Mismatch Estimation via Neural Network Informed Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21007)
*Mateusz Jaszczuk,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME) 是一个自适应、控制器无关的概率框架，用于在线估计末端执行器动力学失配，无需外部力扭矩传感器，能在约400毫秒内适应质量和质心的突然变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人在人机环境中的广泛应用，确保柔软安全的物理交互至关重要。虽然柔顺硬件可以促进这种交互，但阻抗控制器的有效性依赖于准确的动力学模型，任何模型失配都会导致任务失败和不安全行为。

Method: 提出RME框架，从机器人的本体感受反馈中，使用神经网络模型失配估计器生成变分推断求解器的先验，快速收敛到未知参数并量化不确定性。

Result: 在真实7自由度机械臂上，RME在静态和动态设置中约400毫秒内适应末端执行器质量和质心的突然变化。在协作场景中展示了对动态变化的快速安全适应。

Conclusion: RME框架能够在不依赖外部传感系统的情况下，快速安全地适应物理交互过程中的动态变化，提高了机器人在人机环境中的安全性和适应性。

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user
study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers
the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模拟到实际运行的转移问题（sim-to-real gap），现有方法要么在分布外条件下表现差，要么需要程序调整重训，成本高。

Method: 统一残差动力学习与实时攻略适应的在线适应性学习框架，嵌入可微模拟中支持梯度传播，实现样本高效的攻略更新。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在实时环境中快速适应未见干扰，提高攻略的稳健性和性能，为机器人控制提供了一种高效的在线适应方案。

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MoTAS框架通过TTS数据增强和MoE特征选择机制，在ADReSSo数据集上实现了85.71%的阿尔茨海默病筛查准确率，优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿尔茨海默病早期筛查中数据有限和缺乏细粒度自适应特征选择的问题，提高筛查效率和模型泛化能力。

Method: 使用自动语音识别获取转录文本，通过文本到语音技术进行数据增强，采用混合专家机制动态选择最优多模态特征进行融合分类。

Result: 在ADReSSo数据集上达到85.71%的准确率，消融实验验证了TTS增强和MoE机制各自对性能提升的贡献。

Conclusion: MoTAS在数据有限的实际场景中具有重要实用价值，为阿尔茨海默病的非侵入性筛查提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Early screening for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through speech presents a
promising non-invasive approach. However, challenges such as limited data and
the lack of fine-grained, adaptive feature selection often hinder performance.
To address these issues, we propose MoTAS, a robust framework designed to
enhance AD screening efficiency. MoTAS leverages Text-to-Speech (TTS)
augmentation to increase data volume and employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
mechanism to improve multimodal feature selection, jointly enhancing model
generalization. The process begins with automatic speech recognition (ASR) to
obtain accurate transcriptions. TTS is then used to synthesize speech that
enriches the dataset. After extracting acoustic and text embeddings, the MoE
mechanism dynamically selects the most informative features, optimizing feature
fusion for improved classification. Evaluated on the ADReSSo dataset, MoTAS
achieves a leading accuracy of 85.71\%, outperforming existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the individual contributions of TTS
augmentation and MoE in boosting classification performance. These findings
highlight the practical value of MoTAS in real-world AD screening scenarios,
particularly in data-limited settings.

*Mattias Cross,Anton Ragni*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 本文研究概率路径的直线性对语音增强质量的影响，比较了弯曲路径（Schrodinger桥）和直线路径（条件流匹配）方法，发现时间无关的直线路径能提升语音增强质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于流的生成式语音增强方法学习弯曲概率路径来建模干净和噪声语音之间的映射，但弯曲路径的影响未知。机器学习研究表明直线路径更易训练且泛化更好，因此需要量化路径直线性对语音增强质量的影响。

Method: 实验比较Schrodinger桥（弯曲路径）和条件流匹配（直线路径）方法，分析不同配置对路径直线性的影响，并提出独立条件流匹配方法建模噪声和干净语音间的直线路径。

Result: 时间无关方差比梯度对样本质量影响更大；条件流匹配改善了多个语音质量指标但需要多步推理；通过将训练好的流模型直接用于预测实现了一步推理解决方案。

Conclusion: 时间无关的直线概率路径比时间相关的弯曲路径能更好地改善生成式语音增强性能，直线路径提供了更好的训练和泛化特性。

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved
probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite
impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are
unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where
time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings
in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional
flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this
paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement
quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that
certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose
independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models
straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that
a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the
gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality
metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step
solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly
predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability
paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Amadeus是一个新颖的符号音乐生成框架，采用两层架构：自回归模型处理音符序列，双向离散扩散模型处理属性，在性能和速度上显著优于现有最优模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符号音乐生成模型假设音符属性之间存在固定的时间依赖关系，但研究发现不同属性作为初始token时性能相当，表明音符属性本质上是并发无序的集合而非时间依赖序列

Method: 提出Amadeus框架：音符序列使用自回归模型，属性使用双向离散扩散模型；引入MLSDES增强中间表示判别性，CIEM模块通过注意力机制增强音符潜在向量表示

Result: 在无条件和文本条件生成任务中，Amadeus在多个指标上显著优于SOTA模型，同时实现至少4倍加速；展示了无需训练即可进行细粒度音符属性控制的可行性

Conclusion: Amadeus框架通过重新思考音符属性的本质特性，实现了性能突破和效率提升，同时构建了最大的开源符号音乐数据集AMD来探索架构的性能上限

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly
adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling
symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal
dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure
among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as
the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This
suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent
and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this
insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.
Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note
sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To
enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement
Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify
discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional
Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent
vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note
decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and
text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA
models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up.
Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control
feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the
Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset
to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and
fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有的语音健康评估方法通常只关注单一病症，未能充分利用语音中丰富的多维度信息，且需要传输原始音频存在隐私风险。

Method: 采用双分支架构，包含专门编码器和任务特定头部，共享共同的声学骨干网络，实现跨病症知识迁移，仅使用派生声学特征无需原始音频传输。

Result: 在Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0数据集上总体AUROC达到0.78，神经疾病检测表现优异（AUROC=0.89），阿尔茨海默病/轻度认知障碍检测AUROC高达0.97，比单模态基线提升5-19%，在9个任务中的7个超越最先进的自监督模型。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了单一统一模型能有效筛查多种疾病，为资源受限和远程医疗环境中的可部署语音诊断系统奠定了基础，且模型内部表征与临床认可的声学模式一致。

Abstract: Voice-based health assessment offers unprecedented opportunities for
scalable, non-invasive disease screening, yet existing approaches typically
focus on single conditions and fail to leverage the rich, multi-faceted
information embedded in speech. We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic
Representations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask
learning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,
respiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,
eliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture
employs specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic
backbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on
the large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC
of 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),
particularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).
Our framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and
surpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while
correlation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit
meaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the
model's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized
acoustic patterns. By demonstrating that a single unified model can effectively
screen for diverse conditions, this work establishes a foundation for
deployable voice-based diagnostics in resource-constrained and remote
healthcare settings.

Conclusion: 该多模态框架通过燃识别选择策略有效提升了语音情感识别的性能，为多模态情感识别领域提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion
recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and
textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that
consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that
consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions
generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based
on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of
primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three
sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent
integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and
MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and
reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据筛选和训练，OLMoASR模型在零样本语音识别任务上表现出色，与现有最佳模型性能相当。数据集、模型和代码将公开以促进鲁棒语音处理研究。

Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant
advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In
this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of
models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition
models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio
and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or
mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M
hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use
OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M
(tiny.en) to 1.5B (large.en) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR
achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and
long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, OLMoASR-medium.en attains a
12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest
English-only model Whisper-medium.en's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and
long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count).
OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will
be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

Motivation: 现有VAD方法在噪声环境中缺乏鲁棒性，且帧级分类损失与VAD评估指标关联不紧密，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用Sinc提取器前端（可学习带通滤波器）捕获抗噪声频谱特征，结合二次差异排序损失优化语音和非语音帧的成对分数顺序。

Result: 在代表性基准数据集上实验显示，AUROC和F2-Score显著提升，参数使用量仅为先前方法的69%。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持高效率的同时实现了更好的VAD性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Voice activity detection (VAD) is essential for speech-driven applications,
but remains far from perfect in noisy and resource-limited environments.
Existing methods often lack robustness to noise, and their frame-wise
classification losses are only loosely coupled with the evaluation metric of
VAD. To address these challenges, we propose SincQDR-VAD, a compact and robust
framework that combines a Sinc-extractor front-end with a novel quadratic
disparity ranking loss. The Sinc-extractor uses learnable bandpass filters to
capture noise-resistant spectral features, while the ranking loss optimizes the
pairwise score order between speech and non-speech frames to improve the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A series of
experiments conducted on representative benchmark datasets show that our
framework considerably improves both AUROC and F2-Score, while using only 69%
of the parameters compared to prior arts, confirming its efficiency and
practical viability.

*Holger Severin Bovbjerg,Jan Østergaard,Jesper Jensen,Shinji Watanabe,Zheng-Hua Tan*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征蒸馏的预训练方法，用于从双耳语音中学习鲁棒的空间表示，无需数据标签，然后在DoA估计任务上进行微调，在噪声和混响环境中表现出更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度表示学习在音频任务中表现出色，但从多通道音频中学习空间表示的研究不足。需要探索无监督学习方法来获取鲁棒的空间表示。

Method: 使用特征蒸馏预训练框架：从干净双耳语音样本计算空间特征作为预测标签，然后通过神经网络从增强语音预测这些特征。预训练后丢弃空间特征预测器，使用学习到的编码器权重初始化DoA估计模型并进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，经过微调的预训练模型在噪声和混响环境中的方向到达(DoA)估计任务上，相比全监督模型和传统信号处理方法，表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 基于特征蒸馏的无监督预训练方法能够有效学习空间表示，为DoA估计等空间音频任务提供更好的初始化权重，在复杂声学环境中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in
multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations
from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a
pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial
representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this
framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to
form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from
corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we
throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to
initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our
experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in
noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival
estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal
processing methods.

Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在低级听觉能力（如音高和持续时间检测）方面研究不足，而这些能力对于处理未知声音的实际应用至关重要

Method: 提出World-of-Whale基准测试（WoW-Bench），包含识别新声音的感知测试和基于Bloom分类法的认知测试，通过海洋哺乳动物叫声进行评估，并添加干扰问题确保模型真正通过听觉解决问题

Result: 对现有最先进的大型音频语言模型进行测试，表现远差于人类水平

Conclusion: 大型音频语言模型在低级听觉能力方面存在显著缺口，需要加强音响基础能力的培养和评估

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the
auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as
pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level
listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models
must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To
address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to
evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal
vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing
novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess
the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the
Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate
whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying
on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance
far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in
LALMs.

TL;DR: 该研究将最优资产配置问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出将时间序列密集编码器(TiDE)集成到DDPG强化学习框架中，在模拟金融场景中开发动态投资策略，相比Q学习和买入持有策略获得更高风险调整收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统资产配置方法依赖严格分布假设或非可加性奖励比率，限制了其鲁棒性和对投资目标的适用性。需要克服这些限制，开发更灵活的动态资产配置方法。

Method: 将最优两资产配置问题构建为序列决策任务，使用Kelly准则平衡即时奖励和长期目标，创新地将TiDE集成到DDPG强化学习框架中进行连续决策。

Result: DDPG-TiDE方法在实证结果中优于Q学习框架，相比被动买入持有策略产生更高的风险调整收益。

Conclusion: 将TiDE集成到DDPG强化学习框架中是解决最优资产配置问题的有效途径，值得进一步探索。

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a
persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets.
Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive
reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment
goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal
two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of
reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on
simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly
criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment
objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense
Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework
for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple
discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment
strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and
generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings
suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE
within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further
exploration.

Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional
quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules
often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to
rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this
paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement
Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical
indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio
management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23
years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks
across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum
indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL
framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data
processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning
and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9
baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market
regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and
downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at

Conclusion: 语言是人类读心能力、合作、自尊和情感的基础，构成了人类文化和社会的基石

Abstract: A unified theory of language combines a Bayesian cognitive linguistic model
of language processing, with the proposal that language evolved by sexual
selection for the display of intelligence. The theory accounts for the major
facts of language, including its speed and expressivity, and data on language
diversity, pragmatics, syntax and semantics. The computational element of the
theory is based on Construction Grammars. These give an account of the syntax
and semantics of the worlds languages, using constructions and unification. Two
novel elements are added to construction grammars: an account of language
pragmatics, and an account of fast, precise language learning. Constructions
are represented in the mind as graph like feature structures. People use slow
general inference to understand the first few examples they hear of any
construction. After that it is learned as a feature structure, and is rapidly
applied by unification. All aspects of language (phonology, syntax, semantics,
and pragmatics) are seamlessly computed by fast unification; there is no
boundary between semantics and pragmatics. This accounts for the major puzzles
of pragmatics, and for detailed pragmatic phenomena. Unification is Bayesian
maximum likelihood pattern matching. This gives evolutionary continuity between
language processing in the human brain, and Bayesian cognition in animal
brains. Language is the basis of our mind reading abilities, our cooperation,
self esteem and emotions; the foundations of human culture and society.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于光子计算的光子受限玻尔兹曼机（PRBM），通过高效编码方法将吉布斯采样的计算复杂度从O(N)降低到O(1)，并实验验证了其在物理模拟和内容生成任务中的有效性。

Motivation: 传统受限玻尔兹曼机（RBM）在内容生成任务中，吉布斯采样的高计算成本限制了电子实现的效率，需要寻找更高效的实现方式。

Method: 利用光子计算架构构建光子受限玻尔兹曼机，采用高效编码方法避免计算密集的矩阵分解，实现非冯·诺依曼架构，绕过交互矩阵的存储需求。

Result: 实验验证了光子加速吉布斯采样的有效性，二维伊辛模型的相变温度与理论预测高度吻合；PRBM在图像和时间序列的生成与恢复任务中表现出鲁棒性，即使在噪声和畸变情况下也能良好工作。

Conclusion: PRBM框架具有可扩展性和降低的训练成本，为光子计算在生成式人工智能领域的应用提供了有前景的发展路径。

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising
model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and
stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of
Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on
electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann
machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling,
enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding
method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix
decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from
$O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture
circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial
advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the
photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising
model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the
theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates
robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including
images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations.
The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its
potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative
artificial intelligence.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提升代码生成模型的效率性能，同时保持高正确性，具有实用价值

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in
code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency,
limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To
address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement
learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this
framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying
then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration
overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the
discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive
reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial
for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3)
Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness
baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method,
which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency.
The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves
code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model,
achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

Motivation: SMT求解器在现代系统和编程语言研究中至关重要，但其正确性测试面临挑战。现有测试技术难以跟上求解器的快速演进，而基于LLM的方法存在语法无效率高和计算开销大的问题。

Method: Chimera框架使用LLM：(1)从文档中自动提取SMT理论的上下文无关文法；(2)合成符合这些文法的可组合布尔术语生成器。在模糊测试时，用LLM合成的生成器产生的术语填充现有公式的结构骨架。

Result: 在Z3和cvc5两个主流SMT求解器上评估，Chimera发现了43个已确认的bug，其中40个已被开发者修复。

Conclusion: Chimera通过转向术语生成器合成而非直接公式生成，有效确保了语法有效性并促进了语义多样性，同时大幅降低了运行时成本，只需一次性的LLM交互投入。

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems
and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like
symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the
critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas
are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed
well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly
evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show
promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain:
nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative
interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In
this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that
addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the
synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly,
Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for
SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)
synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.
During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing
formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.
This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.
Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,
dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT
solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43
confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

Motivation: 现代微服务系统日益复杂，故障频发，现有根因定位方法要么依赖预定义模式难以适应动态环境，要么缺乏可解释性。通过研究SRE专家的分析过程，发现其具有递归性、多维扩展和跨模态推理三大特征，因此需要开发能够模拟这些特性的自适应方法。

Conclusion: RCLAgent通过模拟人类专家的分析特征，显著提高了复杂微服务环境中根因定位的效率和精确度，为系统可靠性保障提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and
complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained,
interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring
system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces
and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing
methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to
evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning
process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this
paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of
failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different
organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis
exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion,
and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent,
an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that
leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a
novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process,
effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to
accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public
datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing
the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art
methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore
the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root
cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Conclusion: LLM在生成实际微服务代码方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来提高代码合成能力，特别是在复杂业务逻辑咏系统集成方面。

Abstract: In this paper we evaluate how far LLMs have advanced in generating code for
real-world problems. Specifically, we explore code synthesis for
microservice-based applications, a widely used architecture pattern. We define
a standard template for specifying these applications, and we propose a metric
for judging the difficulty level of a specification. The higher the score, the
more difficult it is to generate code for the specification. We develop a
framework to automate the process of testing LLM-synthesized code for a
microservice using unit tests. Our experimental results show that strong LLMs
(like GPT-3o-mini) do fairly well on medium difficulty specifications but do
very poorly on those of higher difficulty levels. This is due to more intricate
business logic, a greater use of external services, database integration and
inclusion of non-functional capabilities such as authentication. We analyzed
the errors in LLM-synthesized code and report on the key challenges LLMs face
in generating code for these specifications thereby suggesting future research
directions to improve code synthesis for real-world problems.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text
generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation,
tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism,
dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality
assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer
architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt
Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess
the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer:
directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at
the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference
core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software
engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community
reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics,
and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that
underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of
collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate},
and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance
framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring.
Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal
to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We
propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}}
(AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the
test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种将触觉传感器数据映射到电刺激模式的通用编码策略，使神经类器官能够执行开环人工触觉盲文分类任务。使用人前脑类器官在微电极阵列上进行系统刺激，实现了61%的单类器官分类准确率和83%的三类器官集成准确率。

Motivation: 探索类器官作为低功耗、自适应生物混合计算元件的潜力，为未来可扩展的生物混合计算架构提供基础编码框架。

Method: 使用低密度微电极阵列培养人前脑类器官，系统表征电刺激参数与类器官响应之间的关系，基于事件触觉传感器输入实现编码策略。

Result: 单类器官平均盲文字母分类准确率达61%，三类器官集成后显著提升至83%，多类器官配置对人工噪声表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了类器官作为生物混合计算元件的可行性，为开发可扩展的生物混合计算系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: This study proposes a generalizable encoding strategy that maps tactile
sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to
perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human
forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are
systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical
stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and
trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial
displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile
inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille
letter classification accuracy of 61 percent with a single organoid, which
increased significantly to 83 percent when responses from a three-organoid
ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration
demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially
introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as
low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a
foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出POS2FS框架，结合粒子群优化和三支决策理论，解决在线稀疏流特征选择中的数据缺失和特征-标签关系不确定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中高维流数据常存在数据不完整问题，现有在线稀疏流特征选择方法在处理特征-标签相关性不确定时表现不佳，导致模型不灵活和性能下降

Method: 使用粒子群优化(PSO)减少特征-标签关系的不确定性，引入三支决策理论处理监督学习中的特征模糊性

Result: 在六个真实数据集上的测试表明，POS2FS优于传统的OSFS和OS2FS技术，通过更鲁棒的特征子集选择获得更高准确率

Conclusion: POS2FS框架有效解决了在线稀疏流特征选择中的数据缺失和不确定性挑战，提供了更灵活和性能更好的解决方案

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online
streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical
deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or
technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS)
mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing
methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to
inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work
proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection
framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach
introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label
relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in
supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms
POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher
accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

Conclusion: 首次实证证明低层高度可调SNN在医学成像中能超越标准框架，特别是在数据有限、时间受限的诊断场景中，为精准医学中的神经启发AI开辟了新途径

Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as
energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep
learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains
almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first
tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health
status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and
broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the
Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a
standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse
medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning
algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and
Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully
customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using
leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter
optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that
the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based
implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior
adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training
overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that
low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical
imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic
settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision
medicine.

Conclusion: 该方法为实时、低功耗自然语言处理应用提供了有吸引力的解决方案，使脉冲大语言模型更适合在边缘设备和功耗受限环境中部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges for deployment in
energy-constrained environments due to their large model sizes and high
inference latency. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the sparse
event-driven neural processing and energy-efficient information transmission in
the brain, offer a promising alternative for achieving low-power computing.
Integrating the event-driven efficiency of spiking neurons with the advanced
capabilities of LLMs represents a promising direction for power-efficient LLMs.
This work specifically delves into the design of compressed spiking LLMs. Here,
we revisit spatial and temporal pruning from the perspective of SNNs and
propose a novel spatio-temporal pruning framework for Spiking LLMs to optimize
computational efficiency while preserving high performance. Our spatial pruning
technique reduces the number of active neurons and attention heads, effectively
lowering the computational complexity of the model. Meanwhile, temporal pruning
minimizes inference latency by dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps
required for different layers. By combining these approaches with other
compression techniques, we present the first work in the domain of Spiking LLMs
to jointly explore spatial pruning, temporal pruning, extreme quantization and
knowledge distillation strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation of our
proposed framework for SpikingBERT on the large-scale GLUE benchmark
demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in terms of computational operations
and inference latency. Our approach offers a compelling solution for real-time,
low-power natural language processing applications, making Spiking LLMs more
practical for deployment on edge devices and in power-constrained settings.

*Jessica Kinnevan,Naifa Alqahtani,Toral Chauhan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 利用iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR技术实现实时背景移除，替代传统绿幕和AI方法，在60fps下稳定运行，主要限制是深度图分辨率较低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统背景移除技术如绿幕和AI模型受光照条件限制，LiDAR的深度信息不受光照影响，能在各种光线环境下稳定工作

Method: 集成iPhone 15 Pro Max的LiDAR和彩色摄像头，使用SwiftUI和Swift框架开发界面和后台，Metal Shader Language实现实时图像增强，达到60fps帧率

Result: 成功实现实时背景移除，性能稳定，主要限制是深度图分辨率仅为320x240，且某些材料可能影响LiDAR深度测量精度

Conclusion: 如果移动设备LiDAR分辨率能提升到与彩色图像匹配，LiDAR有望成为视频和摄影应用中背景移除的主流技术

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile
devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and
compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI
models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and
performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the
LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image
processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and
backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image
enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per
second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming
bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution
to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect
accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device
like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR
could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video
applications and photography.

Result: 仅使用50个标注点云，平均IoU从33.5%提升至51.8%，整体准确率从85.5%提升至90.8%。

Conclusion: 跨数据集预训练是提升泛化能力的关键，该研究为低数据场景下的鲁棒3D语义分割提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation
pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and
seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first,
a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of
public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a
lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along
the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch
normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within
our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized
ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from
our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean
Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5%
to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our
results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to
improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited
in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework
for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades,
largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient
delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging
modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have
current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this
work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its
progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles,
including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of
prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder
components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven
key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning,
(2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3)
advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of
foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to
probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D
segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高度准确、高效且可扩展的临床肺结节筛查和监测工具，具有改善早期肺癌检测的潜力

Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies
on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional
methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical
approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in
nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a
multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias
correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated
on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a
mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression,
with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms
existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have
errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our
results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold
acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate,
efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring,
with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Conclusion: 该框架为高质量心脏磁共振重建提供了统一且稳健的解决方案，为临床异构采集协议的适应性部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction
remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image
quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We
propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture
employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance
reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative
optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with
residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to
deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions:
(1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on
structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction
blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which
regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric
KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR
surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving
0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various
acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the
contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and
generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for
high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable
deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Method: 使用在自然图像上预训练的DINOv3-H+视觉变换器，通过低秩适应(LoRA)进行参数高效微调(仅65万可训练参数)，并采用广泛的数据增强策略。

Result: 尽管存在领域差异，DINOv3在组织病理学图像上表现出良好的迁移能力，在初步测试集上达到0.8871的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: DINOv3预训练具有强大鲁棒性，结合参数高效微调方法，为MIDOG 2025的异常有丝分裂分类任务提供了强有力的基线解决方案。

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division
associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to
low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG
2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple
domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision
transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation.
Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology,
achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These
results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when
combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline
for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Method: 设计统一多说话人编码器(UME)，使用共享语音基础编码器，通过残差加权求和编码(RWSE)整合多层级隐藏表示，实现任务间的自底向上对齐和联合训练。

Result: 在LibriMix评估集上，UME显著超越单任务基线模型，说话人日志错误率在Libri2Mix和Libri3Mix上分别达到1.37%和2.29%，优于先前研究。

Conclusion: UME通过联合学习相关任务并利用多层级语义信息，有效提升了重叠语音处理任务的性能，证明了多任务联合学习的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel
architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD),
speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR)
tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden
representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding
(RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels,
contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach
captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall
performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME
substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and
multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms
the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on
Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

Conclusion: CodecBench为音频编解码器提供了一个全面的评估框架，有助于推动该领域在复杂场景下的发展，代码已在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: With the rise of multimodal large language models (LLMs), audio codec plays
an increasingly vital role in encoding audio into discrete tokens, enabling
integration of audio into text-based LLMs. Current audio codec captures two
types of information: acoustic and semantic. As audio codec is applied to
diverse scenarios in speech language model , it needs to model increasingly
complex information and adapt to varied contexts, such as scenarios with
multiple speakers, background noise, or richer paralinguistic information.
However, existing codec's own evaluation has been limited by simplistic metrics
and scenarios, and existing benchmarks for audio codec are not designed for
complex application scenarios, which limits the assessment performance on
complex datasets for acoustic and semantic capabilities. We introduce
CodecBench, a comprehensive evaluation dataset to assess audio codec
performance from both acoustic and semantic perspectives across four data
domains. Through this benchmark, we aim to identify current limitations,
highlight future research directions, and foster advances in the development of
audio codec. The codes are available at https://github.com/RayYuki/CodecBench.

Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to
replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is
Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate
preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been
difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the
introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we
implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to
reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of
lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based
on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained.
The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real
time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the
results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of
electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch
sound'' beginning in 2019.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文评估了当前最先进的音频欺骗检测方法在清洗攻击下的表现，发现这些系统在面对混响和加性噪声等攻击时性能显著下降，表明需要开发更鲁棒的检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语音克隆技术质量的提升和低成本服务的普及，该技术可能被滥用。现有的检测方法主要在干净音频数据库上评估，缺乏对清洗攻击的鲁棒性研究。

Method: 创建了基于ASVSpoof 2019的清洗攻击数据库（ASVSpoof Laundering Database），包含1388.22小时音频记录，评估了7种最先进的音频欺骗检测方法在清洗攻击下的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，最先进的音频欺骗检测系统在面对攻击性清洗攻击（特别是混响和加性噪声攻击）时表现很差。

Conclusion: 当前音频欺骗检测方法对清洗攻击缺乏鲁棒性，需要开发更强大的检测系统来应对实际应用中的各种攻击场景。

Abstract: Voice-cloning (VC) systems have seen an exceptional increase in the realism
of synthesized speech in recent years. The high quality of synthesized speech
and the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential
abuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed
over the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.
However, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,
such as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection
approaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new
laundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is
created. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database
comprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof
detection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results
indicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive
laundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This
suggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.

unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered
audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised

configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach
incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a

TL;DR: 提出Mixture of Contexts (MoC)稀疏注意力路由模块，通过动态选择信息块和强制锚点来解决长视频生成中的长上下文记忆问题，实现近线性计算复杂度扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成本质上是长上下文记忆问题，需要模型在长范围内保留和检索显著事件。传统扩散变换器的二次自注意力成本使得内存和计算在长序列上难以处理。

Method: 将长上下文视频生成重新构建为内部信息检索任务，使用可学习的稀疏注意力路由模块MoC。每个查询动态选择少量信息块加上强制锚点（标题、局部窗口）进行注意力计算，采用因果路由防止循环闭合。

Result: 随着数据规模的扩大和路由的逐渐稀疏化，模型将计算资源分配给显著历史信息，在数分钟内容中保持身份、动作和场景的一致性。实现了近线性计算扩展，支持实际训练和合成。

Conclusion: MoC模块通过有效的长期记忆检索机制，解决了长视频生成中的计算和内存瓶颈，在分钟级别上实现了记忆和一致性的涌现。

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models
must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing
or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context
videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which
makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long
sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information
retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,
Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.
In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory
anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that
prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the
routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,
actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct
of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and
synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于搜索的LLM性能优化方法缺乏硬件感知能力，而人类性能工程师依赖硬件特性实现近最优利用率，需要让LLM具备硬件意识来进行软件级优化

Method: 通过利用工作负载的特定内存访问模式、架构规格、过滤的性能日志和历史性能反思，为LLM提供明确的硬件感知能力，自动生成GPU内核的空间优化

Result: GEMM内核优化时间从2周缩短到5分钟；10个ML和科学计算内核中9个实现优化，最高加速2.06倍，L2命中率提升70%

Conclusion: 这是系统化创建硬件感知LLM性能工程代理的第一步，展示了硬件意识对LLM性能优化的重要价值

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance
engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around
runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human
performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization --
hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access
patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections
on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are
tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates
spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving
LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same
hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance
engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels,
SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve
up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the
first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM
performance engineering agents.

Motivation: 边缘设备上部署transformer模型面临计算资源不足的挑战，现有方法要么通信开销大，要么准确率和效率权衡不佳。

Method: 利用transformer的可分解性和可集成性，将大型模型分解为多个小型模型进行分布式推理，使用DeBo算法优化分解策略并校准模型性能。

Result: 实现了3.1倍推理加速，GPT2-XL模型内存需求减少76.3%，能耗降低约40%，同时保持满意的推理性能。

Conclusion: CoFormer为异构边缘设备上的大型transformer模型提供了高效的协作推理解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment
of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However,
ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant
challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource
requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload
transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models
on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either
considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy
and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative
inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central
idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of
transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple
smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are
aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem
to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous
hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the
optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively
calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the
capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge
devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer
models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6
billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%.
CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while
maintaining satisfactory inference performance.

Abstract: Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of
metastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.
This study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict
metastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)
images, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor
and organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer
extracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features
were obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random
forest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,
smoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived
features. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to
predict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold
cross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity
(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed
single-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of
0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive
performance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).
Stratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation
studies indicated complementary information from different modalities.
Evaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation
learning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated
high accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a
comprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has
potential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment
planning.

Method: 建立理论框架模型，管理者选择团队并利用AI替代未选员工，员工选择努力程度。分析NP完全优化问题，提供线性实例的高效算法，并进行大量模拟验证。

Result: 发现即使AI几乎无效，员工也可能完全不努力；管理者优化问题是NP完全的；低价值员工对维持整体产出起关键作用，排除他们会引发连锁反应。

Conclusion: 生成式AI在团队协作中具有双重影响，既能提升效率也可能破坏激励机制。管理者需要谨慎使用AI替代策略，重视每个员工的价值贡献。

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to
shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce
effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a
theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such
settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task,
with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much
effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We
show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost
ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is
NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of
(almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low
individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and
excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive
simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Motivation: 共享出行系统要成功必须提供有吸引力的服务，但由于每个旅客的时间价值异质性强，具有不同的价格接受水平，运营商需要学习这些个人偏好来优化定价

Method: 提出了一种适应性定价策略，运营商每天构建个性化招待，逐渐满足旅客期望并吸引增长的需求

Result: 运营商可以在10天内学习到共享旅客个人偏好，准确率超过90%，通过个性化定价提高了旅客效用和运营商利润

Conclusion: 通过学习个人旅客的行为特征，运营商不仅可以提高旅客效用，还能增加自身利润，同时可以清除效率低下的共享行程，专注于有吸引力且盈利的组合

Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely
compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a
strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable
price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels
can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in
$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing
policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively
meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results
suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual
travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)
but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the
operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and
profitable combinations.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum
machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw
data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where
shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In
the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question
arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential
privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?
This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to
safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance
through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach
achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between
differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off
between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the
framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise
model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on
critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores
for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable
trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for
secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum
computing applications.

Abstract: Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework that allows users to
design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. We explore
post-training techniques for LLMs to assist in writing Qiskit code. We
introduce quantum verification as an effective method for ensuring code quality
and executability on quantum hardware. To support this, we developed a
synthetic data pipeline that generates quantum problem-unit test pairs and used
it to create preference data for aligning LLMs with DPO. Additionally, we
trained models using GRPO, leveraging quantum-verifiable rewards provided by
the quantum hardware. Our best-performing model, combining DPO and GRPO,
surpasses the strongest open-source baselines on the challenging
Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

TL;DR: OnGoal是一个LLM聊天界面，通过实时目标对齐反馈、评估结果解释和目标进展概览，帮助用户更有效地管理对话目标进度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着与大型语言模型的多轮对话变得越来越长和复杂，用户需要更好的工具来评估和跟踪对话目标的进展

Method: 开发OnGoal系统，提供LLM辅助的实时目标对齐评估、结果解释和进展可视化，并通过20人参与的研究与基线聊天界面进行对比

Result: 使用OnGoal的参与者花费更少时间和精力达成目标，尝试更多提示策略来克服沟通障碍，目标跟踪和可视化增强了对话参与度和韧性

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来LLM聊天界面设计提供了启示，包括改进目标沟通、降低认知负荷、增强交互性和提供反馈以提升LLM性能

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and
more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their
conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users
better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal
alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results
with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to
navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20
participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat
interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and
effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to
overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can
enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired
design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal
communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable
feedback to improve LLM performance.

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: MicroLad是一个潜在扩散框架，通过2D图像重建3D微观结构，结合分数蒸馏采样实现逆向控制的2D到3D生成，扩展了微观结构分析和设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 材料工程中缺乏多样化的3D微观结构数据集，限制了结构-性能关联研究和逆向设计问题的进展。现有数据集可用性有限且对分析设计空间控制不足。

Method: 提出MicroLad潜在扩散框架，在潜在空间中进行多平面去噪扩散采样，从2D数据重建3D微观结构。集成分数蒸馏采样(SDS)，结合可微分分数损失、微观结构描述符匹配和性能对齐项，实现逆向控制的2D到3D生成。

Result: 框架能够可靠地生成稳定且连贯的3D体积，在统计上与原始数据保持一致。实现了从2D数据生成统计等效的3D样本的维度扩展能力。

Conclusion: MicroLad方法促进了在微观结构描述符和材料性能方面的扩展3D微观结构分析和设计空间的探索，为解决逆向设计问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A major obstacle to establishing reliable structure-property (SP) linkages in
materials engineering is the scarcity of diverse 3D microstructure datasets.
Limited dataset availability and insufficient control over the analysis and
design space restrict the variety of achievable microstructure morphologies,
hindering progress in solving the inverse (property-to-structure) design
problem. To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion
framework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D
data. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion
sampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and
coherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original
data. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion
(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,
effective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the
generation process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad
integrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable
score loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment
terms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent
space, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.
Consequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D
microstructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural
descriptors and material properties.

Abstract: Operator learning offers a robust framework for approximating mappings
between infinite-dimensional function spaces. It has also become a powerful
tool for solving inverse problems in the computational sciences. This chapter
surveys methodological and theoretical developments at the intersection of
operator learning and inverse problems. It begins by summarizing the
probabilistic and deterministic approaches to inverse problems, and pays
special attention to emerging measure-centric formulations that treat observed
data or unknown parameters as probability distributions. The discussion then
turns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data
generation, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing
function-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end
inverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to
the solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the
forward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this
data-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both
point predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for
linear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the
estimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more
selectively within classical inversion algorithms.

Conclusion: 该LLM元数据采集工具为生态和环境数据集在虚拟研究环境中的发现和整合提供了灵活有效的解决方案

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by
enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple
sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate,
researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider
platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this
obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental
datasets in a virtual research environment.

Conclusion: 微调大型语言模型可以有效识别研究主题间的语义关系，为解决本体构建和维护的挑战提供了有前景的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Ontologies and taxonomies of research fields are critical for managing and
organising scientific knowledge, as they facilitate efficient classification,
dissemination and retrieval of information. However, the creation and
maintenance of such ontologies are expensive and time-consuming tasks, usually
requiring the coordinated effort of multiple domain experts. Consequently,
ontologies in this space often exhibit uneven coverage across different
disciplines, limited inter-domain connectivity, and infrequent updating cycles.
In this study, we investigate the capability of several large language models
to identify semantic relationships among research topics within three academic
domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the
three disciplines considered in this study: MeSH, PhySH, and IEEE. Our
experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on PEM-Rel-8K yields excellent
performance across all disciplines.

Method: 提出ReVol方法：1）对价格特征进行归一化以去除样本特异性；2）使用注意力模块准确估计特征；3）重新整合样本特征；同时结合几何布朗运动进行长期趋势建模和神经网络进行短期模式识别。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，ReVol在大多数情况下都能提升最先进骨干模型的性能，IC平均提升超过0.03，SR平均提升超过0.7。

Conclusion: ReVol通过有效处理分布偏移问题，为股票价格预测提供了更加鲁棒和准确的解决方案，证明了其在各种设置下的优越性能。

Abstract: How can we address distribution shifts in stock price data to improve stock
price prediction accuracy? Stock price prediction has attracted attention from
both academia and industry, driven by its potential to uncover complex market
patterns and enhance decisionmaking. However, existing methods often fail to
handle distribution shifts effectively, focusing on scaling or representation
adaptation without fully addressing distributional discrepancies and shape
misalignments between training and test data. We propose ReVol
(Return-Volatility Normalization for Mitigating Distribution Shift in Stock
Price Data), a robust method for stock price prediction that explicitly
addresses the distribution shift problem. ReVol leverages three key strategies
to mitigate these shifts: (1) normalizing price features to remove
sample-specific characteristics, including return, volatility, and price scale,
(2) employing an attention-based module to estimate these characteristics
accurately, thereby reducing the influence of market anomalies, and (3)
reintegrating the sample characteristics into the predictive process, restoring
the traits lost during normalization. Additionally, ReVol combines geometric
Brownian motion for long-term trend modeling with neural networks for
short-term pattern recognition, unifying their complementary strengths.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ReVol enhances
the performance of the state-of-the-art backbone models in most cases,
achieving an average improvement of more than 0.03 in IC and over 0.7 in SR
across various settings.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by
breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer
powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research
practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current
landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical
research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of
recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et
al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while
state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and
evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of
self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy
and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI
into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented
mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical
guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding
principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore
seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from
creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these
principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than
automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting,
critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use
these powerful tools.

Abstract: Effective String Theory (EST) offers a robust non-perturbative framework for
describing confinement in Yang-Mills theory by treating the confining flux tube
between a static quark-antiquark pair as a thin, vibrating string. While EST
calculations are typically carried out using zeta-function regularization,
certain problems-such as determining the flux tube width-are too complex to
solve analytically. However, recent studies have demonstrated that EST can be
explored numerically by employing deep learning techniques based on generative
algorithms. In this work, we provide a brief introduction to EST and this novel
numerical approach. Finally, we present results for the width of the
Nambu-Got\"o EST.

Abstract: Data has become a foundational asset driving innovation across domains such
as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. In these areas, predictive modeling
over relational tables is commonly employed, with increasing emphasis on
reducing manual effort through automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques.
This raises an interesting question: can feature augmentation itself be
automated and identify and utilize task-related relational signals?
  To address this challenge, we propose an end-to-end automated feature
augmentation framework, ReCoGNN, which enhances initial datasets using features
extracted from multiple relational tables to support predictive tasks. ReCoGNN
first captures semantic dependencies within each table by modeling intra-table
attribute relationships, enabling it to partition tables into structured,
semantically coherent segments. It then constructs a heterogeneous weighted
graph that represents inter-row relationships across all segments. Finally,
ReCoGNN leverages message-passing graph neural networks to propagate
information through the graph, guiding feature selection and augmenting the
original dataset. Extensive experiments conducted on ten real-life and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that ReCoGNN consistently outperforms existing
methods on both classification and regression tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as
text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering.
Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management
systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies
such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly
within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However,
open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor
performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source
systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to
expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked
LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs,
optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented
initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL
queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is
the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Result: 在TripAdvisor和RateBeer数据集上的实验结果表明，ELIXIR在评论生成方面显著优于强基线模型，即使使用较小模型也能更好地匹配用户偏好。

Conclusion: ELIXIR通过方面建模和个性化注意力机制，有效指导个性化上下文中的文本生成，为推荐系统提供了高效且轻量级的解释生成解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

Method: 提出MPFormer动态多任务Transformer框架，包含三个创新机制：1）目标条件化Transformer通过可学习注意力调制联合编码用户行为序列和多任务语义；2）引入个性化目标权重实现检索结果的动态调整；3）将用户个性化信息融入token表示和Transformer结构以增强模型表示能力。

Result: 该框架已成功集成到快手短视频推荐系统，稳定服务超过4亿日活跃用户，显著提升用户日常参与度和系统运营效率。实际部署验证显示，相比传统解决方案，在保持服务响应速度的同时有效优化了多目标检索的迭代范式。

Conclusion: MPFormer为工业推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的多目标解决方案，解决了多阶段优化不对齐问题，实现了在保持性能的同时的资源效率优化。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多行为序列推荐中，不同行为数据会带来噪声，传统方法认为低频信息可靠而高频信息是噪声，但本文认为高频信息同样重要，对应着用户兴趣的多样性。

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，有效提取不同频段信息及其关系，并引入Bootstrapping Balancer机制来平衡不同频率信息的贡献。

Result: 在真实数据集上的充分实验证明了模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 高频信息对应兴趣多样性，低频信息对应兴趣纯度，平衡两者的贡献可以显著提升多行为序列推荐性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实证研究揭示了向量嵌入模型在单向量范式下的根本局限性，即使在简单查询的现实场景中也会遇到理论限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、指令跟随等任务中的应用日益广泛，现有研究普遍认为向量嵌入的局限性主要源于不现实的查询，可以通过更好的训练数据和更大的模型来克服。本文旨在验证这些理论限制是否会在现实场景中出现

Method: 结合学习理论中的已知结果，证明嵌入维度限制了能够作为查询结果返回的top-k文档子集数量。通过实证研究验证这一理论，即使限制k=2并在测试集上自由参数化嵌入也成立。创建了一个名为LIMIT的现实数据集来压力测试模型

Result: 实证研究表明理论限制确实存在，即使是最先进的模型在简单的LIMIT数据集上也表现失败，尽管任务性质简单

Conclusion: 单向量范式下的嵌入模型存在根本性限制，需要未来研究开发能够解决这一根本限制的新方法

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专门评估零上下文推荐中公平性的基准测试，发现大型语言模型在冷启动场景下存在一致的性别和文化刻板印象偏见，并揭示了模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推荐任务中越来越受欢迎，但在冷启动场景下（只有年龄、性别或语言等有限信号可用时），它们可能依赖预训练中编码的社会偏见，引发公平性担忧。

Method: 引入模块化流水线，支持可配置的推荐领域和敏感属性，能够系统灵活地审计任何开源LLM。评估了Gemma 3和Llama 3.2等最先进模型。

Result: 在多个推荐领域（音乐、电影、大学）中发现一致的偏见，包括性别和文化刻板印象。同时揭示了模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。

Conclusion: 需要更细致的分析来理解LLM在冷启动推荐中的公平性问题，模型大小的增加并不总是带来公平性的线性改善。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出多种利用大语言模型(LLMs)进行会话推荐的方法，包括上下文LLM推荐代理、LLM生成的语义表示初始化，以及LLM与数据驱动模型的集成，实验表明集成方法在召回率和MRR指标上均优于单独使用LLM或传统模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有会话推荐模型主要依赖物品序列但忽略语义信息，而现有的LLM方法存在提示工程困难或计算成本高的问题，需要更有效的LLM集成方案。

Method: 提出三种LLM应用方式：(1)上下文LLM作为推荐代理；(2)LLM生成表示用于深度学习模型语义初始化；(3)LLM与数据驱动SR模型集成。

Result: 实验显示LLM方法在粗粒度检索(高召回率)表现优异，传统方法在细粒度排序(高MRR)表现好，而集成方法在Recall和MRR指标上均显著优于单独方法和基线模型。

Conclusion: LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成能够结合两者的优势，在会话推荐任务中取得最佳性能，为会话推荐提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏显式结构信息的数据集上微调预训练语言模型，无法有效利用结构特征和元素级语义，且缺乏包含结构元数据的数据集

Method: 提出SEAL对比学习框架，采用结构感知学习保持语义层次，使用掩码元素对齐进行细粒度语义判别

Result: 在多个现代PLM上实验显示性能持续提升，BGE-M3模型的NDCG@10从73.96%提升到77.84%，在线A/B测试也验证了效果

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效解决了长结构化文档检索中的结构信息利用问题，通过结构感知学习和细粒度语义对齐显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

<details>

Motivation: 自回归推荐模型在多域场景下，transformer架构的注意力图需要关注所有域的物品，成为计算瓶颈，需要高效平衡域间和域内知识迁移。

Method: 1) TAPE：域感知位置编码，考虑域转换信息，使注意力仅关注域内物品；2) DDSR：动态域状态表示，存储和访问域信息，避免使用完整注意力图。

Result: 为大规模多域推荐系统提供可扩展解决方案，在检索任务中通过分别建模和组合域间域内表示实现显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多域推荐中的计算效率问题，通过创新机制实现了域间知识的高效迁移，提升了系统可扩展性。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

Motivation: ReRAM交叉阵列中的随机噪声会降低DNN推理精度，需要设计既能抵抗噪声又高效节能的硬件加速器。

Method: 1) ReSNA：随机噪声感知训练方法；2) CF-MESMO：基于信息论的多目标优化算法，通过连续保真度评估降低计算成本。

Result: ReSNA在CIFAR-10数据集上使ResNet20推理精度提升2.57%；CF-MESMO相比NSGA-II减少90.91%计算成本。

Conclusion: 所提方法能高效找到高质量帕累托前沿，实现噪声鲁棒性、高精度和低能耗的平衡。

Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for
designing hardware accelerators for deep neural network (DNN) inferencing.
However, stochastic noise in ReRAM crossbars can degrade the DNN inferencing
accuracy. We propose the design and optimization of a high-performance,
area-and energy-efficient ReRAM-based hardware accelerator to achieve robust
DNN inferencing in the presence of stochastic noise. We make two key technical
contributions. First, we propose a stochastic-noise-aware training method,
referred to as ReSNA, to improve the accuracy of DNN inferencing on ReRAM
crossbars with stochastic noise. Second, we propose an information-theoretic
algorithm, referred to as CF-MESMO, to identify the Pareto set of solutions to
trade-off multiple objectives, including inferencing accuracy, area overhead,
execution time, and energy consumption. The main challenge in this context is
that executing the ReSNA method to evaluate each candidate ReRAM design is
prohibitive. To address this challenge, we utilize the continuous-fidelity
evaluation of ReRAM designs associated with prohibitive high computation cost
by varying the number of training epochs to trade-off accuracy and cost.
CF-MESMO iteratively selects the candidate ReRAM design and fidelity pair that
maximizes the information gained per unit computation cost about the optimal
Pareto front. Our experiments on benchmark DNNs show that the proposed
algorithms efficiently uncover high-quality Pareto fronts. On average, ReSNA
achieves 2.57% inferencing accuracy improvement for ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10
dataset with respect to the baseline configuration. Moreover, CF-MESMO
algorithm achieves 90.91% reduction in computation cost compared to the popular
multi-objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II to reach the best solution from
NSGA-II.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习技术在医疗设备自动检测中的应用增加，制造商面临欧盟AI法案等新监管框架的合规挑战，需要评估这些新技术在现有医疗设备合规环境中的适用性。

Method: 通过高层次技术评估，分析DL自动检测系统在风险管理原则、数据集治理、模型验证、可解释性要求和部署后监控义务等方面与现有法规的差异。

Result: 识别了制造商在合规过程中可能遇到的主要挑战，包括风险管理原则分歧、数据集治理要求、统计显著性验证困难、数据保留负担以及全球合规影响等问题。

Conclusion: DL自动检测系统在医疗设备领域的应用面临复杂的监管环境，制造商需要制定适当的实施策略，并建议咨询监管机构和法律专家来确定具体的合规路径。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic

Motivation: 参与式AI需要让受影响的社区成员和利益相关者参与AI系统的设计和开发，但如何识别、接触和吸引所有相关利益相关者群体（即招募方法）在实践中仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 通过分析37个AI项目的招募方法文档，捕捉该领域实践的多样性，并对5位AI研究人员进行访谈，了解招募方法的结果。

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices
for Participatory AI researchers.

Motivation: 研究AI驱动的自动化影响力操作的可行性和特征，特别是小型语言模型在政治宣传内容生成方面的能力。

Method: 使用小型语言模型生成角色驱动的政治信息，通过自动评估而非人工评分来分析内容质量和行为特征。

Result: 发现角色设计比模型身份更能解释行为；对抗性回复会增强意识形态坚持和极端内容；完全自动化的影响力内容生产已经可行。

Conclusion: 防御策略应从限制模型访问转向对话中心的检测和破坏活动协调基础设施，模型的一致性反而提供了检测特征。

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity
hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven
political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters.
Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design
explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor:
when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the
prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated
influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors.
Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards
conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination
infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these
operations also provides a detection signature.

TL;DR: 研究发现基于语言模型的Web和研究代理（WRAs）容易受到被动网络攻击者的推理攻击，攻击者仅通过分析网络元数据（访问的IP地址和时间）就能恢复73%的用户提示功能和领域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WRAs被组织和个人本地部署用于隐私、法律或财务目的，但与人类零星浏览不同，WRAs访问70-140个具有可识别时间相关性的域名，这使得它们容易受到独特的指纹识别攻击。

Method: 构建了基于用户搜索查询和合成角色生成查询的WRA跟踪数据集，定义了OBELS行为指标来评估原始提示与推断提示之间的相似性，并在多会话设置下扩展攻击。

Result: 攻击恢复了超过73%的用户提示功能和领域知识，在多会话设置中准确恢复了32个潜在特征中的19个，即使在部分可观察性和噪声条件下攻击仍然有效。

Conclusion: 提出了限制域名多样性或混淆跟踪的缓解策略，在平均降低29%攻击效果的同时对实用性影响可忽略不计。

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems
that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference
attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be
deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or
financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit
$70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique
fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack
against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP
addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces
based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We
define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity
between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over
73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a
multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high
accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy
conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain
diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing
attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

Motivation: 现有LLM水印方法如SynthID-Text在面对保持语义的改写攻击（如转述、复制粘贴修改、回译）时存在脆弱性，水印可检测性会显著下降。

Method: 提出SynGuard混合框架，将语义信息检索(SIR)的语义对齐能力与SynthID-Text的概率水印机制相结合，在词汇和语义两个层面共同嵌入水印。

Result: 在多种攻击场景下的实验表明，SynGuard相比SynthID-Text平均提升了11.1%的F1分数水印恢复能力。

Conclusion: 语义感知水印方法能有效抵抗现实世界中的篡改攻击，为AI生成文本的来源追踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM watermarking methods such as SynthID-Text by Google
DeepMind offer promising solutions for tracing the provenance of AI-generated
text. However, our robustness assessment reveals that SynthID-Text is
vulnerable to meaning-preserving attacks, such as paraphrasing, copy-paste
modifications, and back-translation, which can significantly degrade watermark
detectability. To address these limitations, we propose SynGuard, a hybrid
framework that combines the semantic alignment strength of Semantic Information
Retrieval (SIR) with the probabilistic watermarking mechanism of SynthID-Text.
Our approach jointly embeds watermarks at both lexical and semantic levels,
enabling robust provenance tracking while preserving the original meaning.
Experimental results across multiple attack scenarios show that SynGuard
improves watermark recovery by an average of 11.1\% in F1 score compared to
SynthID-Text. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of semantic-aware
watermarking in resisting real-world tampering. All code, datasets, and

to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding
outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to
raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when
incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational
cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the
need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the
AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights
from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can
better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BridgeShield是一个基于异构图注意力网络的跨链攻击检测框架，通过统一建模源链、链下协调和目标链来捕获跨链语义，在真实攻击事件中达到92.58%的F1分数，比现有方法提升24.39%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨链桥在区块链互操作性中至关重要，但由于设计缺陷和价值巨大，成为黑客攻击的主要目标。现有检测方法主要关注单链行为，无法捕捉跨链语义，存在明显局限性。

Method: 提出BridgeShield框架，利用异构图注意力网络建模多类型实体和关系，统一表示源链、链下协调和目标链。采用元路径内注意力学习跨链路径的细粒度依赖关系，元路径间注意力突出判别性跨链模式。

Result: 在51个真实跨链攻击事件上的实验表明，BridgeShield平均F1分数达到92.58%，相比最先进的基线方法提升了24.39%。

Conclusion: BridgeShield通过有效捕获跨链执行语义，能够精确识别攻击行为，为保护跨链桥安全和增强多链生态系统韧性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain
interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous
value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing
detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address
single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address
this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are
well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the
complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,
a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain
coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph
representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn
fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path
attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling
precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51
real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an
average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over
state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of
BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and
enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

TL;DR: 本综述论文探讨了联邦学习在医学影像全流程分析中的应用，包括上游重建任务和下游临床诊断任务，旨在解决医疗数据隐私保护下的模型训练难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI发展面临数据隐私法规限制，大规模集中式数据集训练困难，需要隐私保护的分布式训练方案来促进医学影像AI的发展。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，在医学影像全流程中实现分布式协作训练，包括CT/MRI重建等上游任务和肿瘤诊断分割等下游任务，通过多机构数据集联合训练而不共享原始数据。

Result: 联邦学习能够有效缓解医学数据稀缺问题，保护患者隐私，支持模型的持续更新和训练，提高了通信效率并确保了安全的参数聚合。

Conclusion: 联邦学习为医学影像AI提供了一种可行的隐私保护解决方案，未来需要进一步研究以推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated considerable potential in the
realm of medical imaging. However, the development of high-performance AI
models typically necessitates training on large-scale, centralized datasets.
This approach is confronted with significant challenges due to strict patient
privacy regulations and legal restrictions on data sharing and utilization.
These limitations hinder the development of large-scale models in medical
domains and impede continuous updates and training with new data. Federated
Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a
new solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented
medical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of
the full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT
or MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction
networks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity
while preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like
tumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by
allowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.
We comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging
pipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI
systems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align
heterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation. Meanwhile, this
paper provides an outlook on future research directions, aiming to serve as a
valuable reference for the field's development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI驱动的开发平台使软件开发更普及，但导致安全审计面临可扩展性危机，40%的AI生成代码存在漏洞，开发速度远超安全评估能力。

Method: 多代理系统结合大型语言模型编排、工具基础执行和端到端漏洞验证，进行自主Web应用安全评估。

Result: 在104个挑战的XBOW基准测试中：总体成功率76.9%；SSRF和配置错误漏洞完美表现；授权绕过成功率83%；模板注入85%；SQL注入83%；XSS 57%；盲注0%。成本分析显示总成本$21.38，成功中位数成本$0.073 vs 失败$0.357。

Conclusion: MAPTA在实际GitHub仓库中发现关键漏洞（RCE、命令注入、密钥泄露等），平均成本仅$3.67，10个发现正在CVE审核中，证明其在实际应用中的有效性和成本效益。

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a
broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis
in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code
contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the
capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application
security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with
tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge
XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance
on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken
authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side
template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%)
and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost
analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for
successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly
with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at
approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the
respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average
operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical
vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and
arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10
findings are under CVE review.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: JADES是一个通过分解评分来评估越狱攻击的通用框架，通过将有害问题分解为加权子问题并聚合评分，显著提高了评估准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的越狱评估方法依赖不匹配的代理指标或简单整体判断，经常误解模型响应，导致与人类感知不一致的主观评估。

Method: JADES自动将有害问题分解为加权子问题，对每个子答案进行评分，并通过加权聚合得出最终决策，还包含可选的事实核查模块来检测幻觉。

Result: 在二元设置下，JADES与人类评估者达成98.5%的一致性，比强基线高出9%以上。重新评估显示现有方法严重高估攻击成功率（如GPT-3.5-Turbo从93%降至69%）。

Conclusion: JADES能够提供准确、一致且可解释的评估，为衡量未来越狱攻击提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a
fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on
misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently
misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective
assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we
introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal
jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose
an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each
sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES
also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection
of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a
newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of
jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a
binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human
evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five
popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's
attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show
that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations,
providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统漏洞检测方法存在可扩展性、适应性差以及高误报漏报率的问题，AI方法严重依赖训练数据质量，需要更好的数据集生成技术。

Method: 使用多AI代理模拟专家推理，结合函数代理和传统代码分析工具，采用检索增强生成进行上下文接地，使用低秩权重近似进行高效模型微调。

Result: 在116个代码样本的三个基准测试中，该方法在函数级别漏洞注入方面达到89%到95%的成功率，在数据集准确性方面优于其他技术。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效生成高质量的漏洞数据集，为AI驱动的漏洞检测和修复系统提供了可靠的数据基础，解决了训练数据质量依赖问题。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of
cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated
vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static
program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability,
adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven
approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models,
show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training
data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically
introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++
codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI
agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and
traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation
for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for
efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from
three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other
techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\%
success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: 该论文研究了包含未知干扰参数的随机梯度优化问题，建立了非渐近收敛保证，表明在适当条件下（如Neyman正交性）标准随机梯度算法仍能收敛，并提出近似正交化更新变体来处理不满足正交性的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机梯度优化是各种学习场景的主导范式，但现有研究很少考虑目标函数依赖于未知干扰参数的情况，这会影响最优解和优化轨迹，需要理论分析其收敛性。

Method: 采用经典随机梯度算法及其变体（近似正交化梯度更新），在Neyman正交性条件下分析收敛性，并通过正交统计学习/双机器学习以及因果推断的实例进行验证。

Result: 证明了在适当条件下（如Neyman正交性），标准随机梯度算法仍能收敛；即使不满足正交性，近似正交化更新变体也能达到类似的收敛速率。

Conclusion: 对于依赖干扰参数的随机优化问题，Neyman正交性是关键条件，标准算法在满足该条件时有效，否则需要采用近似正交化方法来保证收敛性能。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is the dominant learning paradigm for a
variety of scenarios, from classical supervised learning to modern
self-supervised learning. We consider stochastic gradient algorithms for
learning problems whose objectives rely on unknown nuisance parameters, and
establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees. Our results show that, while
the presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization
trajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge
under appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when
Neyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with
approximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized
gradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates. Examples from
orthogonal statistical learning/double machine learning and causal inference
are discussed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种自一致性损失方法，用于在模型错误设定情况下改进摊销贝叶斯模型比较的可靠性，特别是在具有精确似然函数时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在模型错误设定（模型与真实数据分布不匹配）的情况下，基于神经代理的摊销贝叶斯模型比较的可靠性会下降，而这正是模型比较最需要的场景。

Method: 通过在基于模拟的训练基础上，增加对未标记真实数据的自一致性损失，来改进经验分布偏移下的贝叶斯模型比较估计。

Result: 自一致性损失在具有解析似然函数时显著改善了模型错误设定下的校准性能，但在使用神经代理似然时改进有限。

Conclusion: 自一致性损失方法在具有精确似然函数时对于可信赖的贝叶斯模型比较最为实用，为模型错误设定情况下的模型比较提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Amortized Bayesian model comparison (BMC) enables fast probabilistic ranking
of models via simulation-based training of neural surrogates. However, the
reliability of neural surrogates deteriorates when simulation models are
misspecified - the very case where model comparison is most needed. Thus, we
supplement simulation-based training with a self-consistency (SC) loss on
unlabeled real data to improve BMC estimates under empirical distribution
shifts. Using a numerical experiment and two case studies with real data, we
compare amortized evidence estimates with and without SC against analytic or
bridge sampling benchmarks. SC improves calibration under model
misspecification when having access to analytic likelihoods. However, it offers
limited gains with neural surrogate likelihoods, making it most practical for
trustworthy BMC when likelihoods are exact.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用多项式混沌展开(PCE)作为算子学习方法，用于近似偏微分方程的解算子，既能进行数据驱动学习也能结合物理约束，同时提供不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度神经网络方法在算子学习中取得了显著进展，但传统机器学习方法在该领域的探索相对较少。PCE在不确定性量化中广泛应用，最近在科学机器学习中受到关注，作者希望探索其在算子学习中的应用潜力。

Method: 建立PCE的数学框架，将算子学习任务转化为求解PCE系数的方程组。该方法支持纯数据驱动和物理信息两种设置，通过后处理PCE系数即可实现不确定性量化。

Result: 在多种偏微分方程问题上进行了测试，结果表明该方法在算子学习和不确定性量化任务中表现优异，具有出色的数值精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: PCE作为一种传统机器学习方法，在算子学习中展现出强大潜力，不仅能够有效近似解算子，还能无缝集成不确定性量化功能，为科学机器学习提供了新的工具选择。

Abstract: Operator learning (OL) has emerged as a powerful tool in scientific machine
learning (SciML) for approximating mappings between infinite-dimensional
functional spaces. One of its main applications is learning the solution
operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). While much of the progress
in this area has been driven by deep neural network-based approaches such as
Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet) and Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), recent
work has begun to explore traditional machine learning methods for OL. In this
work, we introduce polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) as an OL method. PCE has
been widely used for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and has recently gained
attention in the context of SciML. For OL, we establish a mathematical
framework that enables PCE to approximate operators in both purely data-driven
and physics-informed settings. The proposed framework reduces the task of
learning the operator to solving a system of equations for the PCE
coefficients. Moreover, the framework provides UQ by simply post-processing the
PCE coefficients, without any additional computational cost. We apply the
proposed method to a diverse set of PDE problems to demonstrate its
capabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the strong performance of the
proposed method in both OL and UQ tasks, achieving excellent numerical accuracy
and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In this paper, we extend the transfer learning classification framework from
regression function-based methods to decision rules. We propose a novel
methodology for modeling posterior drift through Bayes decision rules. By
exploiting the geometric transformation of the Bayes decision boundary, our
method reformulates the problem as a low-dimensional empirical risk
minimization problem. Under mild regularity conditions, we establish the
consistency of our estimators and derive the risk bounds. Moreover, we
illustrate the broad applicability of our method by adapting it to the
estimation of optimal individualized treatment rules. Extensive simulation
studies and analyses of real-world data further demonstrate both superior
performance and robustness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决自动驾驶赛车中既要遵守比赛规则（如优先权、避碰责任）又要实现高效超车的挑战，传统方法往往过于保守或忽略规则约束，需要一种既能保证安全性又能保持竞技性的规划方法。

Method: 采用规则合规模型预测控制，将赛车规则编码为混合逻辑动态约束；将车辆交互形式化为广义纳什均衡问题，使用迭代最佳响应方案求解；引入规则感知博弈论规划器，攻击方考虑防御方的规则约束行为。

Result: 仿真结果表明，RA-GTP优于假设非交互或规则不可知对手模型的基线方法，能够产生更有效的机动动作，同时始终保持对赛车规则的合规性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将规则约束与博弈论规划相结合，为自动驾驶赛车提供了既安全又具有竞争力的运动规划解决方案，在遵守规则的前提下实现了更优的超车性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for
autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model
Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and
collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical
Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a
Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using
an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the
Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons
over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer
enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and
non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms
baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models,
leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance
with racing regulations.

Result: 混合MFC在重需求下最大化吞吐量；混合GWC在各种交通条件下最小化主干道停车次数并保持连续性；纯代理控制在中等需求下改善全网旅行时间但在重需求下效果较差。

Conclusion: 层次化设计实现了自适应策略选择，在所有需求水平下都能获得鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining
arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local
intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and
control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement
learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that
selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a
Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected
strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC);
and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via
reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical
reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train
HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware,
GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their
respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to
dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing
corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed
and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC
maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes
arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but
can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time
in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical
design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across
all demand levels.

Motivation: 现有采样和PDE方法难以处理复杂变化动态，物理信息神经网络只能处理有限维固定参数变化，无法应对系统动态的函数变化，需要新的方法来解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出神经样条算子(NeSO)框架，利用B样条表示来学习从变化的函数系统动态到相应风险概率的映射，提高训练效率并改善初始和边界条件约束。

Conclusion: NeSO框架为风险量化问题提供了有效解决方案，其通用逼近定理也有望应用于风险量化之外的其他控制或PDE相关问题。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic
systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing
sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often
struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks
learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters
of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations
in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn
mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk
probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO
framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training
efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements,
which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical
analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also
present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with
high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and
its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework
and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be
beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk
quantification.

Conclusion: 该方法为处理非线性系统任意长时延提供了一种计算高效且理论保证的解决方案，神经算子学习在控制系统中具有重要应用价值

Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor
feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long
actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the
predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This
mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast
inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability
analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and
the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay.
We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical
convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the
predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using
a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times
compared to traditional numerical methods.

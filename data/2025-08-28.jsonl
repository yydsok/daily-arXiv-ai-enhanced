While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on\nperplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating\ntruthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we\nintroduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing\nthe truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on\nLogical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on\nImitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization\ntechniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source\nLLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally\ntruthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs\nunder misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased\nvariants of \"honest\", \"neutral\" and \"deceptive\" prompts and observe that\n\"deceptive\" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas \"honest\"\nand \"neutral\" prompts maintain stable outputs.

This paper seeks to leverage comprehensive music theory in\nAI-driven music generation tasks, such as algorithmic composition and style\ntransfer, which traditionally require significant manual effort with existing\ntechniques. We introduce a novel automatic music lexicon construction model\nthat generates a lexicon, named CompLex, comprising 37,432 items derived from\njust 9 manually input category keywords and 5 sentence prompt templates. A new\nmulti-agent algorithm is proposed to automatically detect and mitigate\nhallucinations.

However, when agents\nhave no prior knowledge of the reward functions, FP faces a major challenge:\nthe joint action space grows exponentially with the number of agents, which\nslows down reward exploration. Anonymous games offer a structure that mitigates\nthis issue. In these games, the rewards depend only on the actions taken; not\non who is taking which action. Under such a structure, we introduce aggregate\nfictitious play (agg-FP), a variant of FP where each agent tracks the frequency\nof the number of other agents playing each action, rather than these agents'\nindividual actions. We show that in anonymous polymatrix games, agg-FP\nconverges to a Nash equilibrium under the same conditions as classical FP.

Existing automated VA cause classification algorithms\nonly use the questions and ignore the information in the narratives. In this\nthesis, we investigate how the VA narrative can be used for automated COD\nclassification using pretrained language models (PLMs) and machine learning\n(ML) techniques. Using empirical data from South Africa, we demonstrate that\nwith the narrative alone, transformer-based PLMs with task-specific fine-tuning\noutperform leading question-only algorithms at both the individual and\npopulation levels, particularly in identifying non-communicable diseases. We\nexplore various multimodal fusion strategies combining narratives and questions\nin unified frameworks. Multimodal approaches further improve performance in COD\nclassification, confirming that each modality has unique contributions and may\ncapture valuable information that is not present in the other modality. We also\ncharacterize physician-perceived information sufficiency in VA. We describe\nvariations in sufficiency levels by age and COD and demonstrate that\nclassification accuracy is affected by sufficiency for both physicians and\nmodels.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training.

We find that lower homophily significantly increases\nmemorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less\nhomophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the\nincreased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'\nimplicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily\nregimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the\nnode labels to minimize training loss.

This question is especially timely as new humor types\ncontinuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes,\nanti-humor, AI fails).

However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of\nvisual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object\ndetection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and\nlocalization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations\ndemonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization\nand segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability,\nand complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its\nis expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of\nconventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few\nmajor limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address\nthose challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in\nthis field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in\nLVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object\ndetection and robotic applications in the future."}

Recent efforts\nto address this limitation often augment LLMs with an external memory bank, yet\nmost existing pipelines are static and heuristic-driven, lacking any learned\nmechanism for deciding what to store, update, or retrieve. We present\nMemory-R1, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that equips LLMs with the\nability to actively manage and utilize external memory through two specialized\nagents: a Memory Manager that learns to perform structured memory operations\n{ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, NOOP}, and an Answer Agent that selects the most relevant\nentries and reasons over them to produce an answer. Both agents are fine-tuned\nwith outcome-driven RL (PPO and GRPO), enabling adaptive memory management and\nuse with minimal supervision. With as few as 152 question-answer pairs and a\ncorresponding temporal memory bank for training, Memory-R1 outperforms the most\ncompetitive existing baseline and demonstrates strong generalization across\ndiverse question types and LLM backbones. Beyond presenting an effective\napproach, this work provides insights into how RL can unlock more agentic,\nmemory-aware behaviors in LLMs, pointing toward richer, more persistent\nreasoning systems."}

These issues arise because\nmost post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching\nand supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without\nexplicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human\nannotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot\nadapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to\nreward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method\nthat improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions\nvia reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two\nstages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted\nto produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the\nquestion without referring back the input image. To validate this\nself-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language\nreasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This\nself-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced\ntraining signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.\nOur experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,\nmitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts\nacross diverse vision-language tasks."}

In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for\ncharacterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key\nmeasures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior\ndata-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain\ninvariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for\ndata understanding.

We developed\nand fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label\nto each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated\nstrong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and\nF1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean\nF1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and\nPeat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or\nambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of\nthis approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily\nobtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based\non such data have many potential applications. To support use by practitioners,\nwe also provide a simple web application that classifies uploaded images using\nour model."}

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion.

Experimental results show that on\neight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation\nnetwork, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging\nconditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.\nThis work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the\ndesign of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the\nimportance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation\nlearning.

This\nin-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in\nLVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process.\nFirst, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object\ndetection, describing how these models harness natural language processing\n(NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and\nlocalization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training\nparadigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection,\nhighlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object\ndetection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of\nvisual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object\ndetection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and\nlocalization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations\ndemonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization\nand segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability,\nand complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its\nis expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of\nconventional methods in object detection.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel calibration framework that operates without access to target\ndomain information.

We\nfollow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but\nno human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D\nPseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D\nsegments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision\nand recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We\nfurther sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each\ncoherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to\ntraining a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be\nlearned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient\ndetector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior\naccuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor\nbenchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage\nmethod that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV\nclassifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both\naccuracy and speed."}

For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention.

We show\nthis by comparing real data to synthetic data generated from a memoryless\napproximation of the spatial statistics (i.e. a Markovian nonparametric model\nwith a matching distribution of saccade lengths over time).

In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture\n(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained\nfoundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of\npathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND,\nEBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art\nmethods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling."}

However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training\nsegmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation\nand error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse\nevolution layers (IELs) into the generative process.

Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced\ndiffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality\nimages.

In a centralized recommender system\n(CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and\nprovides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the\nstep of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded\nto each client.

Simply\nreweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically\nhard to learn. To address this, we propose \\textbf{DQRoute}, a modular\nframework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert\ncollaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on\nprediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to\nguide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute\nemploys a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a\ndifferent region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert\npredictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD\ndetectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized\nrouter.

As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional\nfinetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and\ngeneralised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA. Our\nfindings expose when LLM-based commonsense knowledge beats retrieval from\ncommonsense knowledge bases, how noise-aware training stabilises small models\nin the context of external knowledge augmentation, and why parameter-efficient\ncommonsense reasoning is now within reach for 250M models."}

To appear in EMNLP'25", "summary": "This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for\nin-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we\nquickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream\ninference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and\nchain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context\nlearning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of\ntoken embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the\noutput taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs\nthrough a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this\nestimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the\nsampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and\nselect $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing\nmodel outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative\nto model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models\nand datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient\nestimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than\n$\\mathbf{1}\\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset\nselection that would otherwise run full inference by up to\n$\\mathbf{37.7}\\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and\noutperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by\n$\\mathbf{11}\\%$ on average."}

Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40\ninternational fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features\n(RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations\n(CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and\nattention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic\nmasking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings\ncombined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical\nF1 (98.59\\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or\ninconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product\nrecategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which\ndiscovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with\ncluster purities above 86\\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a\ndeployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy\nwith diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more\neffectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's\nindustrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction\nintelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a\nlightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU--accelerated multimodal stage to balance\ncost and accuracy."}

An emerging class of systems promises these exciting\ncapabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over\nthe live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited\nsummaries.

Both fail to\ncapture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In\nthis work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic,\nautomated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research\nsynthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv\npapers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related\nwork sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior\nresearch. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across\nthree key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and\nverifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline\nimplemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench\nframework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems,\nsearch AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that\nDeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher\nperformance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains\nfar from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\\%$ across all\nmetrics.
